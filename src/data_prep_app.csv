Mooloolaba-based business Transportable Shade Sheds has left dozens of Australians out-of-pocket and have failed to pay their workers’ leave entitlements after going into liquidation on April 3.
The failed company is now under external administration and owes more than $1.3 million to about 160 trade suppliers and creditors.
Bill Cotter of Robson Cotter Insolvency Group was appointed liquidator of the company following its collapse.
There are an additional five other companies set up as a group of related entities which have also ceased trading including Vanquish Holdings Pty Ltd, Bend Tube Designs Pty Ltd, Sable Labour Hire Pty Ltd, Tochlo Pty Ltd and TSS Dealers Pty Ltd. 
“The businesses had ceased to trade shortly prior to the date of liquidation,” a statement from the liquidators read on its website. 
“The Liquidator will not be trading-on the business operations of the companies during the liquidation process.”
An investigation into the cause of the companies failures is now underway, with the insolvency group currently “securing and realising” the assets.
Robson Cotter from the independent boutique advisory firm told the Courier Mail there were dozens of customers who had received partial or fully incomplete orders at the time the company went broke.
“The amount potentially owing to customers with partially or fully incomplete orders delivered is currently unquantified,” he said.
Mr Cotter added several staff from the company were owed money for leave entitlements and superannuation.
Robert Salomon is understood to be the company director of Transportable Shade Sheds which was founded just over two decades ago in 2002.
Mr Salomon built the “nationally recognised company with international aspirations” alongside his partner Kylie, which offered a number of easy installation sheds, quickshades and canvacons.
“We supply our Shade Sheds as a pre-engineered kit that has been designed for anyone to erect. So, no welding or technical knowledge is required,” the company explained on its website.
“We swage the frames for you and with our slip fit connection system, it is just a matter of simply joining them together!”
The company’s website remains active despite its insolvency with customers still able to make inquiries to order products.
As for its social media pages, there were little signs to show the company was struggling, with the last post made to the Transportable Shade Sheds (TSS) Instagram and Facebook accounts asking customers to send a picture of their installed purchase.
“Happy Friday! Check out this awesome shot from one of our customers! Have you got any photos of Your Shade Shed? We’d love to see them,” the post is captioned.
“We hope you all have a nice weekend!”
Customers who have been impacted by the company’s closure have resorted to a Facebook group to vent their frustrations about the lack of notice they were given to suggest the company had gone bust. 
One loyal customer who has purchased seven sheds from the company said she ordered two sheds in June last year and paid the deposit only to never receive the products.
“I’m devastated, angry and can’t wait for karma and the legal system to catch up with them so they can pay with what they have done to us and other families, including staff,” she wrote.
“They chased us in the last two weeks for the balance of $15,000 and we refused to pay till the sheds were delivered to our premises in good order first. 
“I’m so glad we never paid them the extra money and now we have to see how we get our deposit back as we worked extremely hard for the money just like everyone else that got scammed by TSS.” 
Meanwhile one Victorian customer was left with the framework and anchors of a shed after he failed to receive its panels.
“I was told when the original framework was out for shipping, that the suppliers of the panels (are) state specific. Wondering if they are laying at a factory or depot somewhere in Victoria,” he said. 
“I really feel for those who have spent the money with zero to show for.”
A third person who claims they were a dealer and reseller for the company said he now has to find $90,000 to refund customer deposits for sheds “they are not going to get”. 
“It‘s going to put me close to the edge, but I should hopefully just be able to keep my head above water after I have refunded my customers,” he said.
“At least my customers will get every cent back whereas there must be hundreds, if not thousands of people around Australia that bought directly through them and will not get a penny back, I feel for them.”
The insolvency group recommends affected customers and creditors to submit a Proof of Debt form to register their claim via its email – admin@rcinsol.com.au.

1,facebook,news.com.au,2023-04-21,How Argylica Conditsis turned Babyboo Fashion into $60m empire,"At just 17 years old, fashion-loving Argylica Conditsis took $1000 she had saved from her part-time Pizza Hut job and invested it in her “hobby”.
The Sydney teen had a “crazy idea” to sell statement shoes, and began listing them online after embellishing and bedazzling them herself back in 2011.
They were an instant hit – and just 12 years later, her Babyboo Fashion brand has gone from a gamble that began in her bedroom to a growing fashion empire valued at a staggering $60 million.
It’s not a bad achievement for a young woman who is yet to see her 30th birthday.
“It has been a bit of a roller coaster after starting when I was really young – I had just finished high school and was on holidays between school and uni when we started,” she told news.com.au.
“I had been working late night and weekend shifts at Pizza Hut during school and making something like $6 an hour, so saving $1000 was a lot for me back then, and I put it all into stock.
“It was definitely not supposed to be a business – it was just a hobby, but when we first put the shoes online they went viral. I popped them on a Facebook page and it kind of evolved naturally over time.”
Ms Conditsis’ brother William has been with her every step of the way, and she eventually “stole him” out of uni to work on the business full time, after also dropping out of her own Visual Communications degree to focus on building up the brand. 
Within three years of launching the online business, the pair decided to expand into clothing, and after initially running Babyboo out of Ms Conditsis’ bedroom and taking over “every inch” of her parents’ Baulkham Hills home, it was soon time to expand into a proper warehouse and office.
Today, Babyboo has customers in almost 150 countries around the globe, a team of more than 40 employees and 1.1 million Instagram followers.
Ms Conditsis said one of her secrets to success was really understanding her customers from day one.
“I started bedazzling shoes myself because there were just no products like them out there … I always liked to be the one that stood out with outfits and I realised we’d have to start (making them) ourselves as there was a gap in the market,” she explained.
“If you’d told me back then we’d be as big as we are today I would have laughed at you – there’s no way I would have believed it and it is now so much bigger than I ever imagined.
“We never had a business plan or goal and each year that the business would double would come as a surprise.
“Now it’s more of a structured business with processes and strategies but in the early days it was all trial and error and learning from our mistakes quickly.”
The now-29-year-old said it was a blessing to work so closely with her brother.
“It has been great to join forces with him – we’re so alike, but have our own strengths and weaknesses that work well together,” she said.
“Will is really good at understanding operations and processes and is very creative as well, and I focus more on the product, brand and social side of things.”
She said the biggest achievement for her personally was building a business from “absolutely nothing” with no financial backing to one now valued at $60 million, which has also allowed her to build up a team and community of women who “share the same passion”.
“We empower a lot of women around the world by making them feel good, we’re with hundreds of thousands of women worldwide for all their special occasions,” she said.
“Dressing them and making them feel empowered is what gets me up every morning – it’s not just a business, it actually serves a purpose.”
However, it hasn’t all been smooth sailing.
Like most retailers, Babyboo took a hit during the Covid pandemic, but was able to quickly pivot and expand into loungewear, which was soon snapped up by those living through brutal lockdowns.
The move saw sales boom – and now, the next step for the thriving business is continuing its international expansion, settling into a new office and warehouse and launching new collections to increase the offering for customers. 
When it comes to advice for other budding young entrepreneurs, Ms Conditsis said it was simple.
“I always say never compare your chapter one to someone else’s chapter six – eventually, you’ll get there, after going through a process of evolving and learning,” she said.
“When I was young, there were a lot of people who didn’t take me seriously and I got a lot of nos, but I think most of the businesses that will rise in the coming years will be from young people, who are very in tune with social media and have a lot to offer.”",https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/sydney-woman-turns-1000-pizza-hut-earnings-into-60-million-fashion-empire-in-just-12-years/news-story/b2f4af56e67430fac8a4c5a1f3ce66b6
2,facebook,news.com.au,2023-05-09,Easy roundabout question stumping Australians in RACQ driving quiz,"A basic Aussie road rule about roundabouts has been stumping drivers across the country. 
The Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ) released its weekly quiz, this time asking Australian motorists when they should indicate when using a roundabout.
Four options were provided in the quiz: 
A) No indicator on approach and driving in the roundabout, right indicator when leaving. 
B) Right indicator on approach and driving in the roundabout, left indicator when leaving. 
C) Right indicator on approach and driving in the roundabout, no indicator when leaving.
D) No indicator on approach, right indicator when in the roundabout and left when leaving.
The correct answer is, of course, B. 
The post on Facebook has generated over 1200 comments.
And while the majority who answered were correct, many lamented the inability of road users to get it right.
One person wrote that “most people in real life don’t do it”.
Another woman wrote: “No indicator at all seems to be the rule where I live.”
Meanwhile another complained about “the amount of people I see indicating right to go straight ahead on a roundabout”.
One person noted that 95 per cent of responses had the correct answer but still “nobody indicates correctly when they are at the roundabout in their car”. 
“They either don’t indicate or indicate incorrectly,” they said.

A passer-by on Friday spotted a silver Mazda parked in what would have been a difficult position to both navigate in and out of on Sydney’s Northern Beaches. 
It was spotted on one of the main strips in Dee Why, but not in a standard parking bay. 
The vehicle was parked diagonally across the green pedestrian and cycle path that ran along The Strand. 
“Meanwhile at Dee Why,” someone captioned a photo of the car that later was shared on Facebook. 
Dozens responded in comments poking fun at the bizarre scene.
“Didn’t know Mazda launched their bicycle,” one person wrote in a comment. 
“Chill out people … This car identifies as a bicycle,” another said. 
Others were more critical of what they saw and used it as an opportunity to slam the council’s green path.
“At least someone is making use of it,” one said. 
“Nice to see it being used. Worst council idea ever. Parked cars stop the view, additional pavement not used by cafes to increase revenue, traffic gets clogged in DY,” someone else wrote. 
“Yep, this says it all. This one way trial has been poorly planned, poorly executed and poorly maintained,” a third said. ",https://www.news.com.au/technology/motoring/on-the-road/community-blasts-drivers-bizarre-parking-display-in-ritzy-suburb/news-story/6731bff0399e45d67a24af59a83f99a7

Captured by onlookers, a video shows two dogs resting at the edge of calm waters at Napranum Beach near Weipa.
Visible in the footage but unbeknown to the two dogs, a large crocodile quickly ascends, snatching the smaller of the two dogs in its mouth before hurtling it in the air and disappearing from view. 
The larger of the two dogs can be heard yelping as it runs back up the beach. 
Shortly thereafter, three dogs run down to the waters edge – barking at the creature. 
The short footage has sparked outrage by social media users, upset that people were standing idly by and filming the attack as it took place. 
Johnnina Savo, who wrote on Facebook she knew the owners of the pup who had been snatched, called the people behind the camera out. 
“Whoever was recording this video should’ve call up (sic) them puppies when you seen the croc coming instead of sitting there and f*n (sic) recording,” she wrote. 
“Bear was only a pup didn’t know better or know about the dangers of being around that animal!

5,facebook,news.com.au,2023-04-25,Dashcam footage shows girl hit by car on Melbourne street,"Terrifying dashcam footage has captured the moment a driver slams on the brakes as a young girl darts in front of his car on a Melbourne street.
“Luckily this driver was alert or this could have ended in tragedy,” wrote the Dash Cam Owners Australia Facebook page.
The video, which was filmed last Thursday afternoon, shows a young girl in pink pants dashing out from behind a parked car into the middle of the narrow street.
A man, presumably her father, has his back turned and appears to be doing some work on the house, which has a ladder propped up against the fence.
The driver slams on the brakes and the car screeches to a halt but still collides with the girl, bowling her to the ground as she tumbles over.
The man yells angrily and smashes his fist on the car’s bonnet before running to pick up the screaming girl, continuing to hurl abuse at the driver.
“She’s alright? She’s alright?” the driver asks.
Victoria Police has been contacted for comment.
On Facebook, many users said the dad was in the wrong. 
“Parent doing a parental reaction … but FFS it wasn’t the driver’s fault. Have better control of your kid around roads!” one person wrote.
“The driver showed more patience than I would have. Glad the child is not hurt, but I’d be having a hard chat with dad later about his attitude and adjusting it accordingly,” another said.
“Dad has his backed turned, completely unaware! That child is lucky to be alive,” one woman added.
“I understand the fear reaction from the dad, but the driver wasn’t responsible for the child. Thank God that child is OK. Let’s hope it’s a lesson learnt by the dad,” another woman said.
One woman said the dad had “audacity” to hit the car after his child ran onto the road, while another man added “I hope the driver is sending the father a bill for a new bonnet”.
“Good driving to hit the brakes so quick, don’t know why the father would hit the car but he should be thanking the driver,” one person agreed.
But some argued it was a natural reaction.
“Wow. So much judgment here. Until you’re in either position you have no right to judge. All parties will have PTSD from this incident if my experience is representative. Kids can be unpredictable. Thank goodness this ended the way it did for all involved – it could easily have been a tragedy,” one man said.
Another user suggested both sides bore “a bit of responsibility”.
“You should be able to stop the car if something comes out onto the road so if you don’t have a clear view due to parked cars, I’d always drive a bit slower than the marked speed limit,” he wrote.
“A worse driver and the little girl would be dead … just because a speed limit exists it doesn’t mean that’s the speed one should be driving at. I think parked cars lining a street is a bit like rain, drivers should slow down a little.”",https://www.news.com.au/technology/motoring/on-the-road/could-have-ended-in-tragedy-dashcam-footage-shows-girl-hit-by-car-on-melbourne-street/news-story/19c9f71998c6abe12ac49ec7bce759e0
6,facebook,news.com.au,2023-04-24,Aurora Australis: Strong naked eye Southern lights up Hobart Tasmanian skies,"Southern Tasmanian locals have flooded social media today with what has been described as the best Aurora Australis (aka Southern Lights) display “ever”. 
Experts say you’ll be able to see the lights from Tasmania and coastal parts of Victoria tonight, but it looks to be weaker.
Tassie is no stranger to the light event though they are usually faint and hard to spot without the aid of a long exposure photograph.
But this morning around 5.15am the display put on a show, with colourful beams reportedly visible to the naked eye. 
Toby Schrapel, a freelance photographer from The Huon Valley, 40 minutes south of Hobart, described the moment he and his son saw the rare event. 
“We could see full colour to the naked eye – not quite like what the camera sees, but it was the most colour (I’ve) ever seen,” he said. 
He had been camping with his son in the valley when it happened, and they were both blown away by the southern lights. 
“Harlan then told me ‘This is so special to see the magic sky colours with you daddy’ – So I’m never forgetting this one,” he said. 
“May have started another aurora chaser.”
A Tasmanian Facebook group dedicated to snapping and forecasting the event when it comes around was bombarded today by incredible pictures and accounts. 
“It was amazing to see beams and movement last night visible to the naked eye,” one aurora chaser wrote. 
“Absolutely insane show tonight,” another wrote. 
Auroras, also known as the Northern and Southern Lights, occur when energetic charged particles travelling along the Earth’s magnetic field lines collide with gases in the upper atmosphere, emitting light. 
Astonishingly, there are some reports of the lights even being visible in Victoria and New South Wales.

Aurora Borealis is the term used to describe the phenomenon in the northern hemisphere, while Aurora Australis is used in the south. 
These lights are most visible in Australia and New Zealand’s southern areas during this time of year, although they can occur at any time. 
According to the Australian Space Weather Forecasting Centre, auroras are most likely to appear in March and September due to the Earth’s orientation relative to the sun and the likelihood of solar storms. 
The atmosphere’s composition determines the shades of an aurora, with more oxygen-producing greens and yellows and more nitrogen resulting in dark red or blue.
Bureau of Meteorology says another aurora is likely for Australia’s far south early Tuesday morning.",https://www.news.com.au/technology/science/off-the-charts-tasmanians-treated-cops-rare-light-show/news-story/bf42a3f1c7c1bf06521caacc2d776b97
7,facebook,news.com.au,2023-05-03,Dashcam shows woman jump in front of car,"Disturbing dashcam footage has captured the moment a woman appears to leap in front of a car south of Brisbane before the driver speeds away, suspecting an “insurance fraud incident” – or worse.
The video, posted by the Dash Cam Owners Australia Facebook page, was taken in the early hours of Tuesday morning in Browns Plains, south of Brisbane.
A woman with dark hair wearing jeans and a light hoodie is seen suddenly running from the left hand side of the road in front of the moving vehicle.
She appears to brace herself and jump up towards the bonnet as the driver brakes, knocking her to the ground.
The driver reverses back as a man runs from the other side of the road to the woman’s side, yelling at the driver to stop – but the person behind the wheel drives around the couple.
“Dashcam footage of alleged insurance fraud incident,” the page wrote. 
“There were several people approaching from behind the vehicle instantly after the incident, driver fled due to risk of carjacking/suspecting a fraudulent claim at 3am in Browns Plains.”
A Queensland Police spokeswoman said police were “aware of a video circulating on social media where a female walks out in front of a vehicle and is struck on Browns Plains Road at Browns Plains on May 2”.
“The driver reported the incident to police shortly after the incident,” she said.
“Police attended the location but were unable to locate those involved. No formal complaint has been made to police at this time however investigations are ongoing into the circumstances surrounding the incident.”
The video has been viewed more than 70,000 times with nearly 1000 comments.
“I had one of them,” one man wrote.
“I drove off as there was a group of them hiding in the bushes. They called the police and reported a hit [and] run. Police came and watched my dashcam with front and rear cameras. 
“No action was taken as the girl did the exact same thing. Ran out and I stopped. Then she bumped into my car. It’s a scam and an attempt at carjacking. This is very common in Europe and becoming common here. Mine occurred down the Gold Coast.”
“That must have hurt … hopefully!” a woman said.
“So he gets his missus to take the hit, what a kind and considerate guy he is,” another man added.
“Finally natural selection is coming back … but to help the selection process don’t hit brakes,” a fourth person wrote.
One woman sparked disbelief with her take on the video.
“They are kidding aren’t they?” she wrote. “They knocked her down and drove away. If they were scared they could [have] backed off and locked their doors, call an ambulance.”
One person replied, “You’ve lived a sheltered life haven’t you.”
Another said, “You’re the kind of person who gets carjacked.”
A third woman explained, “If this happened to me, and a group of people were surrounding my car and approaching on all angles, I’d be getting the hell out of there as well. 
“A locked door means little when the window is smashed and you’re dragged out of it. That and it’s clearly a fake accident. 
“She threw herself into the bonnet when she realised the car was stopping short.”

0,facebook,Guardian,2023-05-09,Facebook blocks Rockhampton mob leader as Queensland MP prepares to meet with him,"First Nations people in central Queensland say the state government is inflaming local tensions by pushing ahead with plans to meet with the former leader of a far-right “patriots” group, who was booted off Facebook after leading a mob to surround the Rockhampton home of an Indigenous teenager. Guardian Australia on Tuesday revealed that the ringleader of the group, Torin O’Brien, is the former president of a group that regularly posted offensive anti-Islam content online. O’Brien referred to himself online as part of the “Infidel Legion” and made comments calling Muslim people “knuckle draggers”. Last week, he posted the names and photographs of two Aboriginal young people, believed to be teenagers, on Facebook and accused them of criminal activity. O’Brien then corralled locals to attend their home on Sunday. On Tuesday, Facebook deleted O’Brien’s profile for breaching the platform’s community standards, while Labor MPs defended the decision to meet with him. The former One Nation candidate, who was portrayed as an “anti-crime crusader” in some media reports, was invited to sit down “with police and other stakeholders”, as community tensions related to youth crime escalate. Alwyn Doolan, a Gooreng Gooreng and Wakka Wakka man from the Aboriginal community of Woorabinda, west of Rockhampton, said the government had legitimised a “mob”. “The community is very wary,” Doolan said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoonemail newsletters for your daily news roundup “This fella shouldn’t have any dealings with government and I don’t understand why Annastacia Palaszcuk is not out clearly condemning this as well.” Doolan said Aboriginal people in the community were “looking over their shoulder” and worried about the potential of being misidentified or subject to violence. O’Brien has been contacted for comment. The Facebook group he created – to organise community members to go to the homes of people he accused of being criminals – remains online. Posts in the group use racist slurs to refer to Indigenous people. One post, about a “race war”, said: “bring it on that would mean we could legally go and get these dogs”. Guardian Australia has also seen posts by far-right groups that appear designed to fan racial tensions in Queensland and promote vigilante actions. The MP for Rockhampton, Barry O’Rourke, confirmed he invited O’Brien to attend a meeting “with police and other stakeholders”. “There is no place for mob action. I completely agree with the police commissioner that this kind of behaviour is extremely dangerous and unhelpful. We’ve seen this kind of behaviour lead to innocent people being harmed or killed in the past and that’s what we desperately want to avoid in Rockhampton,” O’Rourke said. “The contempt we saw for police on the weekend was especially worrying. “That is why I have invited Mr O’Brien to attend a meeting with police and other stakeholders – it’s an opportunity for him to air his views the right way, and also an opportunity for police to emphasise the risks to himself and others from these actions. No one wants to see this escalate.” The Queensland police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, told reporters on Monday that information posted online was not correct and urged Queenslanders not to take the law into their own hands. Asked on Tuesday why police were meeting with O’Brien, Carroll said it’s “incredibly important to meet with everyone”. She said police were still investigating whether charges should be laid. “It’s incredibly important that, irrespective of what your background is, to give those people perspective, and to actually tell them what they’re doing is not quite correct,” she said. The police minister, Mark Ryan, said it was “good representation” for local MPs to meet with members of their community. Asked whether this included those who espouse anti-Islam beliefs, Ryan said “just because you meet with someone doesn’t mean you agree with them”. “You can be appalled by someone’s views but nonetheless your role is to listen to people,” he said. Members of Rockhampton’s Indigenous community are planning to meet this week, to discuss issues of youth crime, “vigilante groups” and children’s safety in the city.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/10/facebook-blocks-rockhampton-mob-leader-as-queensland-mp-prepares-to-meet-with-him

The Facebook and Meta founder won gold and silver medals at his very first Brazilian jiu-jitsu tournament in Redwood City, California, to the shock of many in the martial arts community and probably more widely. The 38-year-old tech billionaire said he took up an interest in the sport early on in the pandemic and he posted his win on Instagram, saying: “Competed in my first jiu-jitsu tournament and won some medals for the Guerrilla Jiu Jitsu team.” One of his coaches, Khai “the Shadow” Wu, congratulated his student: “Yesterday getting to see Zuck compete was pretty epic. No match was easy and everything was earned. It was an honor to be able to help coach and offer any advice I could.” Zuckerberg received support for his new hobby from several high-profile athletes. Former UFC champion and student of anger management Conor McGregor commented on the post: “Yo!!! F***ing awesome Mark.” Brazilian Bernardo Faria, the five-time world jiu-jitsu champion, said of Zuckerberg’s win: “Amazing!!! Half guard, arm-bars, triangle! Super cool!’” Other celebrities also congratulated the tech nerd-turned-athlete on his success. US TV host and former teen heartthrob Mario Lopez commented with three fire emojis. Other famous people have also taken up the sport. Actor Ashton Kutcher, who took up jiu-jitsu more than a decade ago, has a brown belt in the sport. Actor Jason Statham and comedian Russell Brand have purple belts. The Peaky Blinders and Venom star Tom Hardy also competes in the UK, and has won competitions in Wolverhampton and Milton Keynes.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/08/facebook-founder-mark-zuckerberg-jiu-jiutsu
2,facebook,Guardian,2023-05-04,Facebook and WhatsApp owner urged by UK bank to act on fraud as scams soar,"Meta has been urged to take action to protect customers from fraud, after TSB said scams via the social media company’s platforms Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram have soared. The UK bank said there had been a huge jump in the number of scams originating from Meta-owned sites and apps, releasing research that shows they now account for 80% of cases within TSB’s three largest fraud categories: impersonation, purchase and investment. Its findings follow the announcement on Tuesday of a government crackdown on scammers in response to the massive growth of web-based fraud, including a ban on technology that allows mass texting of numerous phones. Paul Davis, the director of fraud prevention at TSB, said: “Social media companies must urgently clean up their platforms to protect the countless innocent people who use their services every day. “In the meantime, we are urging the public to remain cautious to potential scam content – and to spread the word to help protect those around you. “It’s high time that social media and telephone companies took financial liability for the rising levels of fraud taking place on their platforms.” Impersonation scams originating on Meta’s platforms accounted for 86% of cases in that category recorded by TSB between 2021 and 2022, with two-thirds of those incidents coming from WhatsApp. “Family and friends” fraud cases via the mobile messaging platform rocketed by 300% in a year, according to TSB analysis of its fraud data, and the bank refunded more than 550 victims. The scam involves a con artist posing as a friend or relative of the victim. They get in touch via WhatsApp or another messaging platform and gain the target’s trust before asking for money. TSB warned consumers to be vigilant to any unexpected messages purporting to be from family or friends, and advised contacting the individual directly before sending a payment. Meanwhile, the bank found that 80% of purchase fraud cases – where someone is tricked into buying a product or service that does not exist – began via Meta’s platforms. Most of these originated through Facebook Marketplace, where incidents of fraud almost doubled in one year. TSB refunded 2,100 cases from this platform under the bank’s fraud refund guarantee. The research also found that scams taking place through Meta account for almost 87% of all investment fraud cases at TSB, and they predominantly begin on Instagram and Facebook. TSB fraud experts urged consumers to stick to recognised investment platforms and to avoid social media “get rich quick” schemes. A Meta spokesperson said: “This is an industry-wide issue and scammers are using increasingly sophisticated methods to defraud people in a range of ways including email, SMS and offline. “We don’t want anyone to fall victim to these criminals which is why our platforms have systems to block scams, financial services advertisers now have to be FCA authorised and we run consumer awareness campaigns on how to spot fraudulent behaviour. “People can also report this content in a few simple clicks and we work with the police to support their investigations.”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/05/facebook-whatsapp-instagram-fraud-scams-tsb-meta
3,facebook,Guardian,2023-05-03,US regulators may ban Facebook from monetizing data from children,"The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is accusing Facebook of misleading parents about protections for children and is proposing to tighten an existing agreement on privacy to include a ban on profiting from minors’ data. The FTC said on Wednesday that Facebook misled parents about how much control they had over who their children had contact with in the Messenger Kids app and was deceptive about how much access app developers had to users’ private data, breaching a 2019 agreement on privacy. The FTC’s proposed changes include barring Facebook from making money off data collected on users under age 18, including in its virtual reality business. It would also face expanded limitations on using facial recognition technology. Shares of Meta, Facebook’s parent company, fell as much as 2% after the news. A Meta spokesperson, Andy Stone, said on Twitter that the move was a “political stunt”. “We will vigorously fight this action and expect to prevail,” he wrote. The FTC’s action on Wednesday is the first step in the process of changing the 2019 agreement. Facebook will have 30 days to answer. The company can appeal any commission decision to an appeals court. “Facebook has repeatedly violated its privacy promises,” said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “The company’s recklessness has put young users at risk, and Facebook needs to answer for its failures.” The FTC has twice before settled with Facebook over privacy violations. The first time was in 2012. Facebook agreed in 2019 to pay a record $5bn fine to resolve allegations it had violated a 2012 consent order by misleading users about how much control they had over their personal data. That order was finalized in 2020. Meta is one of several social media giants to face scrutiny in recent years over potential harms its products pose to children. Meta leaders testified in front of Congress after revelations from whistleblower Frances Haugen that the company knew it steered young users towards damaging content that could have severe mental health impacts. Other social media firms have also faced increasing pressure surrounding the inability to control misinformation and hate speech on their platforms, an issue that was the subject of multiple congressional hearings in recent years. Still, little concrete action has been taken by Washington to address the concerns. As national legislation stalls, consumer rights groups applauded the FTC’s move, describing it as a positive step towards creating more robust protections for children online. “Kids should never have been used as an engine of profit for Meta, and it’s great that the FTC is continuing to act aggressively,” said Lisa Gilbert, executive vice-president of the progressive non-profit Public Citizen. “Until Congress acts on its promise to ensure privacy for kids and adults online, it’s critical that the agency boldly enforces the law.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/03/ftc-facebook-meta-messenger-kids-data-privacy
4,facebook,Guardian,2023-05-03,Mirror publisher blames revenue decline on Facebook changes,"The publisher of the Mirror, Express and Daily Star newspapers has blamed changes in the way Facebook displays news content for a slide in its digital revenues. Reach, which also owns hundreds of regional newspapers including the Birmingham Mail, Liverpool Echo and Manchester Evening News, reported a fall in group revenue of almost 6% for the four months to 23 April. It has previously announced plans to slash hundreds more jobs amid a £30m cost-cutting drive as it battles higher costs resulting from inflation and disappointing advertising sales. The newspaper group, which owns a network of regionally focused news websites including Glasgow Live and Hampshire Live, said it had experienced a slowdown in the number of page views from online readers, with changes to the presentation of news by Facebook reducing traffic to its sites. Reach’s digital revenues have slumped by almost 15% since January and it warned of a challenging environment for digital advertising. However, it said its print revenue remained strong, and it had continued to sell “robust” quantities of newspapers. The company said revenue from print circulation rose by 2% over the period, as it benefited from higher prices it is charging for its newspapers that were introduced last year. Print advertising was slightly ahead of expectations. Jim Mullen, Reach’s chief executive, said: “External factors continue to impact digital revenue, delivery of the customer value strategy is driving a higher quality mix, underpinned by the strength of print. “Our focus on data, means customers are receiving and responding more often to relevant content and a more engaging user experience.” Reach, which is holding its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, said it was continuing with its plans to cut its operating costs by 5-6% this year, adding that its actions to do so were “well advanced”. The publisher warned in March that up to 420 staff could face redundancy as part of its cost-cutting plans, including 192 journalists, only weeks after announcing it would cut 200 jobs. Reach added it was continuing its investment in a digital operation to tap the US market, and had almost 100 full-time staff in place before its launch of US websites for the Mirror and the Express in the coming months.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/03/mirror-publisher-blames-revenue-decline-on-facebook-changes-reach

6,facebook,Guardian,2023-04-27,How Facebook and Instagram became marketplaces for child sex trafficking,"Maya Jones* was only 13 when she first walked through the door of Courtney’s House, a drop-in centre for victims of child sex trafficking in Washington DC. “She was so young, but she was already so broken by what she’d been through,” says Tina Frundt, the founder of Courtney’s House. Frundt, one of Washington DC’s most prominent specialists in countering child trafficking, has worked with hundreds of young people who have suffered terrible exploitation at the hands of adults, but when Maya eventually opened up about what she had been through, Frundt was shaken. Maya told Frundt that when she was 12, she had started receiving direct messages on Instagram from a man she didn’t know. She said the man, who was 28, told her she was really pretty. According to Frundt, Maya told her that after she started chatting with the man, he asked her to send him naked photos. She told Frundt that he said he would pay her $40 for each one. He seemed kind and he kept giving Maya compliments, which made her feel special. She decided to meet him in person. Then came his next request: “Can you help me make some money?” According to Frundt, Maya explained that the man asked her to pose naked for photos, and to give him her Instagram password so that he could upload the photos to her profile. Frundt says Maya told her that the man, who was now calling himself a pimp, was using her Instagram profile to advertise her for sex. Before long, sex buyers started sending direct messages to her account, wanting to make a date. Maya told Frundt that she had watched, frozen, what was taking place on her account, as the pimp negotiated prices and logistics for meetings in motels around DC. She didn’t know how to say no to this adult who had been so nice to her. Maya told Frundt that she hated having sex with these strangers but wanted to keep the pimp happy. One morning three months after she first met the man, Frundt says that Maya was found by a passerby lying crumpled on a street in south-east DC, half-naked and confused. The night before, Maya told her, a sex buyer had taken her somewhere against her will, and she later recalled being gang-raped there for hours before being dumped on the street. “She was traumatised, and blamed herself for what happened. I had to work with her a lot to help her realise this was not her fault,” said Frundt when we visited Courtney’s House last summer. Frundt, who has helped hundreds of children like Maya since she opened Courtney’s House in 2008, says that the first thing she now does when a young person is referred to her is to ask for their Instagram handle. Other social media platforms are also used to exploit the young people in her care, but she says Instagram is the one that comes up most often. In the 20 years since the birth of social media, child sexual exploitation has become one of the biggest challenges facing tech companies. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the internet is used by human traffickers as “digital hunting fields”, allowing them access to both customers and potential victims, with children being targeted by traffickers on social media platforms. The biggest of these, Facebook, is owned by Meta, the tech giant whose platforms, which also include Instagram, are used by more than 3 billion people worldwide. In 2020, according to a report by US-based not-for-profit the Human Trafficking Institute, Facebook was the platform most used to groom and recruit children by sex traffickers (65%), based on an analysis of 105 federal child sex trafficking cases that year. The HTI analysis ranked Instagram second most prevalent, with Snapchat third. Grooming and child sex trafficking, though often researched and discussed together, are distinct acts. “Grooming” refers to the period of manipulation of a victim prior to their exploitation for sex or for other purposes. “Child sex trafficking” is the sexual exploitation of a child specifically as part of a commercial transaction. When the pimp was flattering and chatting with Maya, he was grooming her; when he was selling her to other adults for sex, he was trafficking. Though people often think of “trafficking” as the movement of victims across or within borders, under international law the term refers to the use of force, fraud or coercion to obtain labour, or in the buying and selling of non-consensual sex acts, whether or not travel is involved. Because, under international law, children cannot legally consent to any kind of sex act, anyone who profits from or pays for a sex act from a child – including profiting from or paying for photographs depicting sexual exploitation – is considered a human trafficker. Meta has numerous policies in place to try to prevent sex trafficking on its platforms. “It’s very important to me that everything we build is safe and good for kids,” Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder, wrote in a memo to staff in 2021. In a statement responding to a detailed list of the allegations in this piece, a Meta spokesperson said: “The exploitation of children is a horrific crime – we don’t allow it and we work aggressively to fight it on and off our platforms. We proactively aid law enforcement in arresting and prosecuting the criminals who perpetrate these grotesque offences. When we are made aware that a victim is in harm’s way, and we have data that could help save a life, we process an emergency request immediately.” The statement cited the group director of intelligence at the charity Stop the Traffik, who is former deputy director of the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency, who has said “millions are safer and traffickers are increasingly frustrated” because of their work with Meta. But over the past two years, through interviews, survivor testimonies, US court documents and human trafficking reporting data, we have heard repeated claims that Facebook and Instagram have become major sales platforms for child trafficking. We have interviewed more than 70 sources, including survivors and their relatives, prosecutors, child protection professionals and content moderators across the US in order to understand how sex traffickers are using Facebook and Instagram, and why Meta is able to deny legal responsibility for the trafficking that takes place on its platforms. While Meta says it is doing all it can, we have seen evidence that suggests it is failing to report or even detect the full extent of what is happening, and many of those we interviewed said they felt powerless to get the company to act. The survivors * * * Courtney’s House sits on a quiet residential street on the outskirts of Washington DC. Inside, Frundt and her team have tried to make the modest two-storey house feel like a family home, with comfortable sofas and photos on the mantlepiece. Frundt, who was herself trafficked as a child in the 1980s and 90s, is now one of Washington DC’s most experienced and respected anti-trafficking advocates. Warm and ferociously protective of the children in her care, she is contracted by the city’s child protection services to identify trafficked children going through the court system, and she regularly attends court hearings for the youth in her care. She also helps train the FBI and local law enforcement sex-trafficking units on how to spot traffickers on online platforms, including Instagram. “When I was trafficked long ago I was advertised in the classified sections of freesheet newspapers,” Frundt told us. “Now my youth here are trafficked on Instagram. It’s exactly the same business model but you just don’t have to pay to place an ad.” The children who are referred to Frundt, usually by the police or social services, have been sexually exploited and controlled: by a boyfriend, a pimp, a family member. Some of them are as young as nine. Almost without exception, they have childhoods scarred by sexual abuse, poverty and violence. This makes them perfect targets for sexual predators. “They are all looking for love and affirmation and a sense that they mean something,” said Frundt. Almost all the young people who come to Courtney’s House are children of colour. They are, Frundt said, battling stereotypes that pressure them to become sexualised too early and make them vulnerable to traffickers. A 2017 study by the Georgetown Law Center on Poverty and Inequality found that adults typically regard Black girls as less innocent and more knowledgable about sex than their white peers. The same study showed that Black girls are often perceived to be older than they are. Most of the time, Frundt says, the children who come to Courtney’s House are still being trafficked when they walk through the door. Even in cases where they have escaped their exploiters, she said, explicit videos and photos of them often continue to circulate online. Traffickers will lock victims out of their accounts, preventing them from taking down images posted to their profiles. When we asked Frundt if she could show us examples of young people in her care who she says are currently being trafficked on Instagram, she pulled out her phone and scrolled through post after post of explicit images and videos of girls as young as 14 or 15. Most of the photos and videos seemed to have been taken by someone else. Frundt said that these posts were being used as a way of advertising the girls for potential sex buyers, who would send a direct message to buy explicit content or to arrange a meet up. At one point, our conversation was interrupted by the arrival of five teenage girls. They had come back from school, and they gathered around the kitchen table, chatting and playing music on their phones while Frundt served them casserole. After they had eaten, we asked if we could talk to them about their experiences: had any of them been sexually exploited on social media or had explicit videos or pictures posted of them? They glanced at each other and burst out laughing. Yes, they said, of course. All the time. One girl said she felt that “nobody at Instagram cares, they don’t care what’s posted. They don’t care shit about us.” Frundt claims that she is constantly asking Instagram to close accounts and take down exploitative content of kids in her care. “I even have law enforcement calling me up asking, ‘Tina, can you get Instagram to do something?’. If I can’t get Instagram to act, what hope is there for anyone else?” When we put these concerns to Meta, a spokesperson said: “We take all allegations and reports of content involving children extremely seriously and have diligently responded to requests from Courtney’s House. Our ability to remove content or delete accounts requires sufficient information to determine that the content or user violates our policies.” Frundt says that in 2020 and 2021 she had discussions with Instagram about conducting staff training to help prevent child trafficking on its platforms. She says the training didn’t go ahead as, after a long back and forth, on a video call Instagram executives said that they wouldn’t pay Frundt her standard fee of $3,000, instead allegedly offering $300. When we put this to Meta, they did not deny it. The court documents and the prosecutors * * * What makes social media platforms so powerful as a tool for traffickers – far more powerful than the back pages of a newspaper in which Frundt was advertised as a teenager – is the way that they make it possible to identify and cultivate relationships with both victims and potential sex buyers. Traffickers can advertise and negotiate deals by using different features of the same platform: sellers sometimes post publicly about the girls they have available, and then switch to private direct messages to discuss prices and locations with buyers. US court documents provide a graphic insight into how these platforms can be used. In one case prosecuted in Arizona in 2019, Mauro Veliz, a 31-year-old who was convicted of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of a child, exchanged messages on Facebook Messenger with Miesha Tolliver, who also received jail time for sex trafficking. Tolliver told Veliz that she had one girl available for sex, and photographs of two more, before saying that the girls were aged 17, 16 and 14. Veliz: “How much is it for all of them?” Tolliver: “The 14 [year-old] will cost the most … a couple of hundred for her but [$] 150 for the rest” The 14-year-old, Tolliver told Veliz, was “new to the sex game”. Tolliver: “The 1 on the right … is 16 with a fat ass ... the other [is] 15 with huge tits” The court transcripts then state that multiple sexually explicit images of the girls were sent to Veliz. Tolliver: “do you want me to bring 1 of the girls with me so you guys can fuck?” [ ... ] Veliz: “is your girl nervous? Or have you told her yet?” Tolliver: “… shes still young and doesn’t understand how ppl like it” Tolliver and Veliz exchanged more messages, arranging for Veliz to meet the girl in a hotel in California two days later. The final message submitted to the court was from Veliz to Tolliver. “We’re finished she’s in the restroom,” it said. Luke Goldworm, a former assistant district attorney in Boston, Massachusetts, who has investigated and prosecuted human trafficking cases for years, says that he has encountered numerous exchanges like this one. From 2019 until he left the job in October 2022, he said, his department’s caseload of child-trafficking crimes on social media platforms increased by about 30% each year. “We’re seeing more and more people with significant criminal records move into this area. It’s incredibly lucrative,” he said. A trafficker can make up to $1,000 a night. Many of the victims he saw were just 11 or 12, he said, and most of them were Black, Latinx or LGBTQI+. According to Goldworm, while his investigations involved every social media platform, Meta platforms were the ones he encountered most often. Six other prosecutors in several different states told us that, in their experience, Facebook and Instagram are being widely used to groom children and traffick children. Five of these prosecutors spoke of their anger over what they felt were Meta’s unnecessary delays in complying with judge-signed warrants and subpoenas needed to gather evidence on sex trafficking cases. “We get a higher rate of rejected warrants from Facebook than any other electronic service provider,” claimed Gary Ernsdorff, senior deputy prosecuting attorney for King County, Washington state. “What I find frustrating is that the exchange can delay rescuing a victim by a month.” Three of these prosecutors described experiences where they say the company would cite technicalities, picking faults with wording and format, and slowing down investigations. In response, the company said that these claims were “false”, adding that between January and June last year, it “provided data in nearly 88% of requests from the US government”. The responsibility for reporting * * * Meta acknowledges that human traffickers use its platforms, but insists that it is doing everything in its power to stop them. By law, the company is required to report any child sexual abuse imagery shared over its platforms to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC), which receives federal funding to act as a nationwide clearing house for leads about child abuse. Meta is a major funder of NCMEC, and holds a seat on the company’s board. From January to September 2022, Facebook reported more than 73.3m pieces of content under “child nudity and physical abuse” and “child sexual exploitation” and Instagram reported 6.1m. “Meta leads the industry in using the most sophisticated technology to detect both known and previously unknown child exploitation content,” said a company spokesperson. Of the 34m pieces of child sexual exploitation content removed from Facebook and Instagram in the final three months of 2022, 98% was detected by Meta itself. But the vast majority of the content that Meta reports falls under child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) – which includes photos and videos of pornographic content – rather than sex trafficking. Unlike with child sexual abuse imagery, there is no legal requirement to report child sex trafficking, so NCMEC must rely on all social media companies to be proactive in searching for and reporting it. This legal inconsistency – the fact that child sexual abuse imagery must be reported, but reporting child sex trafficking is not legally required – is a major problem, says Staca Shehan, vice-president of the analytical services division at NCMEC. “It’s concerning across the board how little trafficking is being reported,” Shehan says. Social media companies “are prioritising what’s [legally] required”. “I think everyone could do more,” Shehan says. “The volume of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and volume of trafficking [being reported] is like apples and oranges.” According to Shehan, one further reason for this disparity, beyond the differing legal requirements, is technological. “Child sexual abuse material is that much easier to detect. There are so many technology tools that have been developed that allow for the automated detection of that crime.” A NCMEC spokesperson told us that if social media companies are not reporting child sex trafficking, it allows this crime to thrive online. Reporting trafficking, they emphasised, is crucial for rescuing victims and punishing offenders. Between 2009 and 2019, Meta reported just three cases as suspected child sex trafficking in the US to NCMEC, according to records disclosed in a subpoena request seen by the Guardian. A spokesperson for NCMEC confirmed this figure, but clarified that a number of child trafficking cases during the same time period were reported by Meta under other “incident types”, such as child pornography or enticement. “I think one of the things to be aware of is that is that there’s sort of a singular tag that’s used for reporting,” Antigone Davis, head of global safety at Meta, emphasised to us in a recent interview. “And so just because something isn’t tagged as sex trafficking doesn’t mean that it isn’t being reported.” A Meta spokesperson claimed that over the past decade, the company had reported “tens of thousands of accounts which violated our policies against child sex trafficking and commercial child sexual abuse material to NCMEC.” When we put these claims to NCMEC, it said that it had not received “tens of thousands” of reports of child trafficking from Meta, but had received that number related to child abuse imagery. Hany Farid is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley who helped invent the PhotoDNA technology that Meta uses to identify harmful content. He believes Meta, which is currently valued at more than $500bn, could do more to combat child trafficking. It could, for instance, be investing more to develop better tools to “flag suspicious words and phrases on unencrypted parts of the platform – including coded language around grooming,” he said. “This is, fundamentally, not a technological problem, but one of corporate priorities.” (There is a separate debate about how to handle encryption. Meta’s plans to encrypt direct messages on Facebook Messenger and Instagram has recently drawn criticism from law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and Interpol.) In response to Farid’s claims and further questions from the Guardian, Meta did not specify how much money it has invested in technologies to detect child sex trafficking, but said that it had “focused on using AI and machine learning on non-private, unencrypted parts of its platforms to identify harmful content and accounts and make it easier for people to report messages to the company so we can take action, including referrals to law enforcement”. Davis also emphasised that Meta constantly works with partners to improve its anti-trafficking safeguards. For instance, she mentioned that “we’ve been able to identify the kinds of searches that people do when they’re searching for trafficking content, so that when people search for that, we will pop up with information to divert them or to let them know that what they’re doing is illegal activity”. These efforts have failed to satisfy some of Meta’s own investors. In March, several pension and investment funds that own Meta stock launched legal action against the company in Delaware over its alleged failure to act on “systemic evidence” that its platforms are facilitating sex trafficking and child sexual exploitation. By offering insufficient explanation of how it is tackling these crimes, the complaint says, the board has failed to protect the interests of the company. Meta has rejected the basis for the lawsuit. “Our goal is to prevent people who seek to exploit others from using our platform,” the company said. The moderators * * * As well as software, Meta uses teams of human moderators to identify cases of child grooming and sex trafficking. Until recently, Anna Walker* worked the night shift in an office of a Meta subcontractor. She would start each shift filled with dread. “We were just, like, shoved in a dark room to look at the stuff,” she said. Walker’s job was to review interactions between adults and children on Facebook Messenger and Instagram direct messenger that had been flagged as suspicious by Meta’s AI software. Walker claims she and her team struggled to keep pace with the huge backlog of cases. She says she saw cases of adults grooming children and then making plans to meet them for sex, as well as discussions about payment in exchange for sex. Walker’s managers would pass on such cases to Meta to decide if action should be taken against the user. In some cases, Walker claims: “Months would pass and then the automatic bot would send me an email saying it was closing this case, because nobody’s taken action on it.” She added: “I would cry to my manager about [the children I saw] and how I want to help. But it felt like nobody would pay attention to these horrible things.” We talked to six other moderators who worked for companies that Meta subcontracted between 2016 and 2022. All made similar claims to Walker. Their efforts to flag and escalate possible child trafficking on Meta platforms often went nowhere, they said. “On one post I reviewed, there was a picture of this girl that looked about 12, wearing the smallest lingerie you could imagine,” said one former moderator. “It listed prices for different things explicitly, like, a blowjob is this much. It was obvious that it was trafficking,” she told us. She claims that her supervisor later told her no further action had been taken in this case. When we put these claims to Meta, a spokesperson said that moderators such as Walker do not typically get feedback on whether their flagged content has been escalated. They stressed that if a moderator does not hear back about a flagged case, that does not mean no action has been taken. Five of the moderators claimed that it was harder to get cases escalated or content taken down if it was posted on closed Facebook groups or Facebook Messenger. Meta “would be less stringent about something taking place behind ‘closed doors’,” claimed one team leader. “With Messenger, we really couldn’t make any moves unless the language and content was really obvious. If it was four guys who trusted each other and it was in a group it could just live on for ever.” Meta said these allegations “appear to be misleading and inaccurate” and said it uses technology to find child sexualisation content in private Facebook groups and on Messenger. In 2021, former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked internal documents that seem to support the moderators’ claims. These documents, which numbered thousands of pages, detailed how the company managed harmful content. In one memo from the Haugen leak, the company states that “Messenger groups with less than 32 people should be treated with a full expectation of privacy”. Matias Cruz*, who worked as a content moderator from 2018 to 2020, reviewing Spanish-language posts on Facebook, believes that the criteria that Meta was using to recognise trafficking was too narrow to keep up with traffickers, who would constantly switch codewords to avoid detection. According to Cruz, traffickers would say: “‘I have this cabra [Spanish for goat] for sale,’ and it’d be some really ridiculous price. Sometimes they would just outright say [the price] for a night or two, or ‘an hour’.” It was obvious what was going on, said Cruz, but “the managers would claim it was too vague, so in the end they would just leave it up”. Cruz and three other moderators we spoke to claimed that in examples like this, where their managers felt there was insufficient evidence to escalate the case, moderators could receive lower accuracy scores, which in turn would affect their performance assessments. “We would take negative hits on their accuracy scores to try to get some help to these people,” Cruz said. The limits of the law * * * While the law requires Meta to report any child exploitation imagery detected on its platforms, the company is not legally responsible for crimes that occur on its platform, because of a law created almost three decades ago, in the early days of the internet. In 1996, the US Congress passed the Communications Decency Act, which was primarily intended to ensure online pornographic content was regulated. But section 230 of the act states that providers of “interactive computer services” – which includes the owners of social media platforms and website hosts – should not be treated as the publisher of material posted by users. This section was included in the act to ensure the free flow of information while protecting the growing tech industry from being crushed by litigation. Whereas a newspaper, say, must legally defend what it publishes, section 230 means that a company like Meta, which hosts the content of others, may not be held liable for what appears on its platforms. Section 230 therefore positions internet service providers as fundamentally neutral: offering forums in which illegal, harmful or false content may be posted and circulated, but ultimately not responsible for that content. Since the passing of the act, tech companies such as Meta have argued successfully in courts across the US that section 230 provides them with complete immunity from prosecution for any illegal content published on their platforms, as long as they are unaware of that content’s existence. The debate around section 230 has become highly polarised. Those who want section 230 amended say that the legal safe harbour it has provided for internet companies means they have no incentive to root out illegal content on their sites. In an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal in January, President Biden spoke out in favour of the section’s reform. “I’ve long said we must fundamentally reform section 230,” he wrote, calling for “bipartisan action by Congress to hold big tech accountable.” However, tech companies, along with internet freedom groups, argue that changes to section 230 could lead to censorship and an erosion of privacy, particularly for private, encrypted content. These arguments over section 230 are being put to the test in a landmark case that has reached the US supreme court, which focuses on how far YouTube can be considered culpable for the videos it recommends to its users. A ruling is due by the end of June. The consequences * * * Kyle Robinson is one year into serving a 10-year sentence at a federal prison in Massachusetts for sex trafficking two teenagers, one only 14 years old. We spoke to him in January over the muffled line of the prison’s payphone, our conversation interrupted by prison staff monitoring the call. Referring to himself as a pimp, Robinson described how he sought out damaged girls from care homes and on social media as a way to make money. Instagram, he said, was his platform of choice. “I find the girls that have pride in themselves, but maybe don’t have the confidence, the self-esteem,” he claimed. “I make her feel special. I give her validation, social skills, her ‘hotential’, if you know what I mean.” Once he had identified his targets, Robinson claimed that he would “coach” them and advertise them on their Instagram accounts and his own. He would talk to potential buyers through direct messages, offering to send video snippets of the girls in return for “a small deposit” – about $20 – so that the buyers could see what they would be getting. If a buyer decided to meet a girl, he would pay her the rest of the money later, via CashApp, he said. Robinson would then take most of that money. To crack down on such cases of child sexual exploitation, last June Meta announced new policies including age verification software that will require users under 18 to provide proof of age through uploading an ID, recording a video selfie, or asking mutual friends on Facebook to confirm their age. When we asked Tina Frundt about these new measures, she was sceptical. The kids she works with had already found workarounds; a 14-year-old, for example, might use a video selfie made by her 18-year-old friend, and pretend that it’s her own. Even after children have been referred to Courtney’s House, they continue to be vulnerable to traffickers. One night in June 2021, Frundt says she got a call from Maya, telling her she had arrived home safe. Frundt was relieved: she knew that Maya had spent the evening with a 43-year-old man who had been contacting her on Instagram. Frundt says that Maya, now 15, was in a fragile state: over the previous few months, her mental health had been in sharp decline and she had told Frundt she’d been feeling suicidal. Photos and explicit videos taken by a pimp showing her having sex were being circulated and sold on Instagram. Sex buyers were contacting her relentlessly through her direct messages. “She didn’t know how to make it stop or how to say no,” Frundt recalled. That night, on the phone, Frundt told Maya that she loved her and that they would talk in the morning. “That’s the last time I ever spoke to her,” said Frundt. The older man had given Maya drugs. When Maya’s mother went to wake her daughter the next morning, she found her dead. A picture of Maya that still hangs on the wall of Courtney’s House shows a baby-faced teenage girl with brown curls and a huge smile. Two years after her death, Frundt continues to grieve for her caring “girly girl” who loved makeup, board games and dancing to her favourite Megan Thee Stallion songs. “Losing one of our youth, it changes you for ever. You can never forgive yourself,” she said. Before Maya died, Frundt claims she spoke to Instagram on a video call, asking them to remove the exploitative content her trafficker had circulated. Frundt says that when Maya died, the videos of her being exploited were still on the platform. In July 2021, a representative from an anti-trafficking organisation sent an email to Instagram’s head of youth policy, informing her of Maya’s death. Frundt was copied in on the email. It asked why Meta’s tools designed to detect grooming had not flagged a 43-year-old man contacting a young girl. Four days later, the company sent a brief reply. If Instagram was provided with details about the alleged trafficker’s account, it would investigate. But Frundt says that it was too late. “She had already passed,” she says. “They could have done something to help her but they didn’t. She was gone.” Names marked with an asterisk have been changed to preserve anonymity. • In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453.

7,facebook,Guardian,2023-04-20,"Trade in fake reviews still ‘thriving’ on Facebook, says Which?","Facebook groups offering fake reviews on the likes of Amazon, Google and Trustpilot are still persistent despite regulators’ demands that tech platforms do more to tackle the issue, according to an investigation by a consumer group. Groups on the social network with thousands of members offer free products in exchange for reviews, said the consumer group Which?, despite past interventions by UK regulators. Researchers found 14 Facebook groups trading in reviews for Amazon, Google and Trustpilot. Together they shared more than 62,000 members between them. Fake reviews have become one of the most persistent scourges of online retailers, and the UK government is expected to make the practice illegal in the forthcoming digital markets, competition and consumer bill. The bill would make it illegal to pay someone to write a fake review or to host a review without taking steps to check it is real. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority told Facebook to clamp down on fake reviews in 2020 and again in 2021, when the social network removed more than 16,000 groups. Which? estimates that the groups it has reported to Facebook since 2018 have had more than 1 million members in total. Rocio Concha, the consumer group’s director of policy and advocacy, said: “An industry dedicated to fake review trading continues to thrive on Facebook, leaving consumers exposed to misleading information on some of the world’s biggest review and shopping platforms.” She said the “strong enforcement and tough penalties for platforms that fail in their legal responsibilities” promised by the UK government was “sorely needed to tackle fake reviews”. A spokesperson for Meta, Facebook’s parent company, said: “Fraudulent and deceptive activity is not allowed on our platforms, including offering or trading fake reviews. We’ve removed the groups shared with us for violating our policies. While no enforcement is perfect, we continue to invest in new technologies and methods to protect our users from this kind of content.” Six of the newly identified groups offered free products in exchange for Amazon reviews. One group identified by Which?, “Amazon Reviewer - Test Products”, counted 15,000 members. On a group sharing that name, the Guardian found posts appearing to ask for UK, US and French buyers of products including a garlic crusher, wireless headphones, and designer-imitation handbags. Comments on the groups and the research by Which? suggested that users would buy the products, and then receive a refund once they had given a five-star review. Spokespeople for Amazon and Trustpilot said they actively monitored Facebook groups and reported incentivised reviews, and that they employed teams of investigators. “By taking this action against fraudsters, we are going after the source of the problem and shutting down these fake review businesses,” the Amazon spokesperson said. The Trustpilot spokesperson said: “We closely monitor Facebook groups claiming to sell fake reviews on Trustpilot, and we take strong and robust action to combat the practice.” A Google spokesperson said: “Our policies clearly state reviews must be based on real experiences, and when we find policy violations, we take swift action ranging from content removal to account suspension and even litigation.”",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/apr/21/trade-in-fake-reviews-still-thriving-on-facebook-says-which
8,facebook,Guardian,2023-04-20,Crime agencies condemn Facebook and Instagram encryption plans,"An alliance of the world’s most powerful law enforcement agencies including the FBI, Interpol and Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA) have condemned Meta’s plans to encrypt direct messages on Facebook Messenger and Instagram, saying that doing so will weaken the ability to keep child users safe. The Virtual Global Taskforce, made up of 15 agencies, is chaired by the NCA and also includes Europol and the Australian federal police among its membership. The VGT has spoken out, it says, owing to the “impending design choices” by Meta, which it says could cause serious harm. The decision to encrypt direct messages on the platforms, which would prevent anyone other than the intended recipient being able to intercept the communications, “is an example of a purposeful design choice that degrades safety systems and weakens the ability to keep child users safe”, the alliance said. The VGT praised Meta’s work with the American National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which acts as a clearing house for reports on online child sexual abuse. Meta reported more such cases to the NCMEC than any other provider, the alliance said, but it feared that lead would disappear once the messages are “end-to-end encrypted” (E2EE). “The VGT has not yet seen any indication from Meta that any new safety systems implemented post-E2EE will effectively match or improve their current detection methods,” it said. Citing the case of David Wilson, who was jailed in 2021 for abusing 52 children, the VGT predicted similar arrests could prove impossible with encryption enabled. “The successful prosecution of Wilson and the resulting safeguarding of hundreds of children was possible because law enforcement were able to access the evidence contained within over 250,000 messages through Facebook. In an E2EE environment, it is highly unlikely this case would have been detected.” In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said: “The overwhelming majority of Brits already rely on apps that use encryption. We don’t think people want us reading their private messages, so have developed safety measures that prevent, detect and allow us to take action against this heinous abuse, while maintaining online privacy and security. “As we continue to roll out our end-to-end encryption plans, we remain committed to working with law enforcement and child safety experts to ensure that our platforms are safe for young people. “In the case of David Wilson, we submitted Cybertips to authorities using both public and private information,” the spokesperson added. “We have developed detection systems using behavioural signals and other account activity that are not reliant on the content of private messages to identify malicious actors like David Wilson. It’s misleading and inaccurate to say that encryption would have prevented us from identifying and reporting accounts like David Wilson’s to the authorities.” Plans to encrypt all messages on Meta’s platforms were first revealed in 2019, when the company was still called Facebook. But they have been delayed a number of times, because of technical hurdles and regulatory pressure. In April 2021, the company announced the integration would not happen until 2022 at the earliest, before pushing the deadline back to 2023 in November 2021. “We’re taking our time to get this right,” Meta’s head of safety, Antigone Davis, said when the latest delay was announced. “As a company that connects billions of people around the world and has built industry-leading technology, we’re determined to protect people’s private communications and keep people safe online.” But in the years since, Meta has given few details on how the push to encrypt communications by default would avoid harsh trade-offs against its existing child safety practices. Davis said Meta would be able to detect abuse by using non-encrypted data, account information and reports from users. Meta’s third messaging platform, WhatsApp, already uses a similar approach to tackle child sexual abuse but makes far fewer referrals to NCMEC as a result. In March 2022, the non-profit released data showing Facebook made 22m reports of online exploitation of children in 2021, while WhatsApp made just 1.3m. Other encrypted platforms with similar user bases were even worse: Apple, which runs iMessage, reported just 160 cases. VGT’s intervention comes two days after WhatsApp joined forces with other encrypted messaging apps, including its rival Signal, to call on the UK government to protect E2EE in the online safety bill. The services hinted they may be forced to leave the UK, rather than obey the new law, if it attempted to criminalise encryption.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/20/crime-agencies-condemn-facebook-instagram-encryption-plans
9,facebook,Guardian,2023-04-13,Essex police examine golly doll pub landlord’s ‘racist’ Facebook posts,"Police investigating an alleged hate crime over the display of golly dolls in an Essex pub are to examine online messages by the pub’s landlord in which he apparently joked about Mississippi lynchings alongside an image of the racist dolls. Christopher Ryley, the licensee of the White Hart Inn in Grays, Essex, regularly posts on Facebook to express far-right views and share content from anti-immigrant commentators such as Katie Hopkins. In March 2016, in a Facebook post still online, Ryley uploaded a picture of golly dolls hanging from his bar with the comment “We have our golliwogs, yaay.” Commenting on the post his wife, Benice Ryley, asked: “Are you sure this is legal. lol.” The landlord replied: “They used to hang them in Mississippi years ago.” Essex police confiscated the golly dolls last week after receiving a complaint about an alleged crime. The force has now confirmed that detectives conducting the investigation are aware of Ryley’s Facebook posts. It is understood the posts are being reviewed as part of the investigation. Ryley is due to be interviewed by Essex police next month when he returns from the family’s holiday home in Marmaris, on the southern Turkish coast. It is believed the investigation is focusing on establishing whether he intended to cause offence by displaying the dolls. One other possible line of inquiry is whether his posts flout the 1988 Malicious Communication Act. Earlier this week, a source close to Suella Braverman suggested Essex police had been reprimanded by the home secretary. The police force denied this. In 2018 Ryley was asked by his local council to explain the dolls in the pub’s bar but denied they were racist. Posting about that on Facebook, he said: “Today I’ve had a call from our council licencing dept because some ‘Snowflake’ has decided that they think they are racial. They have even gone to the police to complain that it could constitute ‘racial aggrevation’ I never invited this person in, if they are not happy, go elsewhere. Our customers bring these items in from their travels. We have a lot of ‘coloured customers’ who have never complained.” In July last year he complained about the prospect of a Muslim prime minister, in an apparent mistaken reference to Rishi Sunak, who is a Hindu. He said: “We now have the prospect of a Muslim PM, along with … other Muslim mayor’s throughout the UK. Don’t get me wrong, I choose to live in a Muslim country, here in Turkey. Did all the UK population agree to live under a Muslim regime? Muanmar Kadaffi said in 2008, we don’t need guns or bombs. We will simply out breed Europeans.” In May 2021 Ryley complained about media coverage of the US police murder of George Floyd, writing: “Why are MSM dragging up George Floyd a year after he died? What about our own ppl who have died, Lee Rigby, why does he not get mentioned. Sorry, I forgot, he was white. That don’t count.” In 2017, Ryley likened the C2C train line connecting Essex to central London to an image of an Indian railway engine with dozens of people clinging on outside. That year he also shared a photograph of activists from the far right group Generation Identity unfurl a banner that said “Stop Islamification” from London’s Westminster bridge. On Tuesday, Benice Ryley denied the dolls were racist and has since replaced them. Christopher Ryley has been approached for comment. Meanwhile, Chris Philp, the policing minister, speaking about the confiscated dolls, said it was “up to police to decide how they respond to incidents”. Asked on LBC why it took five police staff to remove the collection, Philp said: “I’m not going to answer yes or no because they’re operationally independent and it’s up to police to decide how they respond to incidents, not up to me to tell them what to do or to offer comments after the event.” Sunder Katwala, the director of the integration thinktank British Future, said: “It is important that police can do their job. These Facebook posts are important because they suggest the intent of displaying the golliwogs is to depict a lynching, or hanging, which takes us into much stronger territory of harassment and racially aggravated hate crime than the impression some people have that they were just teddy bears and golliwogs sitting on a shelf.” He added: “Saying this is just a joke is clearly intended to be quite aggressive and intimidatory. It isn’t the sort of joke that the council or the police should allow in a pub.” • This article was amended on 13 April 2023 to rename the dolls in line with style guidance.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/13/essex-police-investigating-golliwog-pub-display-examine-landlord-lynching-post
10,facebook,Guardian,2023-03-27,Meta slammed over scam ads on Facebook featuring Australian TV personalities,"Australia’s broadcast industry group has condemned Facebook’s parent company Meta over its handling of scam ads featuring TV stars including David Koch and Karl Stefanovic, saying the company’s response time is inadequate and damages broadcaster reputations. Free TV Australia – which represents broadcasters including Seven, Nine and Ten – said in a submission published this month to a Senate inquiry into digital platforms that scam ads featuring their networks’ stars without the network or star’s knowledge or authorisation, and fake news stories had been causing harm to consumers over the past few years. The group highlighted scam ads on Facebook featuring fake endorsements from the Nine news reporter Georgie Gardner for an app, a fake account purporting to be the former Today Show host Allison Langdon encouraging people to enter a scam competition seeking bank details, and scam cryptocurrency ads featuring the Today host Karl Stefanovic and Sunrise host David Koch. “His image was used as one of many fake celebrity endorsements that baited and lured users into scam bitcoin investments,” Free TV said regarding the fake Koch ads. The group said scammers had also created fake Seven-branded Facebook pages and replied to users in the comment sections on Seven’s Facebook posts, telling them they’d won a prize. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission launched a case in the federal court in March last year alleging Meta had “aided and abetted” celebrity scam ads that had cost some Australians hundreds of thousands of dollars. In its own submission to the inquiry, the ACCC said the losses from scam ads on social networks had almost doubled from a reported $49m in 2020 to $92m in 2021. These figures are likely to be much higher because most victims do not report their losses to Scamwatch. The case had yet to be heard, and Free TV Australia said despite the regulator taking this step, Meta’s takedown processes remained “inadequate”. “Fake ads continue to quickly reappear after they are taken down. These inadequate takedown processes damage the business reputations of broadcasters and also the personal reputations of the celebrities and media personalities that are misrepresented,” the organisation said. “Notwithstanding the significant consumer harm from these scams, in addition to the reputational harm to Free TV members, the digital platforms are persistently slow in responding to takedown requests.” Free TV said the social media platforms should be required to ensure that the content they were publishing was not “fake, damaging, misleading or defamatory”, and called for a social media code specifically targeting scam ads. A spokesperson for Meta said scammers were a challenge across the board online, not just limited to social media platforms. “We’re committed to safeguarding the integrity of our services, and dedicate substantial resources and technology solutions to protect our community from fake accounts and other inauthentic behaviour,” the spokesperson said. In the ACCC’s fifth interim report arising from the digital platforms inquiry in November, the regulator recommended to the government that the digital platforms should appropriately verify advertisers to reduce the risk of scams, and implement a “notice-and-action” mechanism that would require the platforms to take action when a user reports a scam. The sixth interim report is due this week.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/28/australian-tv-networks-criticise-meta-over-inadequate-response-time-to-damaging-scam-ads
11,facebook,Guardian,2023-03-23,From Facebook intern to the crosshairs of Congress: TikTok chief’s stellar rise,"Shou Zi Chew has said the most gruelling experience of his life was a five-day survival course in the jungles of Borneo when he was serving as a conscript in Singapore’s armed forces. The TikTok chief executive, whose trans-global academic and business career has rapidly propelled him to the top job at one of the world’s biggest tech companies, will need to display some of that mettle as he battles to ensure the corporate survival of the controversial but immensely popular social video app. The 40-year-old Singaporean, who faces questioning by US lawmakers on Thursday amid talk of a possible ban in the US, came from a relatively modest background: his father worked in construction and mother in bookkeeping. His fate was transformed at the age of 12 when high marks on a national exam got him into an elite high school, where he added fluency in Mandarin to his native English. Following his military service – Chew is a reservist officer in the Singaporean army until he is 50 – he obtained a bachelor’s degree in economics from University College London. He stayed on in the UK capital, becoming a banker at Goldman Sachs for two years, investment experience that would eventually lead him to meet a young Zhang Yiming, the founder of TikTok’s parent, ByteDance, when he was developing the company in a crammed apartment in Beijing’s university district. In 2010, Chew gained his MBA from Harvard Business School, where he got his first experience of life in the tech sector with an internship at Facebook while the social networking company was still in startup mode before going public in 2012. It was also where he met his Taiwanese-American future wife Vivian Kao, with whom he has two children. Chew – whose TikTok profile was created in February last year and has just 23 posts, including videos of him attending the Super Bowl and NBA games as well as meeting celebrities such as Bill Murray – does not allow his children to use the app, having said last November that they are “too young”. After business school, Chew joined the venture capital firm DST, founded by the Israeli-Russian IT billionaire Yuri Milner, where his Mandarin qualified him to be its China-focused partner. This would see him make his pivotal visit to Zhang’s ByteDance in 2012 before the team created TikTok, resulting in Chew and his partners investing in the startup the following year. He also led investment in Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone maker with global ambitions to take on Apple, which he joined as chief financial officer in 2015 at the age of 32. Chew helped to secure financing that led to the company’s public listing three years later. At the time this was one of China’s biggest ever tech initial public offerings, although its share performance has since been mixed. He was made head of its international business in 2019. In 2021, Zhang persuaded Chew to join ByteDance as its first chief financial officer. Two months later, he was elevated to chief executive following the abrupt departure of the former Disney executive Kevin Mayer after just three months, as the Trump administration attempted to force a sale of TikTok’s US assets. Chew’s rise to the top of the tech industry landed him a spot on Fortune’s 40 under 40 list in 2021. The low-profile exec is now embarking on a media offensive as part of TikTok’s wider efforts to galvanise support to avert a ban in the US and other countries. “This could take TikTok away from all 150 million of you,” he said in a post appealing to US TikTok users.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/23/tiktok-harvard-graduate-ceo-battles-us-market-shou-zi-chew
12,facebook,Guardian,2023-02-28,How can I avoid a rip-off on Facebook Marketplace?,"Within the space of a week I have, admittedly through my own naivety, been ripped off twice on Facebook Marketplace. My daughter wanted a copy of the game The Last of Us for her PlayStation. I found a copy on the site, and contacted the seller. He asked for £25 paid by PayPal “friends and family”. I refused at first but in the end relented. The game failed to arrive, and I have had no further contact. The account is still active despite me telling Facebook. The same thing happened to me again with a second purchase. What should I have done? DH, by email It is baffling that people will send money to people they don’t know purely on the basis they have posted something for sale on Facebook Marketplace. The online small ads site has boomed in popularity, not least because, unlike eBay, it is free to list items. It has largely replaced small ads in local papers, and the idea is you pick it up in person and hand over the cash. If the item is too far away, and the seller is offering to send it, then alarm bells should ring. Don’t send the money as a bank transfer, unless you are happy to take the risk of the item not arriving. In my view, it is unrealistic to think that Facebook will intervene, and consumers should protect themselves. The only way to do it safely is to use PayPal – but not through the friends and family option which is free to both parties – but using the “goods and services” option. Legitimate sellers won’t mind but they may charge extra to cover the PayPal fee they face. If the item fails to arrive at your registered address you can claim a refund. If that is not an option, don’t bother, however much of a bargain. Switch to eBay, or pick it up in person. This applies to Gumtree, too. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

13,facebook,Guardian,2023-02-25,Facebook ads opposing a ban on vaping in Australia failed to disclose tobacco company backing,"A pro-vaping lobby group has run a series of advertisements targeting those over 18 without disclosing the ads were sponsored by big tobacco, despite Facebook requiring groups advertising political or social issues to disclose who paid for the ad. An initiative of British American Tobacco Australia, “Responsible Vaping Australia” emerged in November, and on Facebook describes itself as an “education research centre”. It claims to represent retailers who want to sell vapes responsibly. In late December, just after the federal health minister, Mark Butler, announced the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) had opened sweeping vaping reforms to consultation, Responsible Vaping Australia launched its advertisements. But the ad campaigns, including the latest which ran from 13-19 February, do not target retailers. Facebook data from the February campaign shows users aged 18 and above with an interest in nightclubs, pubs, bars and clubbing subculture were the target audience, and were where the bulk of the advertising spending was directed. Advertisers can select the demographics, interests and behaviours of people they want to see their ads. The ads state that “Australia needs practical, common sense solutions on vaping policy. The government wants to hear from you” and link to a petition calling on the government to exempt nicotine vaping products from the Poisons Standard and to allow retailers to sell nicotine vaping products. The latest ad states “Australia’s current laws have created an enormous demand for black market vaping products”. The ad carried no required disclaimers about who funded it. According to Meta, which owns Facebook, “Advertisers can’t run ads that promote the sale or use of tobacco or nicotine products or related paraphernalia, including, but not limited to: electronic cigarettes, vaporisers or other products that simulate smoking”. However, the ads were allowed because they promoted “social issues” tied to vaping. It is unclear how long the ads were allowed to remain public. Only 16 of 31 ads appear to have run with disclaimers. Many of the disclaimers simply say “sponsored” without saying by whom. A Meta spokesperson told Guardian Australia: “These ads were not selling vaping products but promoting social issues tied to vaping to Australians aged 18 and over. Social issues, electoral and political related ads are held to a higher standard and required to include a ‘Paid for by’ disclaimer. We removed these ads for breaching social issues advertising policy because they did not include this disclaimer.” Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Public health experts say a blanket ban on the import and sale of vaping products without a prescription – whether those products contain nicotine or not – needs to be implemented to prevent importers from dodging import laws and to protect children, who are buying the products from convenience stores where they are not asked for ID. While pro-vaping groups label such a move as “prohibition,” public health groups argue there is nothing prohibitive about allowing adults who are trying to quit smoking access nicotine vaping products with a prescription, in the same way many other medicines and treatments are managed. A tobacco control expert and professor of public health with the University of Sydney, Becky Freeman, said it was misleading for Responsible Vaping Australia to label itself as an education and research group given its clear political agenda. “I don’t see any evidence of any ‘education or research’ in the content of the Facebook page,” Freeman said. “This is a campaign with financial ties to BAT [British American Tobacco Australia] that is actively lobbying to overturn Australian vaping laws. “Facebook claims to have policies that ban the advertising of tobacco and vaping products, but then openly allow this front group to target young Australians.” Guardian Australia has contacted Responsible Vaping Australia for comment. Despite being an Australia-focused group, most of the administrators of the Responsible Vaping Australia page are in Hong Kong and Pakistan. While public health experts have been complaining to Facebook about the page description since December, after receiving questions from Guardian Australia the Facebook page administrators changed the description from being a “research and education” group to a ‘health/medical/pharmacy’ group. The “organisation managing this page” section was empty as of Friday. Tobacco control expert Prof Simon Chapman said people should be wary of providing their details to the Responsible Vaping Australia website and petition. “They don’t say how exactly they will use your information,” he said. “They will have a heap of potential data there for future lobbying, and maybe even for future marketing.” Pro-vaping groups such as Responsible Vaping Australia argue that convenience stores and tobacconists are experienced sellers of nicotine vaping products and are best placed to sell the products to adults. In his submission to the TGA vaping reform consultation, Chapman questioned this, saying retailers already “totally ignore” a ban on selling the products to children. “Significant proportions of children who vape report it easy to purchase Nicotine Vaping Products,” his submission says. The TGA told Guardian Australia it had received close to 4,000 submissions to the consultation. “This means that the work to progress the submissions to publication is taking some time, including because it is necessary to redact certain personal information and defamatory content prior to publication,” a TGA spokesperson said. “Submissions will be published as soon as possible following this process.” Overseas pro-vaping groups are among the submissions. This includes the Coalition of Asia Pacific Tobacco Harm Reduction Advocates (Caphra), which is an affiliate of the Swiss-based International Network of Nicotine Consumer Organisations that has received grants from the Philip Morris-International (PMI)-funded Foundation for a Smoke Free World (FSFW). Caphra’s members include the Hong Kong/Bangkok-based Factasia, which openly states it has received financial support from PMI for many years. It also receives funding from the Australian Taxpayers Alliance, which runs a Legalise Vaping Australia campaign. The World Vapers Alliance – exposed by media organisations Le Monde and the Daily Beast last year as being funded and directed by British American Tobacco – has also made a submission.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/26/facebook-ads-opposing-a-ban-on-vaping-in-australia-failed-to-disclose-tobacco-company-backing
14,facebook,Guardian,2023-02-20,Does paid-for Facebook and Instagram signal end of free-access orthodoxy?,"Mark Zuckerberg’s social media empire is built on billions of users – and the advertisers who pay vast sums to grab their attention. But that business model is under pressure on several fronts. It is against this backdrop that Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said on Sunday it is trialling subscriptions for both social media platforms. “Advertising has paid for editorial content and other things for centuries,” says Johnny Ryan, a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and a campaigner for stronger protection of internet users’ data. “I do not see that changing. But the tracking-based ads that snoop on our every move are the historical anomaly, and they are on the way out.” Facebook and Instagram offer a goldmine of user data for advertisers. Facebook alone has 2 billion daily users, while across all of Meta’s platforms including Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger the total is just under 3 billion. Facebook generates revenue from building profiles of those users and matching them with advertisers, who direct ads at people targeting their specific interests and background. This advertising-based model accounted for 98% of Meta’s $116.6bn in revenues last year, but it faces problems. In 2021, Apple introduced privacy changes that required apps sold on the Apple store to ask users permission to track their activity across other apps and the internet – a key means of gathering data for targeted adverts. Of course, many users have opted not to be tracked, and Meta warned that the change would reduce its 2022 ad revenue by $10bn. Regulators loom as well. Last month Meta’s business model was dealt a blow by a ruling that the company’s legal justification for targeting users with personalised ads broke EU data laws. Meta said the ruling did not prevent targeted or personalised advertising, but it is very clear what the EU, which is a highly influential tech regulator, thinks about Meta’s user data-oriented business model. Then there is general economic weakness, to which any advertising-dependent social media or search company is susceptible. In its most recent quarterly results, Meta reported a 4% drop in revenue while other platforms, including Snap, Google and Elon Musk’s Twitter, have also warned of a weak advertising environment. Musk has launched a revamped Twitter subscription service to offset the company reliance on advertising, although its ad business has also suffered self-inflicted blows. Dan Ives, an analyst at the US financial services firm Wedbush Securities, says launching a subscription service is an obvious response to challenges that have already resulted in Meta announcing plans to cut 11,000 jobs. “Meta is seeing clear headwinds on the digital advertising model and this is a low-hanging-fruit way to potentially pick up some incremental revenue,” he says. Under the Meta Verified offering, users will pay a monthly subscription fee – $14.99 for people using the Facebook or Instagram app on an Apple iPhone or an Android phone, with a lower charge of $11.99 for web access – to enjoy features including: a verified badge on your account, certified by a piece of government ID; a monitoring service to deter account impersonators; increased visibility and reach for your account, such as in search and recommendations; and personal support for problems with your account. It is being tested in Australia and New Zealand and Meta says it hopes to bring the new product to the rest of the world “soon”. An obvious market for the service is the creators and influencers who use Meta’s platforms, particularly Instagram. Meta says it will help “up and coming” creators, adding that “subscribers with a smaller following may see a more noticeable impact to their reach”. Kat Molesworth, co-founder of the Creator Union, which hopes to start recruiting members this year, says Meta should not be charging for services she suggests should come as standard: “I would question if it’s appropriate to charge creators, who contribute to Meta’s massive profits, for basic features.” Referring to Google-owned YouTube’s practice of sharing advertising proceeds with creators, she adds: “YouTube shares revenues pretty much 50/50 with its creators and has done for over a decade. YouTube recognises that without creators it would not have an ad business.” On Sunday, Musk described Meta’s move as “inevitable”; although whether it is destined to succeed, after nearly two decades of free-access orthodoxy at Zuckerberg’s business, is a different matter.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/20/facebook-instagram-paid-for-signal-free-access-meta

His mother, Jennifer Miller, has since “persisted” to obtain answers from various government agencies about the circumstances surrounding her son’s debt, including writing to the former human services minister Alan Tudge, whose response said his department had acted appropriately in the case with only some “minor” errors. But, until today, Miller was stonewalled at every turn, she has told in inquiry into the scheme. “Through the royal commission, I have been able to obtain the truth,” she told a hearing today. (Watch the video.) This week commences the final round of hearings of the robodebt royal commission, which is investigating the Coalition-era scheme that sent hundreds of thousands of people unlawful demands for money from their own government. The inquiry has surfaced many other harrowing stories of how government failure impacted the most vulnerable in our society.

16,facebook,Guardian,2023-02-20,Facebook and Instagram to get paid verification as Twitter charges for two-factor SMS authentication,"Facebook and Instagram users will soon need to pay to be verified on the social media platforms, as Meta follows in the footsteps of rival platform Twitter. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, announced in a Facebook post on Sunday that the service would first roll out in Australia and New Zealand later this week. The company said it would cost US$11.99 a month on web or US$14.99 on iOS and Android (or, in Australia, $19.99 on web or $24.99 on iOS and Android). Zuckerberg said in addition to a blue badge the service would offer “extra impersonation protection”, improved reach for verified users and direct access to customer support. In a blog post, Meta said it would rely on government ID documents to prove the identity of verified accounts, to avoid the embarrassment of accounts impersonating people and brands – as happened when Twitter initially rolled out its paid verification service. Accounts must also have a posting history and users must be at least 18 years old. The service would not be available to businesses at this stage, Meta said. The increased visibility of posts from verified users would “depend on a subscriber’s existing audience size and the topic of their posts”, the company said. Those with smaller audiences might see more of an impact. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The company said it would also offer “exclusive stickers” on Facebook and Instagram stories and Facebook reels. Meta cut 11,000 staff in November – the equivalent of 13% of its workforce – amid falling ad revenue and economic downturn. The company’s share price fell by more than 70% in 2022 before a rebound and in July it reported its first ever fall in revenue. Twitter’s CEO, Elon Musk, responded to the news in a tweet saying it was “inevitable” Meta would follow Twitter. Twitter restricts SMS two-factor authentication to paid accounts Separately, Twitter announced on Friday it would provide SMS-based two-factor authentication only to users who are subscribed to the US$8-a-month ($11.65) Twitter Blue service from 20 March. The company currently provides free two-factor authentication through third-party apps and a security key, which are considered more secure than SMS-based systems. If non-subscriber accounts that use SMS authentication do not switch before the deadline, Twitter said it would disable two-factor authentication for that account. The move has sparked concerns that it could lead to widespread hacks on accounts next month if they fail to switch over. Twitter’s last transparency report prior to Musk’s takeover shows that as of December 2021, although just 2.6% of active Twitter accounts use two-factor authentication, 74.4% of those use SMS as their method of authentication. Musk has claimed Twitter was being “scammed” US$60m a year from fake two-factor authentication messages. He separately supported a tweet claiming the scams were being run by telecommunications companies that had set up bot accounts to run the two-factor authentication process to get revenue from the text messages from Twitter.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/20/facebook-instagram-paid-meta-verification-twitter-charge-2fa-two-factor-authentication-via-sms
17,facebook,Guardian,2023-02-04,‘I couldn’t stop thinking about it’: one woman’s hunt for Facebook Marketplace treasure,"When Jorja Brown moved into a Melbourne rental, owning only a bookshelf and a bed just as the Covid pandemic took hold, she knew furnishing her new home would be a challenge. In her search for essential items, such as a couch, the vintage interiors curator took to the treasure-filled quagmire of Facebook Marketplace, and soon found herself obsessing over a 2 x 1.5m weaving made of pure alpaca wool and depicting a trio of musicians. Unfortunately, she’d missed the deal. With the piece still on her mind days later, Brown reached out to the seller for more details. “She couldn’t tell me much, just that she’d bought it while travelling in South America. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning “But I couldn’t stop thinking about it … I even reverse-image searched it [on Google], but nothing came up.” She contacted the seller again. “I asked if she’d help put me in touch with whoever bought it, but she wouldn’t. I had to tell myself: ‘Let it go, it’s not meant to be.’” A few weeks later, Brown was scrolling through eBay in search of a dining table. She says her eyes “instantly lit up” when she noticed a floor rug in one of the thumbnail photos. Some quick inquiries revealed it was the very same weaving she’d coveted , already back on the market. “I just love the line work. You don’t know what it is at glance and that makes you look at it longer and deeper.” And more serendipity was to come. “I drove out and met [the seller], we ended up chatting for two hours about art and design – he was a curator himself.” After hearing her enthusiasm for transitioning to a new career in interiors, Brown says the seller gifted her several motivational books, and suggested she start with Now is the Time by Patrick Lindsay. “It took me about six months to get the courage to quit my job, but that book was really the seed,” says Brown. She is now self-employed and runs a vintage furniture and home decor business from her home. As Brown’s business grows, the weaving often makes a background appearance in photos of furnishings and homewares. “People often ask about it, but it’s definitely not for sale.” • This article was amended on 10 February 2023.

18,facebook,Guardian,2023-02-03,"Scams: FCA blocks more than 10,000 ads from Instagram, Facebook and YouTube","More than 10,000 misleading financial promotions and scams aimed at consumers via social media sites such as Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok have been identified and targeted by the financial watchdog during the past year. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the use of social media marketing channels and the rise of so-called “fin-fluencers” – particularly directing investment products at younger age groups – exploded last year, resulting in a record number of takedown notices and alerts. The FCA ordered businesses to amend or remove 8,582 promotions during 2022, 15 times the 573 recorded the previous year. It also published almost 1,900 alerts to consumers about potential scammers, up more than a third up on 2021. Google, which owns YouTube, Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, TikTok, Twitter and Microsoft’s Bing have changed advertising policies to ensure that regulated firms are involved in adverts for financial products after FCA intervention. However, the regulator said it was still monitoring whether the companies were effectively blocking illegal adverts. “More needs to be done by tech companies to protect consumers,” the FCA said. “Given the substantial number of illegal promotions we continue to identify, our expectation is that every social media platform improves their capability to identify and remove the illegal financial promotions on a proactive basis.” The crackdown included taking action against a company that attempted to take advantage of the cost of living crisis, targeting more than 70,000 online followers that the FCA deemed were potentially vulnerable consumers. An online retail broker with more than 1.1 million UK customers, with a primary market of millennial age investors, was ordered to halt a marketing campaign after the FCA identified “serious concerns” that its promotions, which used social media influencers, were “targeting vulnerable customers with significant debt”. The FCA also sought to get an unregistered cryptocurrency exchange offering products to UK consumers to be shut down, and separately alerted 55 consumers who had been identified on a scammers list targeting consumers who had been searching for loans online. “Financial promotions must be fair, clear and not misleading,” said Sarah Pritchard, executive director, markets, at the FCA. “This year, we will continue to put pressure on people using social media to illegally promote investments, which put people’s hard-earned money at risk.” The FCA said advances in the technology it uses to identify problem firms and misleading adverts had also fuelled the increase in cases last year. It has hired more than 100 people in roles such as machine learning and data analysis to build automated tools to scan thousands of websites every day. The watchdog said it looked at about 180,000 websites last year, resulting in about 4,500 websites and social media platforms being reviewed. This resulted in 1,441 alerts being issued and 400 of the offending websites being taken down. Last year, the Advertising Standards Authority sent enforcement notices to 50 firms in the cryptocurrency sector warning them that they must clearly explain the risks for potential investors. The watchdog slapped bans on a bitcoin firm for urging that it was “time to buy” or miss out, and on football club Arsenal’s campaign to get fans to buy its crypto “tokens”.",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/feb/03/scams-fca-blocks-more-than-10000-ads-from-instagram-facebook-and-youtube
19,facebook,Guardian,2023-01-31,TechScape: Why Donald Trump’s return to Facebook could mark a rocky new age for online discourse,"It’s been two years since Donald Trump was banned from Meta, but now he’s back. The company’s justification for allowing the former president to return to Facebook and Instagram – that the threat has subsided – seems to ignore that in the two years since the ban Trump hasn’t changed, it’s just that his reach has reduced. Last week, Meta’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, announced that soon Trump will be able to post on Instagram and Facebook. The company said “the risk has sufficiently receded” in the two years since the Capitol riots on 6 January 2021 to allow the ban to be lifted. What you might not have been aware of – except through media reports – was Trump’s response. That is because the former US president posted it on Truth Social, his own social media network that he retreated to after he was banned from the others. And it is effectively behind a wall for web users, because the company is not accepting new registrations. On that platform, Trump is said to have fewer than 5 million followers, compared to 34 million and almost 88 million he’d had on Facebook and Twitter respectively. Meta’s ban meant that Trump wouldn’t have space on its platforms during the US midterms elections in 2022, but would anything have been different if Trump had been given a larger audience? As Dan Milmo has detailed, almost half of the posts on Trump’s Truth Social account in the weeks after the midterms pushed election fraud claims or amplified QAnon accounts or content. But you wouldn’t know it unless you were on that platform, or reading a news report about it like this one. If given a larger audience, will Trump resume his Main Character role in online discourse (a role that Twitter’s new owner, Elon Musk, has gamely taken on in the past few months)? Or has his influence diminished? This is the gamble Meta is taking. When Musk lifted Trump’s ban on Twitter in November after a user poll won by a slim margin, it was easy to read the former president’s snub of the gesture as a burn on the tech CEO. But it seems increasingly likely that the Meta decision about whether to reinstate him was looming large in Trump’s mind. Earlier this month, NBC reported that Trump’s advisors had sent a letter to Meta pleading for the ban to be lifted, saying it “dramatically distorted and inhibited the public discourse”. If Trump had gone back to Twitter and started reposting what he had posted on Truth Social, there would have been more pressure on Meta to keep the ban in place (leaving aside the agreement Trump has with his own social media company that keeps his posts exclusive on Truth Social for several hours). Twitter lifting the ban and Trump not tweeting at all gave Meta sufficient cover. The financials There’s also the possible financial reasoning. Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters for America, said Facebook is “a dying platform” and restoring Trump is about clinging to relevance and revenue. For months, Trump has been posting on Truth Social about how poorly Meta is performing financially, and in part trying to link it to him no longer being on Facebook. Meta has lost more than US$80bn in market value, and last year sacked thousands of workers as the company aimed to stem a declining user base and loss of revenue after Apple made privacy changes on its software (£). But what of the ‘guardrails’? Meta’s justification for restoring Trump’s account is that there are new “guardrails” that could result in him being banned again for the most egregious policy breaches for between one month and two years. But that is likely only going to be for the most serious of breaches – such as glorifying those committing violence. Clegg indicated that if Trump is posting QAnon-adjacent content, for example, his reach will be limited on those posts. The ban itself was a pretty sufficient reach limiter, but we will have to see what happens if Trump starts posting again. The unpublished draft document from staff on the January 6 committee, reported by the Washington Post last week, was pretty telling about Meta, and social media companies generally. It states that both Facebook and Twitter, under its former management, were sensitive to claims that conservative political speech was being suppressed. “Fear of reprisal and accusations of censorship from the political right compromised policy, process, and decision-making. This was especially true at Facebook,” the document states. “In one instance, senior leadership intervened personally to prevent rightwing publishers from having their content demoted after receiving too many strikes from independent fact-checkers. “After the election, they debated whether they should change their fact-checking policy on former world leaders to accommodate President Trump.” Those “guardrails” don’t seem particularly reassuring, do they? Is AI really coming for your job? Layoffs continue to hit media and companies are looking to cut costs. So it was disheartening for new reporters in particular to learn that BuzzFeed plans to use AI such as ChatGPT “to create content instead of writers”. (Full disclosure: I worked at BuzzFeed News prior to joining the Guardian in 2019, but it’s been long enough that I am not familiar with any of its thinking about AI.) But perhaps it’s a bit too early to despair. Anyone who has used free AI to produce writing will know it’s OK but not great, so the concern about BuzzFeed dipping its toes in those waters seems to be overstated – at least for now. In an interview with Semafor, BuzzFeed tech reporter Katie Notopoulos explained that the tools aren’t intended to replace the quiz-creation work writers do now, but to create new quizzes unlike what is already around. “On the one hand,” she said, “I want to try to explain this isn’t an evil plan to replace me with AI. But on the other … maybe let Wall Street believe that for a little while.” That seems to be where AI is now: not a replacement for a skilled person, just a tool. The wider TechScape This is the first really good in-depth look at the last few months of Twitter since Elon Musk took over. Social media users are posting feelgood footage of strangers to build a following, but not every subject appreciates the clickbaity attention of these so-called #kindness videos.

Speaking of influencers, Time has a good explanation for why you might have seen people posting about mascara on TikTok in the past few days.

20,facebook,Guardian,2023-01-27,Wanda Sykes on Trump’s Facebook return: ‘Like letting Hannibal Lecter babysit your most delicious child’,"The Daily Show Wanda Sykes, the Daily Show’s guest host for the week, tore into Meta’s decision to reinstate Donald Trump to Facebook and Instagram on Thursday evening. “I mean, letting Trump back on Facebook is crazy. You’re just asking for trouble,” she said. “It’s like letting Hannibal Lecter babysit your most delicious child. “But Facebook is putting him back online anyway, because they say that ‘the public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying,’” she continued, quoting the company’s public statement on the matter. “And to that, let me say: phooey. “We all know Facebook is losing a ton of money, and they want that Trump attention back,” she explained. “They need a hit! Trump is their White Lotus. He’s the Jennifer Coolidge of the internet.” Sykes then offered an experiment to test out Trump’s return to Meta’s platforms. “I think for the first week, they should only allow him to post cat photos,” she said. “Let’s see how it goes. And if you see a bunch of cats storming the Capitol – although adorable, shut it down.” Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert also lamented Trump’s return to Facebook. “That’s a punishment for all of us,” he said. Trump’s two-year ban on Meta platforms following January 6 has now expired, and Meta determined he could be reinstated because his “risk to public safety” had “sufficiently receded”. “The risk has receded because he’s been gone!” Colbert exclaimed, comparing Meta’s logic to thinking, “you know, between knife thrusts, Jack the Ripper is a pretty chill dude”. Upon reinstatement, Trump must follow Meta’s updated community guidelines, which prohibit violence and incitement, fraud and deception, and hate speech. “So all the former president’s love languages,” Colbert quipped. In addition, Meta said since Trump already declared his candidacy for president in 2024, he’s not subject to fact-checking. “Meta! What are you thinking? You can’t allow him to post conspiracy theories on Facebook!” Colbert reacted. “That’s your mom’s friend’s job – ‘for the last time, Cathy, teenagers are not identifying as gerbils and demanding taxpayer-funded woodchips.’” Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers mocked Tucker Carlson’s latest conspiracy theory, this time on how classified documents found at Mike Pence’s Indiana residence were concocted to make Trump look bad. “Probably the craziest reaction to the Pence news has come from Fox host Tucker Carlson,” he explained, “who concocted an elaborate fantasy where the DoJ asked Pence to look for the documents, assuming he had none, in order to make Trump look bad by comparison, so that they could then prosecute Trump.” Meyers imitated Carlson’s fallacy-filled delivery: “It’s possible, in fact it’s likely, they were planning on asking Mike Pence to go undercover as Donald Trump. And if that was the plan, how would they do it? Would they have arrested Donald Trump so they could perform an experimental surgery wherein they removed Donald Trump’s face and swap it with Mike Pence just like they did to John Travolta and Nicolas Cage? “In reality, the Biden and Pence revelations show this is a lot more commonplace than most of us realized,” Meyers concluded, “and if Trump had just given the documents back when asked, there wouldn’t have been a problem.” Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel celebrated the 20th anniversary of his show, which premiered after the Super Bowl on 26 January 2003. “Why these people at ABC hired me, I still have no idea,” he joked in an emotional monologue. “I feel like at some point, ABC just forgot they were paying the show, like a 24-hour fitness membership, and it went on. “When we started, there were no iPhones, there was no YouTube, there was no Uber, no Twitter, no wifi, no Netflix, no Google,” he said. “We had Nokias and Ask Jeeves and that was it. “We’ve been through two wars, a worldwide pandemic, four presidents, one insurrection, at least three different Kanyes,” he added, displaying a Blockbuster card for the show. “If you told me we were going to last longer than Blockbuster, I would’ve sooner believed I’d be working at Blockbuster in 20 years.” Kimmel got choked up thanking his executive producers, staff, family and “everybody at ABC who didn’t fire me. “Every day it takes a lot of people to make something this dumb,” he said. “And we’ve covered a lot of dumb stuff over the past 20 years, from Snooki to Honey Boo Boo, Ken Bone to Sarah Palin, Sanjaya, Clay Aiken, chocolate rain, double rainbow, Stormy Daniels, William Hung, the astronaut diaper lady, Kim Kardashian’s sex tape, Hulk Hogan’s sex tape, Pam and Tommy’s sex tape.

21,facebook,Guardian,2023-01-27,Facebook is allowing Trump back. The platform hasn’t learned its lesson | Jan-Werner Müller,"It was left to Nick Clegg – once a great hope for liberal politics in Britain, nowadays cutting a sad figure as global lobbyist for a company with major PR problems – to announce that Facebook was open to Donald Trump’s nefarious business again. The decision was wrong, but it hardly spells the end of democracy, as alarmists equating Facebook with an inevitable triumph for fascism might think. What the decision does, though, is confirm the breathtaking hypocrisy of a corporation seemingly unable – or unwilling – to learn from its complicity in repeated political disasters. Hillary Clinton never stopped being pilloried for her “basket of deplorables” speech in 2016. However, the fact is that Trump and plenty of his supporters have said and done things which are deplorable. The really scandalous part was her casual remark that some Americans were “irredeemable”. But democracy is based on the notion that no one is irredeemable, that we should never give up on fellow citizens, hard as it may be. Those who have engaged in anti-democratic actions must have the chance to convince others that they have changed their ways. Just as it is wrong to deprive felons of voting rights for life, so is it misguided to exclude people from democratic politics forever. The Italian politician Silvio Berlusconi, after years of evading criminal punishment, was eventually sentenced to community service. He was subsequently able to return to politics, even making a bizarre debut on TikTok, where he tried hard to appear youthful and enthuse Italy’s ragazzi despite looking, after multiple facelifts, like a waxwork of himself. But Trump has neither paid any price for various offenses against democracy, nor ever shown the slightest repentance for his role in what Facebook, in its official announcement, gingerly calls “civil unrest” (as if we were talking about some general conflagration, with all sides to blame). By allowing him back on, Facebook is signaling that neither the past, nor what a perpetrator thinks about the past, matter. It pretends that, unless Trump is on the platform, citizens have no chance to find out what “the king of social media” (according to Nigel Farage) is thinking, depriving them of vital information – a patently absurd claim given that Trump remains the most public American who has ever lived. Not only that: AJ Liebling once observed that freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one – if nothing else, freedom to address the public is also guaranteed to those who own a social network. True, if Facebook executives stick to the narrowest justification for restricting speech, they can argue that Trump is not causing imminent violence. But even that is debatable. A recent post by Trump on his own platform, Truth Social, targeted two African American election workers in Georgia, Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss, whose lives had already been made hell by Trump’s team in 2020. “What will the Great State of Georgia do with the Ruby Freeman MESS?” the former president asked. Facebook points to new “guardrails” to prevent posts inciting hatred. But the corporation must know full well that far-right politicians have created a trap when it comes to content moderation: having convinced everyone that conservatives are unfairly disadvantaged by “big tech”, every sanction will be sold to outraged supporters as confirmation that the right is always the victim. If Trump stays on the platform, he wins; if he is removed again for breaking through guardrails, he also wins. And so does Facebook. For all its sanctimonious talk of “open debate” and “community”, its business model is to optimize for outrage; outrage means maximum “engagement” and hence profit. Facebook’s attempts to create less toxic politics have regularly been reversed because “engagement” appeared to have declined as a result. Its much-touted oversight board – an impressive body of former politicians, judges and academics – might criticize individual decisions, but cannot determine Facebook’s overall policy. Revealingly, the board distanced itself from the Trump decision immediately, stressing that it had not been involved; it also called for more transparency. But transparency is of course what platforms have always denied to both governments and researchers. On one level, Facebook may know that its business model is irredeemable, since it is bound to produce ever more scandals. The fact that we now call Facebook’s parent company “Meta” – leaving behind the F-word, with its bad connotations – is an extraordinary PR triumph. (Google never convinced us to say “Alphabet”, but, then again, while also engaged in comprehensive surveillance and robbing us of data, it was arguably never as evil as Facebook.) There is much generalizing about social media killing democracy. Every media revolution has created a moral panic – the printing press supposedly gave us the wars of religion; radio caused Hitler; TV enabled McCarthyism. But this technological determinism is facile; innovations have also deepened democracy. Social media and Facebook’s business model are not the same thing. The Trump decision demonstrates, though, that Facebook just cannot let go of its “incitement capitalism”. Jan-Werner Müller teaches at Princeton and is a Guardian US columnist.

22,facebook,Guardian,2023-01-26,"Trump’s return to Facebook will ‘fan the flames of hatred’, say experts and politicians","Politicians and civil rights advocates have weighed in on Meta’s decision to allow former president Donald Trump to return to Facebook and Instagram, stating that his presence on the platforms will “fan the flames of hatred and division”. The social media firm has lifted a ban imposed on Trump after the January 6 Capitol attack and will allow him to post again in the coming weeks. Experts in online hate speech say there is no reason to believe Trump will not return to spreading dangerous misinformation and hate speech upon his return. “Giving Donald Trump access to his Facebook account allows him to once again use his platform as a megaphone to spread misinformation about the integrity of our elections, incite violence and stoke the flames of white supremacy,” said Mariana Ruiz Firmat, executive director of racial justice movement Kairos Action. Democratic politicians have also spoken out against the decision, with Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, of Illinois, saying that reinstating Trump “will only fan the flames of hatred and division that led to an insurrection”. Trump was impeached for inciting the January 6 riot, a deadly attempt to overturn his defeat by Joe Biden in the 2020 election. The events also led to his being banned from a number of major social media platforms, including YouTube, Snapchat and Twitter. The Twitter ban was lifted in November, after the site was purchased by the Tesla owner, Elon Musk. Trump has not tweeted since, although he is active on his own social media platform and would-be Twitter rival Truth Social. Google, owner of YouTube, did not respond to a request for comment on whether Trump would be allowed to return, but some experts have suggested that the decisions from Meta and Twitter could set a precedent that leads other platforms to follow suit. In a blog post explaining Meta’s decision, its president of global affairs and former British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the company’s platforms should be available for “open, public and democratic debate”. “The public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying – the good, the bad and the ugly – so that they can make informed choices at the ballot box,” he said. Clegg also said that Trump would be allowed back with new “guardrails” preventing future violations of platform policies. He would, for example, be “permitted to attack the results of the 2020 election without facing consequences” but would face action if he “were to cast doubt on an upcoming election – like, the 2024 presidential race”. Many have argued that Meta’s decision is largely for financial benefit, as the company has floundered in recent months amid a declining user base and huge expenditures on its virtual reality project, the metaverse. The company lost more than $80bn in market value and laid off thousands of employees in 2022. “Meta knows the impact of bringing Trump back – the company knows he will turn Facebook and Instagram into a cesspool of hate, violence, and extremism – but it doesn’t care,” said Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters for America. “Facebook is a dying platform, and Meta will do anything to cling to relevance and revenue – even if that means endangering its users and our democracy.” Among Democrats, Adam Schiff, a former House intelligence committee chair, said Trump had “shown no remorse [or] contrition” for January 6, and Facebook had “caved, giving him a platform to do more harm”. Schakowsky added: “The reinstatement of Trump’s accounts show that there is no low [Meta chief executive] Mark Zuckerberg will not stoop to in order to reverse Meta’s cratering revenue and stagnant consumer growth, even if it means destroying our democracy.” Eric Swalwell, like Schiff now barred from the intelligence committee by Republican leaders, said: “We know that [Trump’s] words have power and they inspire, and then the leaders in the Republican party, like Speaker [Kevin] McCarthy, they don’t condemn them. And so when they’re not condemned, they’re a green light and open lane for more violence to occur.” But there was support for Meta among some civil liberties groups, who have argued that censoring him is a threat to first amendment rights. Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said: “Like it or not, President Trump is one of the country’s leading political figures and the public has a strong interest in hearing his speech. “The biggest social media companies are central actors when it comes to our collective ability to speak – and hear the speech of others – online. They should err on the side of allowing a wide range of political speech, even when it offends.” The debate over Trump’s accounts has renewed longstanding arguments that individual corporations and executives at their helm should not have such power to moderate public speech. “Meta will always prioritize its profits over the safety of Black and other marginalized communities – which is why vital communications platforms that have monumental impact on our everyday lives should not be led by private companies,” said Ruiz Firmat of Kairos. “If we want a digital realm that works for all of us, we must put governance of the internet in the hands of users.” Meanwhile, Trump used his own platform, Truth Social, to celebrate, writing: “Facebook, which has lost billions of dollars in value since ‘deplatforming’ your favorite president, me, has just announced that they are reinstating my account. Such a thing should never again happen to a sitting president, or anybody else who is not deserving of retribution!”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/26/trump-facebook-return-reaction-democrats
23,facebook,Guardian,2023-01-26,Donald Trump’s Truth Social posts bode ill for his return to Facebook,"If Donald Trump’s activity on his Truth Social account is a reliable indicator of what his return to Facebook and Instagram will unleash, then Nick Clegg is going to be busy. The former US president has used his rightwing social media platform to push baseless claims of election fraud and amplified content related to the QAnon conspiracy multiverse. These were two issues that received a special mention from Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister turned president of global affairs at Meta, Facebook and Instagram’s parent, as he explained the decision to end Trump’s two-year exile on Wednesday. Clegg, who presided over the Trump reinstatement process, said content that “deligitimises” an upcoming election or is related to QAnon could be blocked from appearing in other people’s feeds or have the reshare button removed. He said such content did not violate Meta’s community standards – or content guidelines – but could increase the risk of a repeat of the Capitol riot that got Trump banned in the first place. According to US campaign group Media Matters, nearly half of the posts on Trump’s Truth Social account in the weeks after the US midterm elections pushed election fraud claims or amplified QAnon accounts or content. If Trump continues in that vein on Facebook and Instagram, then he will immediately hit the “guardrails” that Clegg outlined in his post. Meta’s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, recently described his job as a series of body blows: “It’s almost like everyday you wake up and you’re punched in the stomach.” The reappearance of Trump will almost certainly result in further pressure on his solar plexus, judging by reaction overnight. Campaign groups warned it would be inflammatory, with the Anti-Defamation League saying Meta had chosen to “platform bigotry and divisiveness” and that the decision “isn’t a matter of free speech”. If Zuckerberg and Clegg had kept the ban in place, anger from the right of the political spectrum would have been equally loud, of course. But Clegg was clear that free speech was at the forefront of the decision, saying the public “should be able to hear what their politicians are saying” including a candidate for office such as Trump. This reflects Zuckerberg’s belief that Meta is a champion of “free expression”. Clegg reiterated that in his blogpost on Wednesday, using the opening sentence to state: “Social media is rooted in the belief that open debate and the free flow of ideas are important values.” The measures outlined by Clegg to limit the threat from content that veers towards “the risk of real-world harm” are largely already in place. These include a repeat offender policy that applies to public figures who have been banned but then allowed to return: if Trump posts further violating content it will be removed and he could be suspended for between one month and two years. The guidelines on restricting election falsehood and QAnon content are an update on the repeat offender policy. That balance between free speech and real-world harm, and the strength of that repeat offender policy, will be tested when Trump comes back. Although Trump has yet to tweet following his reinstatement to Twitter, he has made clear that he wants to get back on Facebook. In a letter to Meta this month his advisers said the ban “dramatically distorted and inhibited the public discourse” and should be rescinded. That argument about distorting and inhibiting the public realm, where everyone has a right to feel safe, would be of interest to Ruby Freeman. The former Georgia election worker was subjected to a “deluge of intimidation, harassment, and threats” and was forced to leave her home after Freeman and her daughter were falsely accused of involvement in falsifying ballots in the 2020 presidential election. In a Truth Social post this month, Trump wrote: “What will the Great State of Georgia do with the Ruby Freeman MESS? Why not just tell the TRUTH, get rid of the turmoil and guilt, and take our Country back from the evils and treachery of the Radical Left monsters who want to see America die?” Meta’s community standards on bullying and harassment prohibit “calling for, or making statements of intent to engage in, bullying and/or harassment”. If Trump repeats his Truth Social posts on Facebook and Instagram, another ban – or at least pressure to impose one – looms.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/26/donald-trump-truth-social-posts-bode-ill-return-facebook
24,facebook,Guardian,2023-01-26,Why is Trump allowed back on Facebook and will Meta’s ‘guardrails’ contain him?,"Former US president Donald Trump will have the ban on his Facebook and Instagram accounts lifted for the first time in two years, parent company Meta has announced. But what are the “guardrails” it says will deter repeat offences, what will it mean for the platform, and what would it take for him to be banned again? Why is Trump being allowed back? In short: the safety situation is not what it was on 6 January 2021, the day of the Capitol riots. Meta’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said in a blog post on Wednesday that the company had determined the risk had “sufficiently receded”, and as a result, the ban would be lifted “in the coming weeks”. However, Clegg said there would be new “guardrails” in place to deter Trump or other public figures from acting in similar ways in future. What are these ‘guardrails’? Meta has updated its policy on restricting accounts that violate the guidelines on Facebook or Instagram, with special rules for public figures during times of civil unrest. Normally people can be restricted from posting for between one and 30 days, but it can be permanent if severe enough or if it comes despite repeated warnings. But public figures will have stronger controls. This includes government officials, political candidates, and people with over a million followers. The types of violations could include inciting or celebrating ongoing violence or civil unrest. The type of violation – and the public figure’s influence over the people involved in the violence – will determine the length of the restriction, which will be between one month and two years. Meta said most violations will put a public figure in a one-month time-out from posting. A serious violation that would result in a one-year ban would be activity such as sharing a link to a statement from a terrorist group after an attack. The more severe the violence or attack, the more likely the ban will be the full two years. Other action might be more mild. Clegg said if, for instance, Trump references QAnon content, the distribution of that content would be limited, and Meta would restrict his ability to advertise. Why was Trump banned from Facebook? Trump was banned from Meta’s Facebook and Instagram platforms after the US Capitol riots on 6 January 2021. Despite the escalating violence on the day, Trump persisted in posting unsubstantiated claims that the 2020 election had been stolen, and praised the violent protesters at the attempted insurrection. In a statement posted to Facebook the next day, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, said it was clear at the time that Trump “intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power” and the risks of allowing Trump to continue to use the service “are simply too great”. A block was placed on Trump’s accounts indefinitely, but then Meta gave the final decision on whether to keep the ban in place to the Facebook Oversight board – a body designed to make final decisions on Facebook’s moderation activity at arm’s length from Meta management. The board ruled that the ban should remain in place, but said the final decision on whether Trump be readmitted should be decided by Meta. The board suggested Meta should decide within six months, but Meta opted to wait two years from the original ban on 7 January 2021. Has Trump been allowed back on any other platforms? In the aftermath of 6 January 2021, Trump was also banned from Twitter, YouTube and Snapchat. So far, only Twitter has lifted its ban. Twitter lifted its ban in November 2022, after the company’s new owner, Elon Musk, conducted a Twitter poll which elected to remove the ban by a slim majority. Trump has not tweeted since the ban was lifted. He continues to post on his own social media platform, Truth Social. Trump agreed that all posts he makes on the site will have an exclusivity period of six hours before they can be posted on other sites. But that agreement expires in June, and Rolling Stone has reported that Trump is preparing to return to Twitter as he readies his campaign for the 2024 presidential election. Trump Media and Technology Group CEO Devin Nunes has claimed, however, that Trump has “no interest” in returning to Twitter.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/26/why-is-donald-trump-being-allowed-back-on-facebook-instagram-ban-meta-guardrails
25,facebook,Guardian,2023-01-26,‘Reckless’: Fury among rights groups as Facebook lifts Trump ban,"The news that Meta will allow Donald Trump back on Facebook and Instagram following a two-year ban has been met with fury and indignation among civil rights and online safety advocates. The former US president will be allowed to return to the platforms “in coming weeks” but “with new guardrails in place to deter repeat offences”, Meta’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, wrote in a blogpost explaining the decision on Wednesday. The Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Free Press, Media Matters and other groups expressed concern about Facebook’s ability to prevent any future attacks on the democratic process or quell misinformation. “Make no mistake – by allowing Donald Trump back on its platforms, Meta is refuelling Trump’s misinformation and extremism engine,” said Angelo Carusone, president and CEO of media watchdog Media Matters for America. “When Trump is given a platform, it ratchets up the temperature on a landscape that is already simmering – one that will put us on a path to increased violence.” Trump was removed from Meta platforms after the Capitol riots on 6 January 2021, during which he posted unsubstantiated claims that the election had been stolen, praised increasingly violent protesters and condemned former vice-president Mike Pence even as the mob threatened his life. Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky said reinstating Trump’s accounts “will only fan the flames of hatred and division that led to an insurrection”. “The Capitol community is still picking up the pieces from the January 6th insurrection that Trump ignited, and now he is returning to the virtual scene of the crime,” she tweeted. In a statement explaining the decision to allow Trump to return, Clegg said: “The public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying – the good, the bad and the ugly – so that they can make informed choices at the ballot box.” “In the event that Mr Trump posts further violating content, the content will be removed and he will be suspended for between one month and two years, depending on the severity of the violation.” Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said that Trump should not be given a platform to “spread hate and incite violence”. “There is no reason to believe the former president will behave differently now that the platform has reversed his ban. This isn’t a matter of free speech; there are ample services that Trump can use to spread his message. This is a business decision to platform bigotry and divisiveness to drive clicks and engagement, plain and simple.” Free Press Co-CEO Jessica J. González, described the announcement as a “cowardly and unethical decision” that “will cause incalculable harm”. She urged Meta to reverse course and said Trump would only continue to use the company’s “powerful tools” to “spread lies and dangerous rhetoric, and incite violence targeted at disenfranchised communities and his ideological enemies”. “Meta must bear full responsibility for any harm that results from today’s extremely reckless decision,” González said. Meta initially outsourced its decision about whether to remove Trump permanently to its oversight board: a group of appointed academics and former politicians, that operate independent of Meta’s leadership to scrutinise the company’s moderation decisions. That group ruled in May 2021 that Trump’s penalties should not be “indeterminate”, but kicked the final ruling back to Meta, and played no role in his readmission to the platform. Nicolas Suzor, a professor at Queensland’s University of Technology School of Law and member of the Oversight Board, told the Guardian that the announcement “follows through on [Meta’s] commitments to us to develop clear and accountable processes in high profile cases like this”. “Many other tech companies have not done this work (or have gone backwards recently) and their senior executives still make decisions behind closed doors that impact us all.” However, a group of scholars, advocates and activists calling itself the Real Facebook Oversight Board – operating in opposition to Meta’s board – said the decision, “sends a message that there are no real consequences even for inciting insurrection and a coup.” Some free speech advocates have agreed with Clegg, saying it is appropriate for the public to have access to messaging from political candidates. Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and a former American Civil Liberties Union official, defended the reinstatement. He had previously endorsed the company’s decision to suspend Trump’s account. “This is the right call – not because the former president has any right to be on the platform but because the public has an interest in hearing directly from candidates for political office,” he said in a statement on Wednesday. “It’s better if the major social media platforms err on the side of leaving speech up, even if the speech is offensive or false, so that it can be addressed by other users and other institutions.” American Civil Liberties Union executive director Anthony Romero said Meta was making “the right call” by allowing Trump back on to the social network. “Like it or not, President Trump is one of the country’s leading political figures and the public has a strong interest in hearing his speech,” Romero said in a release. The ACLU has filed more than 400 legal actions against Trump, according to Romero. Trump has not indicated whether he will return to the platform but responded to the news with a short statement on Truth Social, saying that “such a thing should never happen again to a sitting president”.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/26/reckless-fury-among-rights-groups-as-facebook-lifts-trump-ban
26,facebook,Guardian,2023-01-26,"Trump’s Facebook and Instagram ban to be lifted, Meta announces","In a highly anticipated decision, Meta has said it will allow Donald Trump back on Facebook and Instagram following a two-year ban from the platforms over his online behavior during the 6 January insurrection. Meta will allow Trump to return “in coming weeks” but “with new guardrails in place to deter repeat offenses”, Meta’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, wrote in a blogpost explaining the decision. “Like any other Facebook or Instagram user, Mr Trump is subject to our community standards,” Clegg wrote. “In the event that Mr Trump posts further violating content, the content will be removed and he will be suspended for between one month and two years, depending on the severity of the violation.” Trump was removed from Meta platforms following the Capitol riots on 6 January 2021, during which he posted unsubstantiated claims that the election had been stolen, praised increasingly violent protesters and condemned former vice-president Mike Pence even as the mob threatened his life. Clegg said the suspension was “an extraordinary decision taken in extraordinary circumstances” and that Meta has weighed “whether there remain such extraordinary circumstances that extending the suspension beyond the original two-year period is justified”. Ultimately, the company has decided that its platforms should be available for “open, public and democratic debate” and that users “should be able to hear from a former President of the United States, and a declared candidate for that office again”, he wrote. “The public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying – the good, the bad and the ugly – so that they can make informed choices at the ballot box,” he said. While it is unclear if the former president will begin posting again on the platform, his campaign indicated he had a desire to return in a letter sent to Meta in January. “We believe that the ban on President Trump’s account on Facebook has dramatically distorted and inhibited the public discourse,” the letter said. Safety concerns and a politicized debate The move is likely to influence how other social media companies will handle the thorny balance of free speech and content moderation when it comes to world leaders and other newsworthy individuals, a debate made all the more urgent by Trump’s run for the US presidency once again. Online safety advocates have warned that Trump’s return will result in an increase of misinformation and real-life violence. Since being removed from Meta-owned platforms, the former president has continued to promote baseless conspiracy theories elsewhere, predominantly on his own network, Truth Social. While widely expected, the decision still drew sharp rebukes from civil rights advocates. “Facebook has policies but they under-enforce them,” said Laura Murphy, an attorney who led a two-year long audit of Facebook concluding in 2020. “I worry about Facebook’s capacity to understand the real world harm that Trump poses: Facebook has been too slow to act.” The Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Free Press and other groups also expressed concern on Wednesday over Facebook’s ability to prevent any future attacks on the democratic process, with Trump still repeating his false claim that he won the 2020 presidential election. “With the mass murders in Colorado or in Buffalo, you can see there is already a cauldron of extremism that is only intensified if Trump weighs in,” said Angelo Carusone, president and CEO of media watchdog Media Matters for America. “When Trump is given a platform, it ratchets up the temperature on a landscape that is already simmering – one that will put us on a path to increased violence.” After the 6 January riots, the former president was also banned from Twitter, Snapchat and YouTube. Some of those platforms have already allowed Trump to return. Twitter’s ban, while initially permanent, was later overruled by its new chief executive, Elon Musk. YouTube has not shared a timeline on a decision to allow Trump to return. Trump remains banned from Snapchat. Meta, however, dragged out its ultimate decision. In 2021, CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained in a post that Trump had been barred from the platforms for encouraging violence and that he would remain suspended until a peaceful transition of power could take place. While Zuckerberg did not initially offer a timeline on the ban, the company punted its decision about whether to remove him permanently to its oversight board: a group of appointed academics and former politicians meant to operate independently of Facebook’s corporate leadership. That group ruled in May 2021 that the penalties should not be “indeterminate”, but kicked the final ruling on Trump’s accounts back to Meta, suggesting it decide in six months – two years after the riots. The deadline was initially slated for 7 January, and reports from inside Meta suggested the company was intensely debating the decision. Clegg wrote in a 2021 blogpost that Trump’s accounts would need to be strictly monitored in the event of his return. How the ‘guardrails’ could work Announcing the decision on Wednesday, Clegg said Meta’s “guardrails” would include taking action against content that does not directly violate their community standards but “contributes to the sort of risk that materialized on January 6th, such as content that delegitimizes an upcoming election or is related to QAnon”. Meta “may limit the distribution of such posts, and for repeated instances, may temporarily restrict access to our advertising tools”, Clegg said, or “remove the re-share button” from posts. Trump responded to the news with a short statement on Truth Social, reposted by others on Twitter, saying that “such a thing should never happen again to a sitting president” but did not indicate if or when he would return to the platform. It remains to be seen if he will actually begin posting again on the platforms where his accounts have been reinstated. While he initially suggested he would be “staying on Truth [Social]”, his own social media platform, recent reports said he was eager to return to Facebook, formally appealing to Meta to reinstate his accounts. But weeks after returning to Twitter, Trump had yet to tweet again. Some have suggested the silence has been due to an exclusivity agreement he has with Truth Social. A report from Rolling Stone said Trump planned to begin tweeting again when the agreement, which requires him to post all news to the app six hours in advance of any other platform, expires in June. Trump has a far broader reach on mainstream social platforms compared with Truth Social, where he has just 5 million followers. Many online safety advocates have warned Trump’s return would be toxic, and Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill urged Meta in a December letter to uphold the ban. Representative Adam Schiff, a Democrat who previously chaired the House intelligence committee, criticized the decision to reinstate him. “Trump incited an insurrection,” Schiff wrote on Twitter. “Giving him back access to a social media platform to spread his lies and demagoguery is dangerous.” Trump’s account has remained online even after his ban, but he had been unable to publish new posts. Civil rights groups say that regardless of the former president’s future actions the Meta decision marks a dangerous precedent. “Whether he uses the platforms or not, a reinstatement by Meta sends a message that there are no real consequences even for inciting insurrection and a coup on their channels,” said a group of scholars, advocates and activists calling itself the Real Facebook Oversight Board in a statement. “Someone who has violated their terms of service repeatedly, spread disinformation on their platforms and fomented violence would be welcomed back.” Reuters contributed reporting",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/25/trump-facebook-ban-lifted-unbanned-instagram-meta-pages-latest
27,facebook,Guardian,2023-01-18,Trump pleads with Meta to restore Facebook account,"Donald Trump has petitioned Meta to restore his access to Facebook, as he reportedly looks to shift his 2024 presidential campaign into a higher gear. The former president was banned from Facebook more than two years ago, after his followers attacked the US Capitol in an unsuccessful attempt to stop certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election. In a letter to Meta obtained by NBC News on Wednesday, Trump advisers argued that the ban “dramatically distorted and inhibited the public discourse” and should be rescinded. Meta said it would “announce a decision in the coming weeks”. Their verdict stems from a self-imposed deadline: while Trump’s ban was initially indefinite, the company later pledged to revisit his accounts in January 2023, two years after the suspension began. The company has reportedly set up an internal working group, bringing together senior figures across the organization, to debate the final decision. Facebook and Twitter banned Trump a day after the January 6 attack, which has been linked to nine deaths including suicides among law enforcement. Trump used his Twitter account to encourage supporters to gather near the Capitol. In a speech before the attack, he urged supporters to “fight like hell”. He then used Twitter to criticize his vice-president, Mike Pence, for not stopping certification while the attack was in progress. A congressional committee recommended that Trump be criminally charged in connection with the attack, the fate of hundreds of his supporters. Twitter lifted its ban on Trump after Elon Musk bought the platform last year. But Trump has not tweeted since, choosing to remain on his own rival social media service, Truth Social. NBC quoted an anonymous Republican who said Trump had been bragging about eventually returning to Twitter and predicted the ex-president would do so. Trump’s accounts on Facebook and Twitter have 34 million and nearly 88 million followers respectively. On Truth Social, he has fewer than 5 million followers. Trump used Twitter and Facebook extensively when he ran for the presidency in 2016 and throughout his time in office. Impeached over the Capitol attack but acquitted, Trump announced his 2024 run in mid-November. In doing so he sought to take credit for Republicans winning back the US House in the midterm elections, though their majority was much narrower than expected and many candidates Trump endorsed suffered high-profile defeats. Trump’s ban sparked fierce debate, with Republicans deriding the move as big tech censorship, while others said it was too little too late. Experts have said that the stakes for his potential return are high, considering his extremist rhetoric and propensity for spreading misinformation have only intensified since he left office. “Trump’s behavior and language have gotten significantly worse and more extreme since he was first suspended from the Facebook platform,” said James Steyer, the founder and chief executive of online safety organization Common Sense Media. “Permitting him to return now would be a serious affront to our democracy and to Meta’s own publicly declared standards. The ban should be made permanent.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/18/trump-facebook-meta-account
28,facebook,Guardian,2023-01-18,Free the nipple: Facebook and Instagram told to overhaul ban on bare breasts,"Facebook and Instagram’s parent company could soon free the nipple. More than a decade after breastfeeding mothers first held a “nurse-in” at Facebook’s headquarters to protest against its ban on breasts, Meta’s oversight board has called for an overhaul to the company’s rules banning bare-chested images of women – but not men. In a decision dated 17 January, the oversight board – a group of academics, politicians, and journalists who advise the company on its content-moderation policies – recommended that Meta change its adult nudity and sexual activity community standard “so that it is governed by clear criteria that respect international human rights standards”. The oversight board’s ruling follows Facebook’s censorship of two posts from an account run by an American couple who are transgender and non-binary. The posts showed the couple posing topless, but with their nipples covered, with captions describing trans healthcare and raising money for top surgery. The posts were flagged by users, then reviewed and removed by an AI system. After the couple appealed the decision, Meta eventually restored the posts. The board found that “the policy is based on a binary view of gender and a distinction between male and female bodies”, which makes rules against nipple-baring “unclear” when it comes to intersex, non-binary and transgender users. It recommended that Meta “define clear, objective, rights-respecting criteria” when it comes to moderating nudity “so that all people are treated in a manner consistent with international human rights standards”. “Lactivists” spent the 2000s attempting to squash the image of breasts as inherently sexual, and the campaign to #FreetheNipple went mainstream in 2013. The phrase entered pop-feminist parlance in 2013 after Facebook took down clips from the actor/director Lina Esco’s documentary Free the Nipple. The campaign gained wide support on college campuses and was championed by celebrities including Rihanna, Miley Cyrus and Lena Dunham. As recently as last week, Florence Pugh addressed wearing a sheer, hot pink Valentino gown on the red carpet, saying: “Of course, I don’t want to offend people, but I think my point is: how can my nipples offend you that much?” In 2015, the Los Angeles-based artist Micol Hebron created stickers of male nipples – which are permitted on Instagram – so that female Instagram users could superimpose them over their own to mock the disparity. Hebron was invited to Instagram’s headquarters in 2019 with a group of influencers to talk about the company’s nipple policy. “During that meeting, we learned that there were no transgender people on the content moderation policy team, and I also observed that there were no gender-neutral bathrooms there,” Hebron said. “To me, that was all I needed to know to understand the conversation of gender and inclusivity was not being had at Meta.” A Meta representative disputed Hebron’s characterization of the event, adding: “Much has changed since 2019.” But Hebron said she was “excited” that the oversight board had taken up the issue of gender and sex-based discrimination. “Beyond just ‘let’s let women be topless’, which is not at all my interest, I think it’s really important to hold on to the goal of allowing all bodies to have autonomy,” Hebron said. “It sounds so frivolous to a lot of people to talk about nipples, but if you think about the ways that governments around the world try to control and repress female-identifying bodies, trans bodies or non-binary bodies, it’s not.” Meta “welcomes the board’s decision in this case”, a representative said in a statement that noted that the couple’s photos had been reinstated “prior to the decision”. “We are constantly evolving our policies to help make our platforms safer for everyone,” the spokesperson added. “We know more can be done to support the LGBTQ+ community, and that means working with experts and LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations on a range of issues and product improvements.” Meta has 60 days to respond publicly to the board’s recommendations. While advocates may welcome the idea of a freer nipple online, questions remain about how Meta’s automated content-moderation systems will be able to enforce a new policy on nipples. A couple fundraising to afford top surgery is not the same as someone soliciting sex online, but the company’s AI did not recognize the difference in the post at first. So how will these systems be able to tell the difference between a topless post and porn? “Context is everything, and algorithms are terrible at context,” Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism, told the Guardian. “The interesting question will be the tension over how Meta can create new rules without opening the floodgates to porn, which is why those rules exist in the first place. That ought to be possible, but I’m skeptical of whether it is if content moderation is automated.” (Bell previously held several positions at the Guardian, including non-executive director of the Scott Trust.) Facebook and Instagram users can also flag posts they believe violate the company’s policies, as they did for the photo that spurred the board’s decision. “It doesn’t take a genius to work out that there are certain areas of the culture wars where content moderation gets weaponized,” Bell said. “A post about top surgery should not have been flagged in the first place, but it was. This could have been the actions of an anti-trans bad actor.” Jillian York, an activist and director of international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, added that it was “tricky” for companies that use AI to make the right decision in every scenario. “For instance, it’s not easy for an automated technology to make a decision about who is a topless adult, versus who is a topless child,” she said. “AI may be able to make a determination between a nine-year-old and a 26-year-old, but what about a 17-year-old and an 18-year-old?” Sarah Murnen, the Samuel B Cummings II professor of psychology at Kenyon College, said the Free the Nipple movement had once centered white, cisgender women – but that was changing. “When we talked about this as an issue about cis women, it seemed less important, potentially, than it is now with trans people wanting to be open about their bodies, while anti-trans sentiment is at an all-time-high,” she said. Now, Meta has been advised to loosen the restrictive, binary way it polices bodies online. But many are quick to doubt AI’s potential to protect all users. “That’s the big lesson of all of this: when you create automated systems, you’re going to have consequences for people who are more marginalized, or the minority in society,” said Bell. “Those are the people who are penalized by the application of an algorithm.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/17/free-the-nipple-meta-facebook-instagram
29,facebook,Guardian,2023-01-16,Nepal plane crash: last moments inside cabin caught on passenger’s Facebook live video ,"In the moments before Nepal’s deadliest air crash in decades on Sunday, four friends from India who were onboard began excitedly recording the descent on a Facebook live video. They were heading to Pokhara for the trip of a lifetime, intending to visit temples and paraglide in Nepal’s famed Annapurna mountain range. “It’s really fun,” one of the men can be heard on the video surveying the city below as the plane began its descent. The friends can be heard laughing and joking as the camera is turned on a smiling Sonu Jaiswal, a 29-year-old father-of-three, who ran a small business back home in India. All appears calm in the plane, with no emergency announcements or warnings from the pilot or staff. But suddenly, the plane appears to veer off with a loud roar, and the sounds of it crashing to the ground are captured on the phone camera, before the screen is filled with flames. The burning debris of the aircraft is momentarily visible on the screen before it goes black. No voices can be heard after that. The harrowing video indicates that the 68 passengers and four staff onboard the Yeti Airlines flight had no idea the plane was in danger before an explosion just as it was landing. Vishal Koswal, 21, a close friend of the four men heard in the video, confirmed the authenticity of the video. He identified the four men, all from Ghazipur district in the state of Uttar Pradesh, as 29-year-old Jaiswal, 28-year-old Anil Rajbhar, 23-year-old Vishal Sharma and Abhishek Singh Kushwaha, 23, who had left for Nepal on 12 January. Local police also confirmed their identities. Koswal said he had meant to join his four friends on the trip to Nepal but had to stay home after a the death of a relative. During their trip, he had spoken to them many times over video call, including a couple of hours before the crash. “Sonu was showing us the mountains around on the call and was clearly excited, so were we,” said Koswal. “He told me on that call that after landing in Pokhara, they would visit some temples there and then in the evening take a train back home.” He described the four friends as like “brothers” and said everyone in the area was “very emotional”. “This all seems like a nightmare, I still cannot believe we have lost all of them,” he added. “I can’t watch that crash video again, it is very hard and painful. A big tragedy has fallen over us.” On Monday, rescuers continued the search to recover the final four bodies from the wreckage. There was no hope for survivors, said the authorities. The prime minister of Nepal declared a national day of mourning on Monday. The group of friends from India were among 15 foreign nationals who were onboard the plane. The flight was carrying 57 Nepalis, five Indians, four Russians, two South Koreans, and one person each from Argentina, Britain, Australia and France. It plunged into a gorge moments before it was due to land at Pokhara’s new international airport. It was Nepal’s worst aviation disaster since 1992, when 167 people died onboard a Pakistan International Airlines flight that crashed on approach to Kathmandu. The fire and thick smoke, as well as the treacherous terrain, made the rescue efforts by police and army officers challenging. Soldiers used ropes and stretchers to retrieve bodies from the 300-metre (1,000ft) deep ravine late into the night on Sunday. “We have so far sent 63 bodies to the hospital,” said police officer AK Chhetri on Monday. Arun Tamu, 44, who was about 500 metres away from the site where the plane crashed, told AFP news agency he was among those who ran to the site to try to help. “A few of us rushed to see if we can rescue anybody. I saw at least two women were breathing. The fire was getting very intense and it made it difficult for us to approach closer,” he said. Nepal’s air industry has boomed in recent years, carrying goods and people between hard-to-reach areas, as well as foreign trekkers and climbers. But it has also been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance. In May 2022, all 22 people onboard a plane operated by Nepali carrier Tara Air died when it crashed, and in March 2018, 51 people died when a US-Bangla Airlines plane crashed near Kathmandu. The European Union has banned all Nepal airlines from its airspace over safety concerns. • This article was updated on 19 January 2023 to record that one passenger initially listed as Irish, proved to be British.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/16/nepal-plane-crash-facebook-live-video
30,facebook,Guardian,2023-01-16,Meta’s decision on Donald Trump is looming. Will he return to Facebook?,"It’s been a little more than two years since Meta suspended Donald Trump from Facebook and Instagram over his actions during the January 6 Capitol riots. Now, a major decision looms – reinstate Trump’s account, or keep him off the platform for good? It’s a widely-watched decision that will set a new precedent for how social media firms balance free speech with content moderation, especially when it comes to world leaders and other newsworthy individuals. The announcement – expected later this month stems from a self-imposed deadline. While Trump’s ban was initially indefinite, the company later pledged to revisit whether to reinstate his accounts in January 2023, two years after the suspension began. The stakes are high, and with Trump announcing his campaign for re-election for 2024, lawmakers, activists and extremism researchers have urged Meta to keep him out. They say the former president’s propensity for misinformation and extremist thinking has only intensified since he left office, and fear he could incite further violence if he is allowed to return. “Trump’s behavior and language have gotten significantly worse and more extreme since he was first suspended from the Facebook platform,” said James Steyer, the founder and CEO of online safety organization Common Sense Media. “Permitting him to return now would be a serious affront to our democracy and to Meta’s own publicly declared standards. The ban should be made permanent.” In December, Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill urged Meta in a letter to uphold the ban, stating that Trump has continued to spread election misinformation and incite violence on his own social platform, Truth Social. “For Meta to credibly maintain a legitimate election integrity policy, it is essential that your company maintain its platform ban on former president Trump,” the letter said. “Based on Meta’s own statement on standards for allowing Trump back on the platform, his account should continue to be restricted.” The looming decision has also reinvigorated a debate that has been raging for years: how much control should private platforms have over public speech? Legislation regarding the monitoring of hate speech, misinformation and violence have long stalled, leading many to call for more action ahead of the 2024 elections. “The most critical part of this whole drama is that whole democratic societies are now routinely held hostage to a handful of individuals who have been allowed to own critical digital infrastructure – to control the communication spaces through which society now operates,” said Shoshana Zuboff, author of the Age of Surveillance Capitalism. How we got here The January 6 riots marked a breaking point in the long-standing debate over social media firms’ role in addressing hate speech and misinformation from public leaders. Many companies allowed Trump to stay on their platforms throughout his time in office despite violations of terms, citing public interest in political figureheads’ speech. But in the days after the riots, during which he posted in praise of his supporters and condemned Mike Pence even as rioters threatened the then vice-president’s life, Trump was banned from Twitter, Snapchat, YouTube and Meta platforms. The decisions heralded a political reckoning, with Republicans complaining of censorship and others saying the bans were too little too late. Twitter said its own suspension of Trump would be permanent, though the platform reversed course and reinstated his account after Elon Musk took over as CEO last year. YouTube said the ban was indefinite, and Snapchat has yet to reinstate his accounts. CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained in a 2021 post that Trump had been barred from the platforms for encouraging violence and that he would remain suspended until a peaceful transition of power could take place. “His decision to use his platform to condone rather than condemn the actions of his supporters at the Capitol building has rightly disturbed people in the US and around the world,” Zuckerberg said. Shortly after the ban, however, the company punted its decision about whether to remove him permanently to its oversight board: a group of appointed academics and former politicians meant to operate independently of Facebook’s corporate leadership. In May 2021, the board ruled that the penalties should not be “indeterminate” but kicked the final ruling on Trump’s accounts back to Meta, suggesting it decide in six months – two years after the riots. While Musk unilaterally decided to reinstate Trump after a brief poll on Twitter, Meta has offered more transparency into its decision, publishing public blog posts about the process and stating new measures will be in place to monitor Trump’s activity should he return. “When the suspension is eventually lifted, there will be a strict set of rapidly escalating sanctions that will be triggered if Mr Trump commits further violations in the future, up to and including permanent removal of his pages and accounts,” Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, wrote in a blog post in 2021. The company has set up an internal working group with employees from across the company to make the final decision, according to CNN. While it was initially slated for 7 January, that date has come and gone, leaving many to speculate on the outcome. Meta did not respond to a request for a comment regarding a timeline. What would Trump’s return mean? If Trump does return, many safety advocates acknowledge that the online landscape has changed significantly since his departure. The market is far more fragmented today, with companies such as Parler and Trump’s own social media platform Truth Social marketing themselves as censor-free alternatives for conservatives. Trump’s reach on Truth Social – where he has 5 million followers – pales in comparison to Twitter, where he had more than 88 million followers at the time of his ban. Still, the former president has pledged to prioritize his accounts there, in part due to an exclusivity agreement that requires him to post all news to the app six hours in advance of any other platform, according to a May filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nearly two months after his account was reinstated by Musk, the former president has yet to tweet, raising the question of whether he would even return to Facebook if allowed. Trump, for his part, appears to have soured on his preferred platforms of the past. In an interview with Fox News, Trump suggested he would not be tweeting again. “I am staying on Truth. I like it better, I like the way it works, I like Elon, but I’m staying on Truth,” he said. In the aftermath of his removal from Meta platforms, Trump has been highly critical of Facebook and Zuckerberg. “Sadly, Facebook has been doing very poorly since they took me off,” he wrote on Truth Social. “It has lost $750bn in value and has become very boring.” Facebook’s user base has also repeatedly declined over the past year, giving Trump – who had 34 million followers at the time of his suspension – less of an impact if he were to return. “Facebook is significantly less relevant and potent than it was in 2018 and in 2020,” said Angelo Carusone, president and CEO of media watchdog Media Matters for America. “Although the harms are not eliminated, its destructive potential is certainly weaker. It matters because it helps inform what to expect.” Despite the shift, experts say recent events have underscored that online misinformation is as dangerous as ever. Social media helped fuel attacks on government buildings in Brazil this week that mirrored the 2021 Capitol riots, highlighting concerns that not enough has changed in the last two years. “We can draw a lot of parallels between these situations, and they tie directly back to how these platforms still play a huge role in the distribution of information and incitement of violence,” said Jelani Drew-Davi, campaign director for digital social justice firm Kairos. And Trump’s own rhetoric has only gotten more extreme since his suspension from Facebook, experts say. At least 350 posts of the more than 2,000 Trump made on Truth Social between April and October 2022 would violate Facebook’s Community Standards and warrant removal, according to researchers at Accountable Tech. Those included 116 posts that endorsed QAnon, a conspiracy movement that has been linked to real-world violence and 239 posts casting doubt on US election validity. Despite the diminishing power of Facebook as a platform, a Trump return would directly contribute to the continuing mainstream acceptance of dangerous QAnon ideologies and other conspiracy theories, said Carusone. “With the mass murders in Colorado or in Buffalo, you can see there is already a cauldron of extremism that is only intensified if Trump weighs in,” he said. “When Trump is given a platform, it ratchets up the temperature on a landscape that is already simmering – one that will put us on a path to increased violence.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/15/donald-trump-meta-facebook-social-media
31,facebook,Guardian,2022-12-23,Facebook owner to settle class-action suit over Cambridge Analytica scandal,"Meta, the Facebook owner, will pay out $725m (£600m) to plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit alleging privacy violations related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the company has said in a court filing. The settlement will end a long-running dispute over the revelations that the political consultancy had accessed the data of tens of millions of Facebook users without their consent, and used it to target political adverts. “This historic settlement will provide meaningful relief to the class in this complex and novel privacy case,” the lawyers leading the case, Derek Loeser and Lesley Weaver, said. They added in a court filing that the settlement “would be the largest data privacy or data breach class action settlement ever achieved in the United States”, 10% higher again than the next largest – also awarded against Facebook, for signing up users to facial recognition services without their consent. In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said: “We pursued a settlement as it’s in the best interest of our community and shareholders. Over the last three years we revamped our approach to privacy and implemented a comprehensive privacy programme. We look forward to continuing to build services people love and trust with privacy at the forefront.” The company did not admit to wrongdoing as part of the settlement, which still needs to be approved by a judge. The case revolved around allegations that Facebook had broken state and federal laws by failing to prevent app developers harvesting user data on a widespread basis. Users were misled into believing that the company offered them control over their personal data, the lawsuit argued, when in fact “Facebook, despite its promises to restrict access, continued to allow a preferred list of app developers to access the information of users’ friends”. Facebook’s defence centred on the claim that users could not expect absolute privacy for information they had already posted on the site with the knowledge that it would be shown to their friends. As a result, the company argued, the users had suffered no “tangible” harm. That was rejected in 2019 by Judge Vince Chhabria, who said: “Facebook’s motion to dismiss is littered with assumptions about the degree to which social media users can reasonably expect their personal information and communications to remain private. Facebook’s view is so wrong. “Sharing information with your social media friends does not categorically eliminate your privacy interest in that information.” At the core of the case are the revelations around Cambridge Analytica, which harvested the data of tens of millions of Facebook users by partnering with a personality quiz operation and using the Facebook API to build extensive profiles on individuals’ behaviour and personalities. Facebook discovered the operation in 2015, but it was only revealed to the public in March 2018, when an Observer investigation uncovered the operation’s involvement in the US election.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/23/facebook-owner-to-settle-class-action-suit-over-cambridge-analytica-scandal
32,facebook,Guardian,2022-12-22,Lost and found: how a Facebook post led to the ‘chocolate chip’ toadstool,"“The cap is like a chocolate chip cookie,” says Serena Lee, senior manager at Singapore Botanic Gardens’ herbarium, describing the top of the sculptured toadstool (Amanita sculpta). “It’s big and chunky, and has a beige and dark brown cap with pileal warts.” Despite its distinctive appearance and a large fruiting body that can range from 10 to 27cm wide, the sculptured toadstool went awol in Singapore for more than 80 years. It was first collected in the 163-hectare (402-acre) Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, one of the first forest reserves to be created in Singapore, in 1939, and was described as a new species in 1962 by botanist EJH Corner, a former assistant director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The toadstool species has been recorded in other parts of Asia, including Malaysia, Thailand, China, Japan and Laos, but is thought to be rare and has been put up for assessment for the IUCN Red List. There were no sightings of the fungus in Singapore until August 2020, when a member of the public posted a photo of a curious-looking toadstool to a Facebook group about the flora of Malaysia and Singapore. “I like exploring different plants and mushrooms that I haven’t seen before,” says Serene Toh, who posted the picture. “What captured my attention in this case was the toadstool’s attractive colour and appearance.” Toh’s contribution is seen as a good example of the public assisting scientific research and knowledge, which can aid conservation projects. The photo of the peculiar fungus in its bud stage, which Toh had taken in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, was forwarded to Lee. “My colleagues from the national parks board of Singapore and I kept an eye out for the species in the nature reserve, although we were uncertain of its exact location,” Lee recalls. “Just a few days later, though … it was seen at the base of a Shorea leprosula tree, along the main road to the summit of Bukit Timah Hill. “It was a magnificent specimen,” says Lee, who identified the species. “Its cap was 27cm wide – by far the largest non-bracket type macrofungus we’ve ever seen in Singapore. Most species of macrofungi in Singapore have caps that are only 1cm to 5cm wide and barely make it past 10cm in height.” It may seem strange that such a striking and “rather huge” toadstool could exist but remain unseen for nearly a century. “Despite the large size of its fruiting body, its dark shadowy colours help it to camouflage against the background,” explains Lee. “So it’s difficult to spot it if you’re not consciously looking for it. It might simply have gone unnoticed over the years.” Since it was “rediscovered” in Singapore, the Amanita sculpta has been closely studied. “Having the material allows us to carry out genetic sequencing to develop a better understanding of the evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships with other species,” says Lee. “The rediscovery also underscores the importance of biodiversity surveys to take stock of the fungi and other flora and faunal species that can be found in Singapore. It highlights the ability of some species to persist in even a small forest fragment and underscores Singapore’s commitment to the conservation of key habitats and biodiversity.” Lee is hopeful the public’s interest in fungi will continue. “We’ve observed growing public awareness and curiosity in fungi when people go on their walks and hikes in Singapore,” she says. “By raising public awareness of such species, more people can help to look out for them and document any sightings with their phones or cameras,” she says. “Since we started studying them, rediscoveries, new records and even new genus or species have been found. For instance, in 2021, nine plant, fungal and algal species in Singapore were published as new records or rediscoveries, with more than half found in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. “That means a total of 124 new plant species, new records and rediscoveries in Singapore have been published over the past five years.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/22/lost-and-found-chocolate-chip-toadstool-amanita-sculpta-aoe
33,facebook,Guardian,2022-12-14,Meta faces $1.6bn lawsuit over Facebook posts inciting violence in Tigray war,"Meta has been accused in a lawsuit of letting posts that inflamed the war in Tigray flourish on Facebook, after an Observer investigation in February revealed repeated inaction on posts that incited violence. The lawsuit, filed in the high court of Kenya, where Meta’s sub-Saharan African operations are based, alleges that Facebook’s recommendations systems amplified hateful and violent posts in the context of the war in northern Ethiopia, which raged for two years until a ceasefire was agreed in early November. The lawsuit seeks the creation of a $1.6bn (£1.3bn) fund for victims of hate speech. One of the petitioners said his father, an Ethiopian academic, was targeted with racist messages before his murder in November 2021, and that Facebook did not remove the posts despite complaints. “If Facebook had just stopped the spread of hate and moderated posts properly, my father would still be alive,” said Abrham Meareg, who is ethnic Tigrayan and an academic like his father. “I’m taking Facebook to court so no one ever suffers as my family has again. I’m seeking justice for millions of my fellow Africans hurt by Facebook’s profiteering – and an apology for my father’s murder.” The case is asking for a compensation fund of 200bn Kenyan shillings (£1.3bn) to be established for victims of hate and violence on Facebook. In February an analysis by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) and the Observer found that Facebook was letting users post content inciting violence through hate and misinformation, despite being aware that it helped directly fuel tensions in Tigray, where thousands have died and millions been displaced since war broke out in late 2020. The research found that one post from a local influencer, calling for people to “cleanse” the area of supporters of Tigrayan forces, stayed up for four months after it was reported to the company. The family of Gebremichael Teweldemedhin, a Tigrayan jeweller abducted last December, believe that post and others like it had resulted in many attacks on Tigrayans in Gondar, a city in the Amhara region. Amnesty International is one of seven organisations supporting the lawsuit. “The spread of dangerous content on Facebook lies at the heart of Meta’s pursuit of profit, as its systems are designed to keep people engaged,” Amnesty’s deputy regional director, Flavia Mwangovya, said. “This legal action is a significant step in holding Meta to account for its harmful business model.” One of Amnesty’s own staffers, Fisseha Tekle, is a petitioner in the case. “In Ethiopia, the people rely on social media for news and information,” he said. “Because of the hate and disinformation on Facebook, human rights defenders have also become targets of threats and vitriol. I saw first hand how the dynamics on Facebook harmed my own human rights work and hope this case will redress the imbalance.” Facebook spokesperson Ben Walters told the Associated Press the company could not comment on the lawsuit because it hadn’t received it. He shared a general statement saying: “We have strict rules which outline what is and isn’t allowed on Facebook and Instagram. Hate speech and incitement to violence are against these rules and we invest heavily in teams and technology to help us find and remove this content.” Facebook continues to develop its capabilities to catch violating content in Ethiopia’s most widely spoken languages, the statement said. Facebook has repeatedly come under fire for expanding into countries with low media literacy, rapidly growing to encompass a large fraction of internet traffic in the area, and failing to devote sufficient resources to moderation in the local languages. That describes its role in Myanmar, where the site faces compensation claims worth more than £150bn after legal action was launched in the UK and US last December. Facebook admitted in 2018 that it had not done enough to prevent the incitement of violence and hate speech against the Rohingya, the Muslim minority in Myanmar. An independent report commissioned by the company found that “Facebook has become a means for those seeking to spread hate and cause harm, and posts have been linked to offline violence”. The company was also criticised by the UN for its “leading role” in the possible genocide.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/14/meta-faces-lawsuit-over-facebook-posts-inciting-violence-in-tigray-war
34,facebook,Guardian,2022-12-13,Defamation reforms: Australian media may not be liable for Facebook comments in future,"Australian media companies may avoid liability for defamatory third-party comments on their social media posts if reforms supported by the nation’s attorneys general become law. The Standing Council of Attorneys General has given in-principle support to reforms to modernise the nation’s defamation laws relating to search engines and social media platforms. In a decision that had ramifications for any Facebook page administrator, the high court said last year media companies could be held liable for allegedly defamatory comments posted to their Facebook pages. The case was sparked after Dylan Voller, whose mistreatment in the Northern Territory’s Don Dale youth detention centre led to a royal commission, sued some of Australia’s biggest media groups including the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian and Sky News over posts made by the public on their Facebook pages. The New South Wales attorney general, Mark Speakman, said the amendments, which include a new innocent dissemination defence for internet intermediaries, would substantially upgrade Australia’s uniform defamation laws. “The new innocent dissemination defence will be available to a person – other than an author, originator or poster of the matter – who provides or administers the online service by means of which the matter is published,” Speakman told Guardian Australia. “This will include an individual or organisation who uses a facility on a social media platform to create and administer a public page.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Speakman said under the new defence, a person or organisation running a Facebook page would need to receive a written complaint regarding any allegedly defamatory third-party comments before they could be held liable. “Once the forum administrator has received a complaint, they must take reasonable steps to remove or otherwise prevent access to the matter within seven days in order to rely on the defence,” he said. The changes, which would come into effect in 2024, are aimed at shielding all Facebook page administrators, not just media companies, from defamation lawsuits over posts by third parties. They would provide some relief to media companies in Australia, some of which responded by dedicating more resources for comment moderation on social media, or simply shut off their comments on some posts. In August, when releasing a discussion paper on defamation, Speakman said technology had advanced significantly since Australia’s uniform defamation laws were drafted 18 years ago. “Almost anyone can post their views on a wide range of platforms at the touch of a screen or a button,” he said. “In considering this reform, it is critical that we balance protecting free speech with the right of individuals to seek redress in appropriate circumstances for harm caused to their reputation.” The reforms are a “pragmatic approach that is intended to strike a better balance between protecting reputations and not unreasonably limiting freedom of expression in the various circumstances where third parties publish defamatory matter via internet intermediaries”, the council said in a communiqué.",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/dec/14/defamation-reforms-australian-media-may-not-be-liable-for-facebook-comments-in-future
35,facebook,Guardian,2022-12-07,‘The metaverse will be our slow death!’ Is Facebook losing its $100bn gamble on virtual reality?,"What a difference a year makes. Last October, Facebook supremo Mark Zuckerberg could barely wait to show the world what he was up to. “Today, we’re going to talk about the metaverse,” he enthused in a slick video presentation. “I want to share what we imagine is possible.” Transitioning almost seamlessly from his real self into a computer-generated avatar, Zuckerberg guided us through his vision for the virtual-reality future: playing poker in space with your buddies; sharing cool stuff; having work meetings and birthday parties with people on the other side of the world; customising your avatar (the avatars had no legs, which was weird). Zuckerberg was so all-in on the metaverse, he even rechristened his company Meta. This month, we saw a more subdued Zuckerberg on display: “I wanna say upfront that I take full responsibility for this decision,” he told employees morosely. “This was ultimately my call and it was one of the hardest calls that I’ve had to make in the 18 years of running the company.” Meta was laying off 11,000 people – 13% of its workforce. Poor third-quarter results had seen Meta’s share price drop by 25%, wiping $80bn off the company’s value. Reality Labs, Meta’s metaverse division, had lost $3.7bn in the past three months, with worse expected to come. It wasn’t all bad news, though: Zuckerberg announced last month that Meta avatars would at last be getting legs. After decades of spectacular “move fast and break things” growth, Zuckerberg’s empire is now looking a little fragile. Meta’s share price has fallen by more than 70% this year. Moneyspinners Facebook and Instagram are losing market share and Gen Z users to fresher rivals like TikTok and Snapchat. Apple’s changes to data privacy last year also decimated revenues – its introduction of an “ask not to track” option on iPhones has effectively starved Facebook of the lucrative data it uses to target ads. Meanwhile, Meta has invested a staggering $100bn on metaverse research and development to date, $15bn in the past year alone – with apparently little to show for it. Zuckerberg’s newfound metaverse obsession could be seen as a preemptive virtual land grab for what is generally agreed to be the future of the internet. It could also represent an attempted second act, for both the 38-year-old and his somewhat tarnished Facebook brand. But the markets seem to be saying “count us out”, and according to reports, just 58% of Meta’s own employees said they understood the company’s metaverse vision. Comments on the latest lay-offs in an anonymous employee survey included, “the metaverse will be our slow death” and “Mark Zuckerberg will single-handedly kill a company with the metaverse”. If nothing else, Zuckerberg has popularised the term “metaverse”, even if he didn’t invent it, and definitions of what it means vary. Zuckerberg explained it as “an embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it”. Rather than our current 2D, screen-based internet, in other words, the metaverse will be a 3D virtual space, accessed by either a VR headset or AR (augmented reality) glasses, which superimpose a layer of digital information on top of the visible world. Matthew Ball, tech investor and author of The Metaverse: How It Will Revolutionise Everything, defines the metaverse as “a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds”, with individual presence and continuity of data. He has to explain it less and less, he says: “A year ago, it was mostly ‘what is the metaverse?’ Questions now are a lot more practical: what will be here? When? For whom? How, and why?” The “why” is a particularly good question when it comes to Meta. “You’re going to be able to do almost anything you can imagine,” said Zuckerberg in his intro video last year. “Get together with friends and family, work, learn, play, shop, create …” At the time we were just coming out of the pandemic. Remote working, video calling and e-commerce had suddenly become the norm. “Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended,” Zuckerberg said in a recent staff email. “I did, too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.” Post-pandemic, it turned out people still preferred meeting face to face or on a video call to donning a clunky VR headset and dragging your legless avatar into a virtual meeting room. It has been a similar story on the leisure side. Meta’s Quest VR headsets are the market leader, but most buyers are not using them to flock to Meta’s principal app, Horizon Worlds – which the company describes as “a synchronous social network where creators can build engaging worlds”. Meta set a target of 500,000 Horizon Worlds users by the end of 2022; the current figure is nearer 200,000 – down from 300,000 in February, which suggests many first-time visitors are not returning. It has been criticised for programming bugs, instability, rudimentary graphics and a general sense of boredom. From my own visits to Horizon Worlds, the 3D motion and audio were fine but the graphics were basic, often garish and textureless: a good two decades behind today’s best video games. The feeling is of a sparsely attended trade fair. Many of Horizon Worlds’ activities felt more like demonstrations: in a perfunctory wild west town, you can shoot a virtual bottle in a virtual saloon with your virtual pistol (with unsatisfyingly lo-fi results) and ride a hobby horse (literally a virtual horse’s head on a broomstick). At the Marvel superheroes world, you can try on various costumes that enable you to fly or shoot lightning bolts, and that’s about it. There were few people in either the social “hangout” areas or the “games” section, and most of the strangers I encountered seemed to be American children. One had the avatar and voice of a 10-year-old girl. Not even the people making Horizon Worlds have embraced it. Memos leaked in October appeared to show the Meta vice-president, Vishal Shah, urging staff to use their own products more. “If we don’t love it, how can we expect our users to love it?” Shah wrote. “Everyone in this organisation should make it their mission to fall in love with Horizon Worlds. You can’t do that without using it. Get in there.” Meanwhile, direct competitors such as VRChat and Rec Room are thriving. “It’s pretty clear they are offering something that Meta doesn’t,” says veteran games designer Raph Koster, namely better avatars, a wider choices of games and, critically, bigger crowds (Rec Room has an estimated three million monthly users). “Next to those, Meta looks relatively sterile and empty. There’s just a lack of sufficient entertainment in there.” Horizon World’s numbers are dwarfed by those of online games (most of which are accessible with and without VR headsets). Fortnite attracts 250 million active players a month. Gaming platform Roblox has more 200 million visitors a month and Minecraft 170 million (two-thirds of whom are under 16 – the exact demographic that is turning away from Facebook and other social media). “Historically, we’ve seen that game worlds generally don’t have any trouble attracting an audience,” says Koster. This is not a revelation. “Bars with a jukebox or a pool table tend to do better than bars without anything. It doesn’t change because you digitise the experience.” Unlike Meta, the games industry began with the “why?” It was building complex, sophisticated, popular virtual worlds – proto-metaverses – long before the idea caught Zuckerberg’s eye. As such, it is well positioned for a slice of the metaverse pie. Epic Games, for example, whose Unreal game engine (think of it as the “brain” of the game; the software framework that builds the reality in real time) powers not only its bestselling Fortnite but hundreds of other games and applications, making it attractive to independent metaverse-builders. In April, Sony and Lego invested $2bn in Epic’s metaverse vision. In January, Microsoft moved to acquire another games giant, Activision Blizzard, makers of World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Call of Duty and Candy Crush, for nearly $70bn (the deal is currently under antitrust review). Having sprung out of social networks like Facebook, Meta’s model is based on “an attention economy, not a fulfilment economy”, says Herman Narula, head of the British tech company Improbable. Social media prioritises keeping users passively engaged for as long as possible, whereas gaming seeks to provide fulfilling, active experiences. “There’s a difference between watching an experience and having an experience,” he says. “If you look at games like Fortnite and Minecraft … what matters is presence; how many things can you do? In Minecraft, you can move anything about it, you can modify the laws, you can be creative. So what matters is creating a highly creative environment, which allows the normal self-expression.” Improbable’s website claims “we are the metaverse technology company”. Among other things (it works with military as well as gaming companies), the company, which Narula co-founded in 2012, is working on connecting various metaverses together, and hosting large numbers of people in virtual worlds. Whereas most multiplayer online games, like Fortnite, never really put more than 100 people together on one server, Improbable has hosted events bringing together 30,000 people in the same virtual space. Unsurprisingly, Narula is optimistic about the metaverse. In his recent book Virtual Society, he writes: “Like the development of writing, or the advent of the computer age, the dawn of the metaverse will be a grand pivot point in the history of humanity.” The metaverse was valued at nearly $23bn last year and is expected to grow nearly 40% a year for the rest of the decade. As the Epic co-founder and CEO Tim Sweeney put it last year: “The next three years are going to be critical for all of the metaverse-aspiring companies like Epic, Roblox, Microsoft, Facebook [Meta]. It’s kind of a race to get to a billion users. Whoever brings on a billion users first would be the presumed leader in setting the standards.” The building blocks of the metaverse are coming together, and Meta is working on many of them: hardware like VR and AR devices, data and network infrastructure, social platforms and interfaces, developer and creator ecosystems – all of which require skilled people (in Meta’s recent 11,000-person cull, Reality Labs was relatively unscathed). “We are creating a new category that requires significantly and abundantly more resources than it takes to create a single product or collection of products,” says a Meta spokesperson. “It’s misguided to categorise our long-term investment as a loss while we are within our initial phases of development.” So no more “move fast and break things”; now it’s more of a “move slowly and build things” vibe. From the outset, Zuckerberg said the metaverse would take five to 10 years to arrive, though some, such as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, are saying it is here already. Matthew Ball agrees: “We have hundreds of millions interacting in 3D virtual worlds each day,” he says, pointing to the likes of Roblox and Minecraft. But it goes beyond gaming: “Johns Hopkins University hospital is now performing surgery with XR [as in “extended reality” – VR and AR] devices and game engines, while Vancouver airport runs a 3D simulation [a “digital twin” of the airport, incorporating real-time information which can be used for training, optimisation, future planning, simulation and testing] and similarly Tesla cars are building a live simulation of San Francisco using Unreal. The pieces are more mature than many give credit, but we’ve yet to develop the standards and systems to integrate them in the ways the internet is developed today.” It is unlikely that Meta, or any other big tech company, will “own” the metaverse, says Ball. “We often misrepresent the control of big tech,” he says, pointing out that the “Big Five” – Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft – together collect less than 10% of digital revenues, “although they exert disproportionate influence over the rest of the internet … It is likely that a similar outcome happens with the metaverse: a handful of vertically and horizontally integrated software and hardware giants amass the substantial share of users, data, revenue, devices, etc, and exert even greater influence. The metaverse is likely to grow big tech’s reach, not shrink it.” If Meta does succeed in controlling a substantial slice of the metaverse, though, there are further, deeper concerns. The charge sheet against social media in general, and Facebook/Meta in particular, is extensive: disseminating and amplifying online disinformation and hate speech, unseen and undisclosed political influence, its impact on mental health, the collection and misuse of personal data. “Whatever company owns the metaverse will have better information about crime, better surveillance, better everything than the government will,” says Koster. He points out how much of our lives is already online: our personal records, our résumés, our bank accounts, our friendships, our online movements and behaviours. The metaverse will enable access to even more layers of data: “A lot of the folks who work on the hardware for AR glasses, for example, are concerned about the fact that the glasses can read biometrics off your iris, and that tells them an enormous amount about your medical state, your emotions moment to moment. Virtual worlds are panopticons. The more we digitise the world, that’s the power we’re handing over to whoever runs that metaverse.” Meta is taking pains to assuage such fears. “The metaverse is a collective project,” says a spokesperson, “and how to responsibly manage the new types of data that companies may collect is exactly the kind of challenge that needs collaboration and discussion. It’s not up to any one company to set the rules on this.” All are in agreement that regulation is needed, but judging by how well the internet has been governed so far, the outlook is complicated – potentially liberating; potentially downright dystopian.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/07/metaverse-slow-death-facebook-losing-100bn-gamble-virtual-reality-mark-zuckerberg
36,facebook,Guardian,2022-12-06,"Facebook moderation system favours ‘business partners’, says oversight board","A policy designed to protect high-profile Facebook and Instagram users from moderation was structured to satisfy their parent company’s business interests, Meta’s “supreme court” has found, and did not prioritise protecting free speech and civil rights. The oversight board, which scrutinises moderation decisions on Facebook and Instagram, said the platforms’ “cross-check” system appeared to favour “business partners” – such as users including celebrities who generate money for the company – while journalists and civil society organisations had “less clear paths” to access the programme. “While Meta told the board that cross-check aims to advance Meta’s human rights commitments, we found that the program appears more directly structured to satisfy business concerns,” said the board, adding that it had concerns about the “lack of transparency” around the programme. It said cross-check grants certain users greater protection than others because content from users on the cross-check list is allowed to stay up while it is vetted by human moderators applying the “full range” of content policies. Meta described it as a “mistake-prevention strategy” that protected important users from erroneous content takedowns. Ordinary users, by contrast, are much less likely to have their content reach reviewers who can apply the full range of Meta’s content guidelines. The board said a user’s “celebrity or follower count” should not be the sole criterion for receiving the special protection offered by the programme. Meta admitted to the board that criteria for including “business partners” on the list included the amount of revenue they generated. Meta also told the board that it exempts some content from takedowns. The company described this system as “technical corrections” and said it carried out about 1,000 a day. The board recommended that Meta conducted audits of enforcement actions that are blocked under the system. The board added that the technical corrections system is viewed as an “allow list” or “whitelist”. In September last year the Wall Street Journal, using documents disclosed by whistleblower Frances Haugen, reported that Brazilian footballer Neymar had responded to a rape accusation in 2019 by posting Facebook and Instagram videos defending himself, which included showing viewers his WhatsApp correspondence with his accuser. The clips from WhatsApp – also owned by Meta – included the accuser’s name and nude photos of her. Moderators were blocked for more than a day from removing the video, according to the WSJ, while the normal punishment of disabling his accounts was not implemented. An internal document seen by the WSJ said Neymar’s accounts were left active after “escalating the case to leadership”. Neymar denied the rape allegation and no charges were filed against the footballer. Citing the Neymar example, the board said that despite Meta saying it had a system for prioritising content decisions, some content still remained online for “significant periods” while this happened. “In the Neymar case, it is difficult to understand how non-consensual intimate imagery posted on an account with more than 100 million followers would not have risen to the front of the queue for rapid, high-level review if any system of prioritisation had been in place,” said the board. The board went on to say that the cross-check “business partner” category includes users who are likely to generate money for the company, either through formal business relationships or drawing users to Meta platforms. It said due to the “perception of censorship” it preferred keeping content up to taking it down. The board said the business partner category was likely to include major companies, political parties and campaigns, and celebrities. The board made 32 recommendations. They included: removing special protection for commercially important accounts if they break content rules frequently; prioritising moderation of posts that are important for human rights; and violating content from cross-check users that is “high severity” should be removed or hidden while reviews are taking place. The board said Meta viewed the risk of a content decision resulting in “escalation at the highest levels” to a chief executive or chief operating officer of an organisation as highly sensitive. Such content carries an “extremely high severity” tag under the cross-check system. It said Meta therefore seemed more focused on business-related consequences for its decisions rather than ones that are human rights-related. Meta’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said that in order to “fully address” the board’s recommendations, the company would respond within 90 days.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/06/meta-protecting-business-partners

The fraudsters made contact using Facebook Messenger and the identity of one of my friends, a former colleague. They persuaded me to believe that I had been a winner in a Facebook lottery. I pulled out before giving any bank or card details, but did reveal more information than I would have liked – my name, home address, date of birth, email, mobile and occupation. I am worried that the information I did provide might be used or sold on. If you have any advice on how I can take steps to limit any further damage, I would be very grateful for you to provide it. PC, by email That doesn’t sound much fun, but had you handed over your bank card details, it could have been a whole lot worse. In your shoes, I would be aiming to make sure I had two-step verification turned on for my email – if you haven’t already. If any of your passwords used your date of birth or similar, I would change them asap. In fact it is probably worth changing them anyway. Unfortunately, you have given the fraudsters enough information to enable them to pose as you to buy goods and services.

38,facebook,Guardian,2022-12-03,Facebook asked for nudes to help stop revenge porn and it worked. Can our culture change next? | Arwa Mahdawi,"Facebook’s revenge porn plan is working Would you trust Facebook with your nudes? Would you let a company famous for its somewhat loose approach to data privacy have anything to do with intimate photos of yourself? Five years ago Facebook (which is now Meta) asked Australians for nudes in a pilot effort to develop a tool to stop the non-consensual distribution of intimate images; the response was sceptical to say the least. In a surprising twist, though, it looks like Meta’s tactics to stop revenge porn are actually working. Here’s how the program, which has been developed in partnership with SWGfL, a UK-based non-profit behind the Revenge Porn Helpline, works. If you’ve shared an intimate image with someone and are worried that that person might do something nefarious with it, content moderators at Facebook can “hash” the image – essentially the picture is assigned a digital fingerprint - without it ever leaving your device. If someone then tries to upload that image to Facebook it can be quickly identified and blocked. It’s obviously not a magic bullet for stopping revenge porn, and it requires putting a lot of trust in Facebook and accepting that a random content moderator is going to be looking at your naked photos, but it gives people a little bit of control over their images. Since the program first launched in Australia, Bloomberg reports, it has helped more than 12,000 people to hash more than 40,000 photos and videos. That media is prevented from being uploaded across Meta’s social networks, Facebook and Instagram. This week TikTok and the dating app Bumble also signed up the program. “We now have four platforms [participating], but we need thousands,” SWGfL’s chief executive office told Bloomberg. “The more we can get ingesting the hashes, the more we can reduce the threat and fear victims experience.” The non-consensual distribution of intimate images is a massive and fast-growing problem. It’s most often discussed in terms of “revenge porn”, but there are multiple disgusting facets to it. “Collector culture”, for example, which is when people (usually men) pass around intimate images of women online, is an emerging trend. A senior helpline practitioner at the Revenge Porn Helpline described it as “a dystopian version of Pokémon” where “women are prizes to be passed around, shared and traded.” This sort of thing happens on multiple platforms and trying to stop it often feels like a dystopian version of Whac-a-Mole. Tech-based solutions like the program developed by Facebook are helpful, but tech alone can’t solve the problem. As Clare McGlynn, a professor of law, told the Guardian, culture change and education are hugely important. “Evidence from studies shows that just as teenage girls are pressured to send nudes, teenage boys are also feeling pressure to get nudes and share them, to gain kudos. Collecting digital trophies is becoming part of being a boy and a man – that’s what we need to change.” Google isn’t upholding its pledge to protect abortion data After Roe v Wade was overturned, Google promised that it would delete sensitive search data related to abortions: for example, searches for the location of abortion clinics. However, a new study by the tech advocacy group Accountable Tech has found Google is falling short. Some experts aren’t surprised. “Despite the promises of well-intentioned technologists, it is entirely unsurprising that new experiments are showing that sensitive information connected to abortion is being collected and retained by the advertising giant” one expert in surveillance told the Guardian. Matt Gaetz associate Joel Greenberg gets prison time for crimes including sex trafficking Greenberg’s case has had widespread attention because the former Florida tax collector is a buddy of Florida congressman Matt Gaetz and has been cooperating with the Department of Justice’s sex trafficking investigation into Gaetz. Trust in women leaders is falling New data from the Reykjavik Index for Leadership shows an alarming drop when it comes to trust in women leaders. It’s the first decline in this data-point since measurements started in 2018. Only 47% of respondents from G7 countries said they were “very comfortable” having a woman as CEO of a major company in their country, down from 54% last year. Men were a lot more likely than women to be critical of a female leader; one in 10 respondents said that they wouldn’t be comfortable with a female CEO. Responses to questions about female political leaders were along the same lines. Do we blame Liz Truss for this? Sort of. One theory for the decline in trust is more women have moved into positions of power, breeding resentment among men. When a high-profile woman fails, she’s also often held up as an example of why women shouldn’t be in leadership. Elon Musk says he will start implanting brain chips in people soon Including himself, apparently. He’s already got a chip on his shoulder, why not get a chip in his brain?

Not everyone was impressed though. “This is not a day of celebration,” bread historian Steven Kaplan told CBC. • This article was amended on 8 December 2022. An earlier version said that Meta’s and SWGfL’s new program for dealing with nudes involved sending the images to Facebook moderators. This has been corrected: the pictures are not shared and do not leave the original device – but a process called hashing creates a digital fingerprint. This blocks these images from being shared.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/03/facebook-revenge-porn-nude-images-culture-change
39,facebook,Guardian,2022-11-30,NSW high school principal investigated for historical child sexual abuse after messages found on student’s Facebook account,"A New South Wales high school principal has been banned from interacting with students while police investigate a claim of alleged historical child sexual abuse of a student when he was 17 and she was in her late 40s. Concern was raised when the student’s mother discovered hundreds of messages between the pair dating back about a decade, when he was in year 12 and she was a deputy principal. The young man died last year and his mother gained access to his social media accounts this year, discovering the communications and reporting them to police, the department of education and the minister, Sarah Mitchell. The department then took “risk management action” and removed the now principal from “all child-related duties” while the claims were interrogated. Messages seen by Guardian Australia appear to show that the teacher added the student on Facebook in April of his final year of school. Initial conversations included her messaging him to say she had marked a quiz he had taken and he had scored the top of the class, congratulating him on the result. A month later she offered to unlock the school gym whenever he wanted it, saying there is “no way u look like someone who hasn’t been able to work out much”. Within months the communications appeared to show the pair arranging to meet outside school hours, speaking about kissing and discussing that the teacher’s husband “knows about us”. It is not known whether the pair had a sexual relationship. In one message the teacher reflected that women of her age “don’t go around falling in luv with 17 yr olds”. In June that year she messaged him to say he was “very fine, very young, very bad”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup During another exchange she sent him an image that she said was “kind of relevant” with the ages of Madonna, Tina Turner, Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey alongside the ages of their respective partners with significant age gaps. “Still single? Relax, your boyfriend is not born yet,” the graphic read. In the same month, the student asked what he should call her. “I like Miss. The name Miss and you Miss,” he wrote. She replied with a smiling emoji and said “but don’t you think it makes me sound a bit paedophily [sic]”. By early July, messages hint at physical encounters. “That was not my body – that was my brain interfering,” she wrote. “I can tell you that because every time I have thought about you for the last few months, including now, my body responds ridiculously well. Just not earlier today.” He replies saying his “hips are a bit sore, knees are a bit sore. Good workout”. She asked if he had changed his mind about “this old girl” before saying she “didn’t think we were going to do that today”. She called him a “badass, cuteass” and said she had been “hanging out to get a kiss out of you today and next minute …” The teacher then insisted she would not tell anyone about what had happened. “Do you have any idea what they would think?” she asked. “My girlfriends have children older than you.” In another message, the teacher questioned “…what kind of person must I be to do what I’m doing?”. She said she would marry him “when I get out of jail for corrupting you”. When he responded saying one “can’t corrupt a badass”, she replied saying that was “not a defence I’d be able to use though”. During another conversation she relayed a dream where he picked her up and “took me out into the countryside somewhere. we just spend the whole day together, hanging out”, which she said sounded “perfect”. He replied that he also had dreams about her in which she was naked. She replied that she has those dreams as well. In mid-July, the teacher messaged the student to say her “husband knows about us and wants it to stop” and asked to pick him up so they could talk. The next day she contacted him again saying she had to “unfriend you for the moment. I love you.” Upon discovering the messages, the boy’s mother reported her concerns to police and the NSW department of education. The now principal of another high school in NSW was quickly stood down from on-campus duties and police began an investigation. The mother first contacted the department and police about five years ago, while the young man was still alive, after she was told of the alleged inappropriate relationship by another family member. She messaged her son about it but he did not respond. In documents obtained by Guardian Australia, police this year explained to the family that an anonymous report was also lodged the year after the teenager finished school and he had been spoken to at that time. He signed a statement denying anything untoward had happened. The mother was told by police that when she then came forward and wanted them to investigate a few years later, officers reviewed the claims but “given the previous signed statement … it was not looked at any further”. She told Guardian Australia she missed her “very mischievous, very outgoing, very smart” son. She wanted other parents and former students to be aware of the investigation and did not think the principal should be allowed contact with students again. A spokesperson for the education department confirmed they were “aware of this matter”. “The employee concerned is not currently working with students,” the spokesperson said. “For privacy and confidentiality reasons, we are unable to provide further comment.” A letter to the mother last month from the education minister, Sarah Mitchell, stated the department’s professional and ethical standards (PES) investigation was still open and “on hold pending advice from police about criminal charges”. “I am assured PES is in regular contact with police and is actively cooperating with, and assisting the officers involved in the matter,” Mitchell wrote. “I understand the department has taken risk management action in the matter, in that the principal has been removed from all child-related duties. “Please be assured the safety, welfare and wellbeing of children is the department’s paramount concern and appropriate action will be taken as soon as possible once the issue of criminal charges is resolved.” A NSW police spokesperson told Guardian Australia that police had “received a report of alleged historic child sexual abuse. Inquiries are being conducted by [district police], in partnership with the State Crime Command’s Child Abuse Squad.” The principal has been contacted for comment. • In Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact the Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800, or Bravehearts on 1800 272 831, and adult survivors can contact Blue Knot Foundation on 1300 657 380.

40,facebook,Guardian,2022-11-21,Facebook sued for collecting personal data to target adverts,"A human rights campaigner is suing Facebook’s owner in the high court, claiming the company is disregarding her right to object against the collection of her personal data. Tanya O’Carroll has launched a lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta alleging it has breached UK data laws by failing to respect her right to demand Facebook stop collecting and processing her data. Facebook generates revenue from building profiles of users and matching them with advertisers who direct ads at people targeting their specific interests and backgrounds. O’Carroll told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “This case is really about us all being able to connect with social media on our own terms, and without having to essentially accept that we should be subjected to hugely invasive tracking surveillance profiling just to be able to access social media.” O’Carroll, a senior fellow at Foxglove, a UK legal campaign group that focuses on accountability in the technology industry, is claiming that Facebook has breached article 21 (2) of UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which gives individuals the right to protest against the processing of their personal data for marketing purposes. O’Carroll said a successful case could set a precedent for millions of Facebook, social media and search engine users. “With this case, I’m really using this right that’s long been there on the law books, but has been up until now not been exercised, which is to simply say ‘I object’, and if we are successful in that then everybody will have that right,” she told the BBC. O’Carroll has lodged a claim in the high court and is awaiting Meta’s acknowledgment of the claim and confirmation that the company intends to defend it, followed by a hearing and court judgment. O’Carroll is not seeking damages but a yes/no decision on whether she can opt out of being profiled for advertising purposes. A Meta spokesperson said: “We know that privacy is important to our users and we take this seriously. That’s why we build tools like privacy check-up and ads preferences, where we explain what data people have shared and show how they can exercise control over the type of ads they see.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/21/woman-launches-high-court-challenge-of-facebook-use-of-personal-data-for-ads
41,facebook,Guardian,2022-11-19,"Victorian Labor loses ‘Matthew Guy’ Facebook page after using it for $115,000 worth of attack ads","The Victorian Labor party spent more than $115,000 on a Facebook page under the name of the Liberal leader, Matthew Guy, to boost paid ads attacking his policies and record in government, before deleting the page just a week out from election day. The circumstances behind the deletion of the page – which was the second-biggest political advertiser on all of Australian Facebook in the past month – are unclear. But it was just part of Labor’s social media campaign, which is vastly larger and more sophisticated than of its Liberal opponents. The government has outspent the opposition by up to three times, and is running far more highly targeted ads on the platform. “Every advertising dollar that’s been spent has been thought out, intentional and considered,” a Labor campaign headquarters insider told Guardian Australia. Labor has branded Guy “the Liberal cuts guy” in much of its advertising, criticising opposition election policies and decisions he made in government. A website expanding on those messages, thecutsguy.com, carries only a small Labor authorisation message. An accompanying Facebook page, titled Matthew Guy – The Liberal Cuts Guy, began posting ads on 31 October. By 15 November the page had spent $115,893 to boost 1,146 ads, according to Facebook ad library data that showed they were paid for by Victorian Labor. The page itself, as well as its ads, also carried authorisation messages on behalf of Victorian Labor. The page boosted 19 types of ads, all critical of Guy personally. “The Liberals sacked Matthew Guy after he lost the last election. Now he’s back and so are his plans for cuts,” read one ad, with a link to the “Cuts Guy” website. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In the past 30 days on Facebook, only one political advertiser in the country spent more money on political ads than the page. That was Victorian Labor’s main page, with $237,055 spent. All in all, taking in ads from the page of the premier, Daniel Andrews, Labor has spent at least $393,849 in a month. That compares to about $118,000 spent in ads from the Liberal’s main page ($72,000) and Guy’s official Facebook page ($46,335) in the same period. But by Thursday the “Cuts Guy” page disappeared. Facebook’s ad library reported the page “has been unpublished or deleted”. Guardian Australia asked the Victorian Labor party if it had voluntarily removed the page, or if it had been deleted by Facebook. No response was received by publication time. Facebook, the Victorian Electoral Commission and the Victorian Liberals were also contacted for comment. Daniel Andrews himself is arguably the most successful social media user in Australian politics, with 1 million followers on Facebook – outnumbering the prime minister, Anthony Albanese (324,000), and his predecessor, Scott Morrison (781,000), as well as his counterparts in NSW (38,000) and Queensland (342,000). Andrews’ success in building an online following is attributed to him being an early adopter of social media. His director of media, Sabina Husic, is credited with driving his successful following during his first term in office, creating shareable content linked to pop-culture and trending joke formats, and establishing a clear voice and personal narrative. The cadence to his posts during the pandemic led to an entire Facebook group dedicated to mimicking his updates. The premier has also been known to bypass media – including its scrutiny – in favour of making announcements on social media. The multibillion-dollar, 90km underground Suburban Rail Loop was unveiled on Facebook via a slick promotional video with a dramatic soundtrack. The usual unit of four people in the premier’s team who work on his social media had grown during the election, a Labor HQ insider said, though they wouldn’t reveal by how many. They said the campaign’s media focus had largely been on TV, social and online media, rather than “traditional media” such as newspapers and radio, where Andrews has had a long-running feud with 3AW host Neil Mitchell and News Corp’s Herald Sun.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/20/victorian-labor-loses-matthew-guy-facebook-page-after-using-it-for-115000-worth-of-attack-ads
42,facebook,Guardian,2022-11-17,Mother of Aboriginal man injured in apparent vigilante attack condemns Facebook abuse,"A Noongar woman whose teenage son was seriously injured in an apparent vigilante attack says she has been threatened and abused online, but has urged supporters not to retaliate. Kathy Penny’s 18-year-old son, Ronaldo, was left in a critical condition when a 49-year-old woman chased him and his friend through Perth’s northern suburbs after it was alleged they had stolen a motorcycle. The woman has pleaded guilty to charges of driving dangerously and causing aggravated grievous bodily harm. “He was in a coma for six days, with swelling on the brain and bleeding, with a fractured skull and broken femur,” Penny said. “His injuries are still going to be there permanently, he’s going to be limited for the rest of his life.” Ronaldo has been charged with a number of offences including aggravated burglary and stealing offences. He appeared in court last month and has been remanded to Hakea prison. His 17-year-old friend has also been charged in relation to the incident. Penny said the abuse on social media was “just hatred and revenge”. “They’re just saying really nasty things. Like he should have died, it was good what happened to him, he deserved it. “Facebook and the social media companies need to put a stop to that … There’s over 200 comments. They shouldn’t be allowed to say those kinds of things about somebody else’s son.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Last week Guardian Australia reported that a WA community Facebook group with tens of thousands of members had hosted threatening comments that Aboriginal people in Perth said fostered a climate in which vigilante violence was accepted. Facebook’s parent company, Meta, said in a statement none of the comments highlighted in the report would be removed. “We reviewed the content links shared across and they did not breach our community standards,” the statement said. Penny said no one should break the law, including her son and his friend, but the same applied to the woman who chased them. “It’s against the law,” Penny said. “Two wrongs don’t make a right, but she did not have the right to do what she did.” Penny said she had forgiven the woman and would not respond to online threats or remarks in support of vigilantism. “If we retaliated, three wrongs wouldn’t make a right, so we just have to wait and hopefully justice will prevail. I forgive her but I can’t forget what happened.” The incident prompted WA’s police commissioner, Col Blanch, to warn people against taking matters into their own hands. “We’ve seen it many, many times, people taking chase of offenders when they’ve witnessed a crime,” Blanch was quoted as saying in WA Today. “It can end in tragedy for yourself, other members of the community or the person that you might be chasing.” Perth parents say hostility and violence towards young Aboriginal people accused of being involved in crime is being fuelled by racist comments in Facebook community groups. Verna Anderson, one of Penny’s daughters, said Aboriginal children, including her 14-year-old brother, had been chased and threatened while simply walking the suburban streets. “This was just a couple of days ago ... When a white van started following them and came to the park with them. So they all started hiding behind bushes and he got out of the car and he started shouting out at them,” she said. She believed attacks and anti-social behaviour were becoming more common in Perth’s suburbs. “It’s becoming an everyday thing, even I have been chased and harassed.” She said people on social media were becoming emboldened to suspect young people of criminal activities without any evidence. “I think they think that no one’s going to do anything. They’re just going to get away with it. Because we’re Black,” Anderson said. Concerns were raised recently at a meeting between Aboriginal community elders and Blanch and other senior officers. Donna Nelson, who works with children and runs a community basketball program, said young people and their families were afraid. “The community is feeling unsafe. Parents are certainly feeling unsafe. Aboriginal people are becoming very concerned about what potentially this could lead to if appropriate action isn’t taken. “People are more worried about their property. I’m not saying that we condone wrongdoing in any way. But it is about people taking it in their own hands as opposed to following what should be proper protocols. “Respect is just not being given to our kids and violence is constantly perpetrated on our children.”",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/18/mother-of-aboriginal-man-injured-in-apparent-vigilante-attack-condemns-facebook-abuse
43,facebook,Guardian,2022-11-15,Queensland watch house whistleblower labelled ‘dog’ in Facebook group for police,"A Queensland police whistleblower who leaked audio recordings of officers using racist and violent language has been called a “rat” and a “dog” in a private Facebook group for police officers. The QPS has apologised for the “sickening and disturbing” Brisbane city watch house recordings – which included comments that black people should be beaten and buried – and said the incidents are being investigated. The police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, said on Tuesday that the actions of the whistleblower, Steven Marshall, were “excellent” and encouraged officers to come forwards with complaints. Marshall says he made the decision to release the recordings to the Guardian, which were published Sunday, after previous attempts to raise separate matters of concern via internal QPS processes resulted in little formal action, while he says he suffered alleged reprisals from colleagues. He says he did complain internally about one of the recordings, as well as submitting all of them to the state commission of inquiry into police responses to domestic and family violence. The inquiry heard several alleged instances where whistleblowers suffered adverse consequences for making a complaint, including officers who said they had been labelled a “dog” by colleagues. Guardian Australia has seen screenshots of a discussion about the watch house recordings in a private Facebook group for law enforcement officers. Current and former Queensland police officers appear to be involved in the conversation, which includes attacks on Marshall and comments that the recordings are not problematic. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Who is the fuckin Rat taping the crew[?]” one man posted. The comment was liked by accounts that appear to be Queensland-based police officers. Another comment, from a person who appears to be a former Queensland officer, says: “I believe it was a recording from the watch house counter some DOG has made a complaint”. Other posts, which are liked by serving and former officers, suggest the recordings are just officers being “human”. “Nothing to see here. Boring edited voice recordings of police who put up with shift after shift of shit. If the general public only knew how bad it was out there, they would and should be afraid. “Police are human and should be able to talk freely within their own stations. After all that is supposed to be their safe place. What a farce.” A Queensland-based poster said: “Well some people just won’t be happy til (sic) the police is full of fluffy numpties who are too scared to do or say anything.” Another, also from Queensland, said: “Were the media feigning outrage to stir up the feral police-haters? I didn’t hear anything offensive on that tape?” The recordings include officers at the Brisbane city watch house joking about beating and burying black people, complaining “you’ve got to be embarrassed about being white” and raising fears that Australia “will be fucking taken over”. The tapes include an officer referring to Nigerians as “jigaboos”. Officers heard in the recordings have not been stood down or identified by police, Carroll confirmed on Tuesday. Emails seen by the Guardian confirm Marshall complained internally about the officer who used the term “jigaboos” and that he previously was dealt with by “local management resolution” – a remedial discussion with a senior officer – and sent back to work. Marshall says he spoke with the officer in charge of the state’s watch houses, deputy commissioner Mark Wheeler, last month, though he did not share the recordings at the time. He said he raised his concerns, including about racism and sought help finding a job with a different agency due to ongoing reprisals. He says the request was refused. When asked by journalists about that conversation on Tuesday, Wheeler said he spoke to Marshall for a considerable period of time and had followed proper process. “I was certainly not aware of those recordings at that point in time. Not aware at all,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/16/queensland-watch-house-whistleblower-labelled-dog-in-facebook-group-for-police
0,snapchat,news.com.au,2023-05-01,Australian Government announces crackdown on illegal black market vapes,"Australia is set to ban the importation of most vapes, introduce plain packaging and strip them from convenience store shelves under world-first reforms.
The biggest crackdown on e-cigarettes in Australian history is set to be unveiled in the May budget amid fears vaping has emerged as a serious behavioural crisis in schools across the nation.
Under current laws vapes with nicotine can only be bought with a prescription from a chemist. 
But that hasn’t stopped thousands of convenience stores and online providers selling to kids.
Health Minister Mark Butler will unveil the changes on Tuesday under a crackdown that will also involve the states and territories moving to stamp out the growing black market in illegal vaping.
The changes will include tough new laws to:
- Stop the import of non-prescription vapes
- Increase the minimum quality standards for vapes including by restricting flavours, colours, and other ingredients;
- Require pharmaceutical-like packaging;
- Reduce the allowed nicotine concentrations and volumes; and
- Ban all single use, disposable vapes.
But the reforms won’t stop there, with the Albanese Government preparing to work with states and territories to close down the sale of vapes in retail settings, ending vape sales in convenience stores and other retail settings.
Health experts fear the rise of vapes poses a public health crisis with children who vape three times as likely to take up smoking.
Experts claim thousands of children can no longer sit still in class because they are addicted to vaping after smoking “bubblegum” flavours that secretly contain nicotine.
Health Minister Mark Butler said it was clear that governments had to act.
“Vaping was sold to governments and communities around the world as a therapeutic product to help long-term smokers quit,‘’ he said.
“It was not sold as a recreational product - especially not one for our kids. But that is what it has become: the biggest loophole in Australian history.
“One in six teenagers aged 14-17 has vaped. One in four people aged 18-24 has vaped. By contrast, only one in 70 people my age has vaped.
“And when more than a thousand teenagers aged 15 to 17 were asked where they could get vapes, four out of five of them said they found it easy or somewhat easy to buy them in retail stores.
“This is a product targeted at our kids, sold alongside lollies and chocolate bars.”
Mr Butler said schools were now struggling to deal with the fallout.
“Vaping has become the number one behavioural issue in high schools. And it’s becoming widespread in primary schools,” he said.
“Over the past 12 months, Victoria’s poisons hotline has taken 50 calls about children under 4 becoming sick from ingesting or using a vape.
“Under the age of 4! Vapes contain 200 toxic chemicals that do not belong in the lungs, the same chemicals you’ll find in nail polish remover and weed killer.
“Just like they did with smoking, Big Tobacco has taken another addictive product, wrapped it in shiny packaging and added flavours to create a new generation of nicotine addicts.
 “Vapers are three times as likely to take up smoking, which explains why under 25s are the only cohort in the community currently recording an increase in smoking rates.
“This must end.”
Vape police could be rolled out to monitor the sale of e-cigarettes to children across Australia including on TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram under a plan that will ban most imports and introduce plain packaging.
VicHealth CEO Sandro Demaio, a globally-renowned public health expert and medical doctor, told news.com.au that as soon as the Albanese Government introduced new import bans enforcement could be much tougher at a state level.
“In many ways this explosion of vaping has really come out of nowhere over just a couple of years,’’ he said.
“But the reverse is also possible if we ban the advertising of vapes and actually clamp down on the use of social media to promote these products.
“If we make them less alluring, so they don’t they don’t come in Froot Loops flavour and look like a highlighter. They don’t have unicorns on the side. That will make them far less appealing.
“And basically cut off the tap at the border. Those things will absolutely make a huge difference.”
Dr Demaio said that introducing plain packaging was important because that would then allow enforcement to swing into action.
“Obviously, we want to close the access and the huge amount of vapes that have been finding their way into the hands of particularly young people,’’ he said.
“So what needs to happen at the state level is that there needs to be a licensing scheme in every state.
“The licences themselves would create revenue, which can support enforcement officers, so we’re not relying on police to enforce the measures that we currently have.
“In theory, they’re not currently subject to the laws because they don’t contain nicotine. But the vast majority do contain nicotine; they’re just simply not putting in all the packets.
“And really, what needs to be done is to say, ‘Well, if there’s no flavours, no colours and the only pathway through a prescription, and they, they, they have pharmaceutical packaging, it then makes it much easier for the states to actually enforce it.”
He warned children were being “viciously” exploited.
“Well, what’s happened over the last few years is that the tobacco industry and the e-cigarette industry, of which there’s huge overlap, has seen an opportunity to, you know, get another entire generation of Australians addicted to nicotine with a new product. That’s flown under the radar,’’ he said.
“This industry has used young people’s social media. These things are all over social media. You can jump on Tik Tok and there are ads for E cigarettes with a ‘Buy Now’ button.
“Social media is under-regulated in this country. They have flooded the market with really cheap imports from overseas that don’t declare that they contain nicotine.
“And it’s been a combination of social media, weaponising their data on social media and flooding the market with really cheap and highly addictive imports.”",https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/australian-government-announces-crackdown-on-illegal-black-market-vapes/news-story/9771ff97a465a95b49945da68b61fb00
0,snapchat,Guardian,2023-04-19,Snapchat making AI chatbot similar to ChatGPT available to every user,"Snapchat is releasing its GPT-powered AI chatbot to every user for free, the company announced at its annual developer conference, as it tries to chart a distinctive path between the titans of Instagram and TikTok. That means expanding access to its AI chatbot, doubling down on the distinction between public and private posts, and paying successful creators a share of the revenue their viral content generates. First released for paying members of the social network’s Snapchat+ subscription service, “My AI” shows up as another chat contact in the social network’s app. Similar to ChatGPT, users can ask it factual questions, request creative content, and have back-and-forth conversations with the service. “It really deepens our ability to serve our mission of helping people express themselves, learn about the world, live in the moment and have fun together,” said Snap’s vice president of product, Jack Brody. Users will also be able to add My AI to group chats, turning to the virtual assistant for any queries that come up in the course of conversation. Paying users will also be able to send photos to their AI helpers and receive completely AI-generated images in return, Brody said. “The idea is you snap My AI and it can snap you back,” he added. “In the early days, most of the experiences are really just fun and playful, and exciting to experiment with. There’s certainly opportunities to make that a useful feature as well: one of the things that’s been fun is snapping it some ingredients and it can send you back a recipe.” My AI was criticised for being inappropriate for the company’s young users when it was originally released in March. In tests run by the Washington Post, the bot cheerily gave advice to a reporter claiming to be 12 years old about how to plan a “surprise trip” with their “30-year-old boyfriend” where they intended to have sex for the first time. Now that the paid trial period is over, Brody says, the app will be more careful about providing age-appropriate advice. “This early phase of the rollout has allowed us to address some of the challenges that have come up, like adding age awareness. In 99.5% of cases, its responses do conform to our community guidelines.” Snapchat is also introducing new tools for creators who want to use the platform to go viral. In contrast to bigger rivals like TikTok and Instagram, Snapchat’s focus is on private communication rather than public broadcast, Brody said, but new tools will allow creators to split the difference, running a public page at the same time as posting privately for friends and family. “A lot of other platforms really breed this pressure to to be perfect, and we’ve seen that that can lead to creator burnout,” he added. “What we hear back from them is that Snapchat is a place where they feel like they can be themselves, where they can post without worrying so much about making sure it’s perfect or perfectly edited.” Almost three years after the company launched its TikTok-style Spotlight feed, alongside a $1m daily prize fund for the most-viewed videos, Snapchat is also doubling down on paying creators for their viral success. Eligible users will need at least 50,000 followers on the app, with 25m views and at least 10 public posts a month, but if they do, the company says it’s committed to helping them build a business and grow their audience – not rely on off-platform opportunities to earn money from their fame.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/19/snapchat-making-ai-chatbot-similar-to-chatgpt-available-to-every-user
1,snapchat,Guardian,2023-02-28,‘Professional adverts’ for county lines ensnaring children on Instagram and Snapchat ,"County lines adverts on Instagram and Snapchat designed to groom children and young people now resemble professional job adverts, a parliamentary committee heard on Tuesday. Experts from charities gave evidence to Tuesday’s cross-party education committee about the constantly evolving scene, with traffickers frequently changing their methods of ensnaring children and young people. Johnny Bolderson, manager at the organisation Catch 22, which helps to support and rescue children and young people groomed into county lines exploitation, told the committee that children as young as seven were now getting involved in drug running. He said: “Social media platforms need to take more responsibility. Adverts on Instagram and Snapchat for young people to get involved in county lines look professionally done – ‘recruitment opportunities available’. That has been growing in the last six months. Since Covid, families are struggling, and with really professional advertising young people think they are going to help out their families.” The committee heard that London, West Midlands, Manchester and Merseyside were four of the main areas for county lines activity, and that thousands of children and young people were getting pulled in every year. Rebecca Griffiths, head of the National Counter-Trafficking Service at Barnardo’s, said that the charity had received 300 referrals from various parts of England and Wales in the past three months. “Vulnerability is changing all the time. We are seeing much younger children and the modus operandi of traffickers is changing. They are targeting more affluent children. Every child can be exploited criminally,” she said. Some girls have been forced to take on “debts” for their boyfriends they are expected to repay. Children can be given free vapes along with bicycles, sweets, magazines or even free sandwiches to entice them to get involved with county lines groomers. Iryna Pona, policy and impact manager at the Children’s Society, said: “Vaping is a way of grooming.” According to Bolderson, children can also be reeled in through online gaming platforms where groomers befriend them in internet gaming chatrooms, give them coins to enable them to play more games. The children then owe a debt and find themselves in ‘debt bondage’ to the groomers. He said children could be groomed without leaving their bedrooms. Susannah Drury, director of policy and development at the charity Missing People, told the committee that it was partly a public health issue, with a cross-government approach required and children benefiting from early intervention. Of the county lines traffickers’ approach, she said: “This is a business model that’s very fluid, very reactive, very agile.” The National Crime Agency has called county lines exploitation “the most frequently identified form of coerced criminality, with children representing the vast majority of victims”. The Home Office’s 2020 Drugs Review by Dame Carol Black found strong associations between young people being drawn into county lines and increases in child poverty, the numbers of children in care and school exclusions.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/28/county-lines-grooming-looks-like-professional-job-ads-on-social-media

The 46-year-old chef and judge died in Melbourne on Sunday, just a day before the latest edition of the cooking show was set to premiere on Channel 10.
“The time has come for @masterchefau to kick off a new season filled with Secrets & Surprises! And @jamieoliver of course!” he wrote. 
Network 10 and his family made the announcement in a statement, alongside declaring that the show would be postponed for a week due to his sudden death.
“With completely shattered hearts and without knowing how we can possibly move through life without him, we are devastated to share that Jock passed away yesterday,” Jock’s family said in a statement on Monday.
“So many words can describe him, so many stories can be told, but at this time we’re too overwhelmed to put them into words.
“For those who crossed his path, became his mate, or were lucky enough to be his family, keep this proud Scot in your hearts when you have your next whisky.
“We implore you to please let us grieve privately as we find a way to navigate through this and find space on the other side to celebrate our irreplaceable husband, father, brother, son and friend.”
Mr Zonfrillo is survived by his wife Lauren Fried and his four children Ava, Sophie, Alfie and Isla.
Network 10 also shared a statement.
“Network 10 and Endemol Shine Australia are deeply shocked and saddened at the sudden loss of Jock Zonfrillo, a beloved member of the MasterChef Australia family. Jock passed away in Melbourne yesterday,” the network said.
“Jock was known to Australians as a chef, best-selling author, philanthropist and MasterChef judge but he will be best remembered as a loving father, husband, brother and son.”

Restaurant Oranaa was named as Restaurant of the Year by Gourmet Traveller in 2018 and by the Good Food Guide in 2019.
He initially worked under renowned Michelin-starred chef Marco Pierre White.
“Zonfrillo climbed his way to the top of the gastronomic ladder only to abdicate his position. He still inspires chefs worldwide,” Mr Pierre White said about Mr Zonfrillo in 2022.
Mr Zonfrillo grew up in Glasgow to an Italian father and Scottish mother.

The 55-year-old confirmed the exciting news via Instagram on Saturday with two loved-up photos of the pair cuddled up close to each other.
“A thousand times …. YES @dominicpurcell,” she captioned her post.
She and Purcell, 53, debuted their romance and went Instagram-official in November 2022, Page Six reports.
Since then, they haven’t been shy about showcasing their love in public and on social media.
“Headed into the New Year HAPPY @dominicpurcell,” Tish captioned a sweet Instagram post last December. “Wishing everyone a safe and magical New Year’s Eve!”
Born in Britain, Purcell moved with his family to Australia at the age of two and started his acting career here in shows like Home And Away, Raw FM and Heartbreak High. 
Reports surfaced earlier this year that Tish and Purcell were getting serious quickly.
“Things couldn’t be going better for Tish and Dominic,” a source told Us Weekly in February. “[Tish] truly feels like she found her soulmate.”
News of her romance with Purcell came shortly after her ex-husband, Billy Ray Cyrus, officially moved on with Australian singer Firerose.
The couple – who first sparked engagement rumours in September 2022 – confirmed they were engaged last November.
However, Billy Ray, 61, did not give Firerose (real name, Johanna Rosie Hodges) a ring or a formal proposal.
“Billy looked at me and said, ‘Do you, do you wanna marry me?’” the singer recalled to People at the time. “He said, ‘I love you. I wanna make this official. I wanna be with you forever.’”
As previously reported, Tish filed for divorce from the Achy Breaky Heart singer for a third time in April 2022 after 28 years of marriage.
In addition to 30-year-old Miley, Tish and Billy have two other children together: Braison, 28, and Noah, 23. Tish is also the mother of Brandi, 35, and Trace, 34.
As for Purcell, he has four kids – Joseph, 23, Audrey, 22, and 19-year-old twins Lily-Rose and Augustus – with ex-wife film producer Rebecca Williamson.

2,instagram,news.com.au,2023-05-08,Azealia Banks rips into Australia,"Azealia Banks has taken a swipe at Australia’s music and entertainment industry, calling it “trash”, while also labelling Australian artists as “untalented/uncultured and unneeded”.
The American rapper took to Instagram on Monday where she shared several posts ranting about Australia’s music industry. 
“Realise musical talent is just not in the gene pool,” she wrote.
“Absolutely no one on earth takes (the Australian music industry) seriously.”
Lamenting at the seemingly endless reserve of talentless Australian performers, Ms Banks’ passionate posts made exceptions for Kylie Minogue, INXS and AC/DC, but called Tame Impala “cheesy” and Wolfmother “an American rock tribute band”. 
No stranger to publicly voicing her grievances with the country and its music scene, the most recent controversy seemingly arose over allegations an Australian record label “corruptly stole” Ms Banks’ intellectual property. 
The singer/rapper/songwriter took to Instagram shortly after reading a piece in The Guardian written by Ben Eltham, who spoke to the hurdles faced by local artists in reaching new audiences in the age of social media. 
Ms Banks said Australian Dance Music record label Sweat It Out incorrectly labelled the genre of her music, implying she was in a vulnerable position when signing the record deal as she was “very f*cking sick” at the time. 
Citing “jealousy, racism and desperation” as the driving force behind Sweat It Out’s “piss poor remix” of her new song, ‘New Bottega’, Ms Banks widened her criticism to capture the entire Australian music industry. 
“(It) is a hip hop record. It is not a dance record,” she said. 
“Clearly there is a cultural dissonance here.
“HipHop is the most profitable genre of music in the world right now. EDM (electronic dance music) is f*cking dead.”
Ms Banks went on to say that Australia’s entertainment industry failed to “realise how unimportant they are as far as music culture goes”. 
“Australia’s media/music/entertainment industry isn’t exactly heralded by the heads of government or anyone in the world as a coveted cultural export,” she said. 
“Australians don’t even want to hear Australian music LOL.”
Ms Banks cited Australia’s enduring colonial apparatus and its systemic dispossession of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the driving force behind its music and culture being “so trash”. 
“Y’all stomped all the blackness out of Australia – which is why your music exports suck,” she said. 
“(It’s) one of the most culturally stale white nations on the planet.” 
Her posts comes nearly six months after Ms Banks cancelled an Australian show in 2022 and vowed never to return to the nation’s shores.
Lashing out at event promoters over allegations that they failed to pay her, Ms Banks also took aim at Australian currency, calling it “third-world”. 
The performer also cited a “racist” incident that occurred during her Sydney show in which a bottle of soft drink was thrown at her on stage, subsequently promising she would not return to the land down under.

3,instagram,news.com.au,2023-05-03,Jock Zonfrillo was found by police at Lygon Street’s Zagame’s House,"Celebrity chef Jock Zonfrillo was found dead inside a Melbourne hotel just metres away from the home his family had recently moved out of to make a fresh start overseas.
Zonfrillo, 46, was found dead by police about 2am on Monday following a welfare check at boutique hotel Zagame’s House in inner-city Carlton.
The swanky hotel, which offers rooms for $650 a night, eerily backs onto the rental home Zonfrillo had lived in with his family since 2020.
Local business owners say they witnessed police vehicles arriving at the hotel in the early hours of Monday.
Zagame’s House management denied the MasterChef judge died at their hotel when contacted by news.com.au, despite numerous reports confirming police were called to the building.
Zonfrillo, his wife and their two young kids had reportedly packed up their bags and moved to the Italian city of Rome just three weeks before his death. 
Their home was placed back on the rental market for $3000 a week in April.
A neighbour of Zonfrillo in the Carlton terrace where he and his family had lived told Seven News on Tuesday that Zonfrillo “left three weeks ago”.
Carlton resident Stuart Ayer said: “He left about three weeks ago. Obviously he’s come back and who knows what happened.”
Zonfrillo’s family announced the MasterChef judge’s death in a statement on Monday afternoon.
“With completely shattered hearts and without knowing how we can possibly move through life without him, we are devastated to share that Jock passed away yesterday,” his family said in a statement.
“So many words can describe him, so many stories can be told, but at this time we’re too overwhelmed to put them into words.
“For those who crossed his path, became his mate, or were lucky enough to be his family, keep this proud Scot in your hearts when you have your next whisky.
“We implore you to please let us grieve privately as we find a way to navigate through this and find space on the other side to celebrate our irreplaceable husband, father, brother, son and friend.”
Tributes have poured in from all over the world for the late chef.
“I’m in total shock to wake up to the sudden death of chef Jock Zonfrillo. We had the best time working together for this years master chef, I can’t tell how good it was to work with him!” Jamie Oliver said on Instagram.
“Jock was very generous to me with his time and spirit in the show and for that I was really grateful … Mellisa, Andy & Jock work as the most inspiring judges and mentors and each have there very own unique view and style…Jock will be so very missed…I can’t believe I’m writing this...”
“Saddened by the devastating news of Jock Zonfrillo‘s passing. I truly enjoyed the time we spent together on MasterChef in Australia,” Gordon Ramsay said on Twitter.
“My deepest condolences and sincere thoughts. I am utterly devastated. We spoke recently,” celebrity chef Joey Vargetto said.
Contestants on the show who spent considerable time with Mr Zonfrillo also expressed their sadness at the loss.
“I’m so shocked… rest in peace chef, my heart and condolences to loved ones,” MasterChef contestant Reynold Poernomo said on Instagram.
“So sad to hear this. Rest in peace Jock. You will be missed,” fellow contestant Brendan Pang said.
The popular TV personality had flown back to Australia for the launch of the 15th season of the competition cooking show, where he was a judge.
Zonfrillo was scheduled to take part in a number of media interviews both ahead of and following the first episode, which was due to air on Monday night.
One of these interviews involved the father-of-four appearing as a guest on Channel 10’s The Project in the evening of his death.
He had battled with a crippling addiction to heroin which had taken hold of his life by the time he was 15.
“I’m not proud of it at all,” he said about his drug use. “It’s embarrassing and it’s embarrassing for my parents. But I’m thankful to have been able to come through the other side of that and I’m thankful for all the people who helped me at the right moments.”
After getting clean, he followed a successful career path and joined the Channel 10 program in 2019 for the 2020 season alongside Melissa Leong and Andy Allen.

“So many words can describe him, so many stories can be told, but at this time we’re too overwhelmed to put them into words.
“For those who crossed his path, became his mate, or were lucky enough to be his family, keep this proud Scot in your hearts when you have your next whisky.
“We implore you to please let us grieve privately as we find a way to navigate through this and find space on the other side to celebrate our irreplaceable husband, father, brother, son and friend.”
Mr Zonfrillo is survived by his wife Lauren Fried and his four children Ava, Sophie, Alfie and Isla.
Police are not treating the death as suspicious. 
“Police attended a Lygon Street address for a welfare check and located a man deceased about 2am on May 1,” a Victoria Police spokesperson said. 
Saddened by the devastating news of Jock Zonfrillo's passing. I truly enjoyed the time we spent together on MasterChef in Australia. Sending all my love to Lauren and the family in this difficult time Gx
“The 46-year-old man‘s death is not being treated as suspicious.”
Mr Zonfrillo had only posted on his own Instagram about the next season of MasterChef that was due to start on Monday, just hours before police would find him dead. 
Network 10 also shared a statement.
“Network 10 and Endemol Shine Australia are deeply shocked and saddened at the sudden loss of Jock Zonfrillo, a beloved member of the MasterChef Australia family. Jock passed away in Melbourne yesterday,” the network said.
“Jock was known to Australians as a chef, best-selling author, philanthropist and MasterChef judge but he will be best remembered as a loving father, husband, brother and son.”
Mr Zonfrillo outlined his struggles with heroin addiction in his book ‘Last Shot’ which details his life story. 
“Jock’s life spiralled out of control when he tried heroin for the first time as a teenager while growing up in 1980s Glasgow,” the book’s blurb reads.

“For years he balanced a career as a rising star amongst legendary chefs with a crippling drug addiction that took him down many dark paths.
“On New Year’s Eve 1999, Jock shot up his last shot of heroin before boarding a plane to Sydney, where he would find passion and new meaning in life in the most unexpected places. 
“There would be more struggles ahead, including two failed marriages, the closure of his prized restaurant during COVID-19, his time on-country, and some very public battles.”
The book was praised for its candour and Mr Zonfrillo was praised for his resilience by the world’s top chefs. 
“I’ve known Jock for 25 years. He is not only a great mate but an incredibly talented chef - in Australia and around the world,” Matt Moran wrote about the book. 
“Last Shot really shows how resilient Jock is and how far he has come in his personal and professional life. I’m inspired by how brave Jock has been for putting this biography out there.”
The renowned chef established himself in Australia as the head chef at Restaurant 41 in Sydney in 2000, before going on to open Restaurant Orana in 2013. 
Restaurant Orana was named as Restaurant of the Year by Gourmet Traveller in 2018 and by the Good Food Guide in 2019.
He initially worked under renowned Michelin-starred chef Marco Pierre White. 
“Zonfrillo climbed his way to the top of the gastronomic ladder only to abdicate his position. He still inspires chefs worldwide,” Mr Pierre White said about Mr Zonfrillo in 2022. 
Mr Zonfrillo grew up in Glasgow to an Italian father and Scottish mother. 
He began working in kitchens as a dishwasher part-time at the age of 13 before going on to leave school to start an apprenticeship in the kitchens of the Turnberry Hotel on the west coast of Scotland. 
Jimmy Barnes was one of the first to pay tribute to his “dear friend”, saying it was a “very sad day” on social media. 
“Jock was like a brother to me and we made each other laugh and cry. My heart goes out to his family. I am speechless,” he said. 
Celebrity chefs Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay also paid tribute to Mr Zonfrillo. 
“I’m in total shock to wake up to the sudden death of chef Jock Zonfrillo. We had the best time working together for this years master chef, I can’t tell how good it was to work with him!” Jamie Oliver said on Instagram.
“Jock was very generous to me with his time and spirit in the show and for that I was really grateful…Mellisa, Andy & Jock work as the most inspiring judges and mentors and each have there very own unique view and style…Jock will be so very missed…I can’t believe I’m writing this...”
“Saddened by the devastating news of Jock Zonfrillo‘s passing,” Mr Ramsay said on Twitter.
“I truly enjoyed the time we spent together on MasterChef in Australia. Sending all my love to Lauren and the family in this difficult time.”MasterChef contestants were also quick to share their saddness. 
“Shocked and heartbroken ️RIP Jock, you will be sorely missed. My condolences to your beautiful family,” Emelia Jackson commented on the family’s statement. 
“I’m so shocked… rest in peace chef, my heart and condolences to loved ones,” Reynold Poernomo said. 
“I am literally in so much shock and hands are shaking. This is devastating news. I am so sad to hear this news,” Minoli Desilva commented. ",https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/masterchefs-jock-zonfrillo-dies-aged-46/news-story/c05e5c79d8f358d0d12c41c1b83c3753

Authorities told Korean news outlet Yonhap News that the singer, whose real name was Moon Bin, was found dead in his home by his manager in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, at around 8.10pm local time Wednesday.
“He appears to have taken his own life but an autopsy is being reviewed to determine the exact cause of death,” police said.
The official cause of death is pending, Page Six reports.
Moonbin’s record label, Fantagio, released a statement on Twitter on Wednesday confirming his death.
“First of all, I apologise for the sad and heartbreaking news,” the post, loosely translated, began.
“On April 19, Astro member Moonbin suddenly left us and became a star in the sky.”
The statement noted that Moonbin’s relatives and all of those who worked with him, including bandmates Cha Eun-woo, Rocky, Yoon San-ha, MJ and Jinjin, were “deeply mourning the deceased in great sadness and shock.”
The team asked fans to “refrain from speculative and malicious reports so that that the bereaved families, who are deeply saddened by the sudden sad news, can reverently commemorate and greet the deceased”.
Moonbin’s funeral will be held “as quietly as possible” with only family members, friends and colleagues attending, the statement also said.
Meanwhile, fans flooded the Candy Sugar Pop singer’s 3.8 million-follower Instagram account to honour him.
One heartbroken follower wrote: “You changed my life. You made me sooooo happy, Bin. Thank you for everything. I’ll love you forever. Rest in peace, my love.”
Another added, “He always had such a big smile on his face which could automatically make a people smile too but now that’s happiness is gone making everyone sad and loss of smile.”
A third said, “As an old K-Poper I hate K-Pop … I feel that those bad days we had in the past have been repeated again … R.I.P. #Moonbin.”
In December 2017, Kim Jonghyun, the former lead singer of top South Korean pop group SHINee, was found dead at his apartment in Seoul.
Then, less than two years later in November 2019, K-Pop star Goo Hara was found dead. She was 28.

7,instagram,news.com.au,2023-05-11,G Flip and Selling Sunset star Chrishell Stause have secretly married,"Australian musician G Flip and their partner, Selling Sunset star Chrishell Stause, secretly said “I do” after just one year of dating.
Stause announced the exciting news on her Instagram alongside a video montage of the happy couple, reported Page Six.
“Love doesn’t always go as planned…Sometimes it’s immeasurably better,” the reality TV personality captioned the video, which featured an image of the pair kissing at the altar.
She went on to call the musician — who goes by they/them pronouns — “the kindest, funniest & most talented hard working people out there”.
The song featured in the emotional video is G Flip’s new track, which they wrote about Stause, titled, I’ll Be Your Man.
Several fellow reality TV stars flocked to Stause’s comments section, congratulating the pair on their nuptials.
“IM DYING!!!!!! I’ve been waiting for this post all day!!!” co-star Emma Hernan wrote. “Covered in goosebumps since the moment I watched! Watching your love is like watching the best love story in the world! I love you both to the [moon] & back!!!!!! CONGRATULATIONS”
“Congratulations my love! So happy for you two,” former Bachelorette Jojo Fletcher added.
“This makes me SOO HAPPY,” Too Hot To Handle star Francesca Fargo, who just got engaged, wrote.
Stause and G Flip first crossed paths in 2021 at a Halloween party while they were dating other people. The two then reconnected at another gathering in February 2022 after breaking up with their respective partners.
In fact, the pair ended up kissing at the party, but Stause — who previously dated Selling Sunset boss and co-star, Jason Oppenheim — said she didn’t think much of it.
“I had no issue doing something like that, but in my head I [didn’t think I] could have a meaningful relationship with somebody …” the former soap star, 41, told Vogue Australia. “I definitely still thought I was straight at that party!”
However, less than six months later, the pair went public with their relationship during the Netflix show’s season five reunion episode.
“I recently have been spending a lot of time with someone that’s very important to me. Their name is G Flip. They’re non-binary, so they go by they/them,” Stause said during the episode. “And they are an extremely talented musician.”
She went on to explain that the pair really connected after G Flip, 28, asked her to be in their music video for “Get Me Outta Here,” which was about a “chaotic love story.”
During the video, the pair got hot and heavy as they made out in a gas station — which led Stause to re-evaluate her sexuality.
“[It] opened my brain up to the fact that I’m attracted to energy, not whatever physical thing that people have in their head,” she told Vogue. “I don’t have a type.”
Their union comes as a surprise to many given the fact Stause previously denied engagement rumours, claiming her diamond ring on that finger was “just a ring and nothing else.”
Prior to her relationship with G Flip, Stause was married to This Is Us star Justin Hartley.

8,instagram,news.com.au,2023-05-01,MasterChef judge and Orana chef Jock Zonfrillo dead at 46,"As Australia is left in shock over the death of chef and MasterChef judge Jock Zonfrillo — more details have come to light about how he spent his final weeks with his family.
The Scottish-born Zonfrillo, 46, was a renowned chef of the much-awarded Orana restaurant in South Australia and joined the Channel 10 program in 2019 for the 2020 season alongside Melissa Leong and Andy Allen.
Production on this year’s season of MasterChef Australia finished about a month ago with Zonfrillo understood to have been in Europe on holiday with his family over recent weeks.
The Daily Telegraphreports his wife, Lauren, and their two young children, Alfie, 6, and Isla, 2, stayed in Rome when Zonfrillo flew home early ahead of the season launch.
The 46-year-old was also a dad to two adult children, Ava and Sophia, from his first two marriages.
He was understood to take part in a round of media interviews on Monday in the lead-up to the premiere episode.
He was due to be a guest live in the studio on The Project on Channel 10 in Melbourne Monday night.
Zonfrillo’s death was confirmed by Channel 10 in a statement on the same day MasterChef was scheduled to return for its 2023 season. The series has been pulled from broadcast for this week.
He died in Melbourne yesterday. A statement from Victoria Police said officers attended a hotel on Lygon Street for a welfare check, where they located a deceased man at approximately 2am. The police said the death was not being treated as suspicious.
No cause of death has been released. 
His family said: “With completely shattered hearts and without knowing how we can possibly move through life without him, we are devastated to share that Jock passed away yesterday.
“So many words can describe him, so many stories can be told, but at this time we’re too overwhelmed to put them into words. For those who crossed his path, became his mate, or were lucky enough to be his family, keep this proud Scot in your hearts when you have your next whisky.
“We implore you to please let us grieve privately as we find a way to navigate through this and find space on the other side to celebrate our irreplaceable husband, father, brother, son and friend.”
Zonfrillo was born in Glasgow to an Italian father and a Scottish mother, growing up in a household with a strong mixed-culture ethos, which is said to have fuelled his obsession with food.
He started looking for work in the industry when he was 12 years old. He worked an apprenticeship at The Turnberry Hotel at 15 and by the time he was 17, he was working with Marco Pierre White at the famous chef’s restaurant.
He opened Bistro Blackwood and Restaurant Orana after moving to Australia. Orana was consistently awarded as one of the world’s best culinary establishment. Orana closed in 2020.
A statement from Channel 10 and Endemol Shine Australia said, “Network 10 and Endemol Shine Australia are deeply shocked and saddened at the sudden loss of Jock Zonfrillo, a beloved member of the MasterChef Australia family.
“Jock was known to Australians as a chef, best-selling author, philanthropist and MasterChef judge, but he will be best remembered as a loving father, husband, brother and son.
“Jock’s charisma, wicked sense of humour, generosity, passion and love for food and his family cannot be measured. He will be greatly missed.”
Tributes from his colleagues have started to come in. TV personality Georgia Love wrote on Instagram, “Absolutely devastating. Jock was so incredibly kind to me, particularly through some really tough times. I am so, so sorry to all his loved ones and everyone who will be affected by this awful news.”
Restaurateur and former My Kitchen Rules judge Colin Fassnidge posted, “RIP my friend, hope to have a whiskey again one day.”
Channel 9 host David Campbell tweeted, “This is terribly sad. My condolences to his wife and kids and all the people he works with,” while actor Rebecca Gibney wrote, “No words. Utterly heartbroken for you.”",https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/reality-tv/masterchef-judge-jock-zonfrillo-dead-at-46/news-story/e432473f20bbbf0b8584cd18b61b6c80

The 61-year-old food critic, who was a judge on MasterChef for a decade, has been announced among the cast for the upcoming season of Dancing With The Stars on Channel 7.
Preston, who left Network Ten in 2019, took to Instagram on Friday morning with a photo of himself on the set, seemingly filming a promotional video for the reality series. His caption read: “So, time for something totally new and way out of my comfort zone!”
Daryl Somers and Sonia Kruger return as hosts, with a stack of local stars set to hit the dance floor.
Former The Bachelor winner turned radio host Laura Byrne is also part of the line-up, as well as Australian actors Mary Coustas, Christie Whelan Browne, Emily Weir, Virginia Gay and Pia Miranda.
TV personalities Charlie Albone, from Better Homes and Gardens, and Issa Shultz from The Chase Australia, are also vying for the trophy, alongside performers Paulini and Human Nature singer Phil Burton. 
Representing sport, Olympians Sally Pearson and James Magnussen and AFL legend Gavin Wanganeen make up the cast.
The celebrities will be divided into two groups, and will hit the dance floor on alternate nights across the season. The leaderboard will be determined by a combination of judges’ scores and scores from the studio audience.
Byrne, who shot to fame on Matty J’s season of The Bachelor in 2017, said on KIIS FM’s The Pick Up on Thursday she had been rehearsing for up to 25 hours a week.
“I’ve been training my absolute a**e off, literally my a**e is gone – look how flat it is. I’ve got nothing left on me,” she said. 
“I am so unbelievably bad I look like a baby giraffe that’s just been birthed. Or like a praying mantis or stick insect when they’re about to move forward and they go back and forth before they move.”
Matty J, who was a contestant on the show in 2021, called into the show to give his wife some hot tips.
“It’s hard work, it’s dedication, you’ve got to put in the hours, you’ve got to stay really focused,” he said. 
“Something that I did which really helped me is you get a little bit of wax, just a little bit, not too much, and you rub it on everyone else’s shoes just before they go out and it helps that little bit more,” he joked.
“It’s not cheating – I guess, any little advantage that you can give yourself over the others I think you have to take.”
Seven didn’t reveal an official air date, adding DWTS would return to screens soon.

10,instagram,news.com.au,2023-05-03,MasterChef Australia to air this Sunday following Jock Zonfrillo’s death,"MasterChef Australia will return to screens on Sunday May 7 with the full support of Jock Zonfrillo’s family, despite the tragic loss of the show’s beloved judge. 
The upcoming season will be dedicated to Jock’s memory, and the contestants will no doubt continue to be inspired by his passion for cooking and mentoring.
 Zonfrillo was a much-loved member of the MasterChef Australia family, known for his warm personality, infectious energy, and incredible culinary skills.
“MasterChef Australia Judge Jock Zonfrillo took great pride in challenging and coaching the contestants and of course inspiring a nation of home cooks,” Channel 10 said in a statement released on Wednesday night.
“It is with Jock in our hearts that we cherish this season and remember the charismatic and big-hearted Judge and Chef who we knew and loved. Jock will be remembered in the MasterChef Australia kitchen for years to come. 
“A special edition of The Sunday Project will pay tribute to Jock from 6.30pm on Sunday, 7 May.
“With contributions from friends, he held closely, the show will honour Jock by reflecting on his personal and professional life in a celebration of his incredible achievements.”
While Channel 10 announced the program would not air any earlier than May 8, an insider said any further decisions on the future on the series were the late chef’s family’s — specifically his wife Lauren Fried — to make.
Filming of the latest season finished several weeks ago, with Zonfrillo flying back from Europe early for promotional interviews for the new series.
Jock had secretly moved to new country
The statement from Ten comes as details have revealed the simple reason Zonfrillo was apart from his family in a Melbourne hotel where he was tragically found dead, just hours before the new season of MasterChef was set to air. 
The popular TV personality had reportedly moved to the Italian city of Rome in the weeks before his death. He had flown back to Australia for the launch of the 15th season of the competition cooking show, where he was a judge. 
A neighbour of Zonfrillo in the Carlton terrace where he and his family had lived told Seven News on Tuesday that Zonfrillo “left three weeks ago”.
Carlton resident Stuart Ayer said: “He left about three weeks ago. Obviously he’s come back and who knows what happened.”
It’s understood the family journeyed to the European country after filming for the hit culinary TV show concluded about a month ago.
Entertainment reporter Peter Ford wrote on social media on Tuesday evening that Jock “had actually moved to Rome to live” for what “was to have been an exciting new chapter for the family”.
His wife Lauren and their two young children Alfie, 5, and Isla, 2, were still in Rome while Zonfrillo returned to Australia to prepare for the season’s launch.
They are believed to be arriving back in Australia late on Tuesday night.

The 46-year-old also has two other adult children from previous marriages, Ava and Sophia, although it’s not suggested they were on the trip with Zonfrillo’s young family. 
As for why Zonfrillo came to Australia early, The Daily Telegraph reports he was scheduled to take part in a number of media interviews both ahead of and following the first episode, which was due to air on Monday night.
One of these interviews involved the father-of-four appearing as a guest on Channel 10’s The Project in the evening of his death.
Tragically, Zonfrillo’s body was found at 2am on Monday after police were called to his Lygon street hotel to conduct a welfare check.
While inquiries are still underway to determine his cause of death, it is not being treated as suspicious. 
Channel 10 has since announced it will delay the broadcast of the new MasterChef season for one week, following the judge’s unexpected passing. 
Zonfrillo appears alongside Australian food critic Melissa Leong and cook Andy Allen in the series, which also features English restaurateur Jamie Oliver as a guest. 
The trio replaced the show’s original judges Matt Preston, George Calombaris and Gary Mehigan in 2020.
The role prompted Zonfrillo to move his family from Adelaide to Melbourne in 2021 due to the judge spending half the year in south Victoria for the show’s filming. 
Previews of the highly-anticipated 15th season had been teasing fans for weeks, with Zonfrillo also posting a promo to his Instagram the night before his death.
“The time has come for @masterchefau to kick off a new season filled with Secrets & Surprises! And @jamieoliver of course!” he wrote.
Network 10 and his family made the shock announcement regarding Zonfrillo’s death on Monday afternoon, while declaring that MasterChef would be postponed for a week due to the judge’s sudden death.
“With completely shattered hearts and without knowing how we can possibly move through life without him, we are devastated to share that Jock passed away yesterday,” Jock’s family said in a statement on Monday.
“So many words can describe him, so many stories can be told, but at this time we’re too overwhelmed to put them into words.
“For those who crossed his path, became his mate, or were lucky enough to be his family, keep this proud Scot in your hearts when you have your next whisky.

Meanwhile Network 10 said: “Network 10 and Endemol Shine Australia are deeply shocked and saddened at the sudden loss of Jock Zonfrillo, a beloved member of the MasterChef Australia family. Jock passed away in Melbourne yesterday,” the network said.

11,instagram,news.com.au,2023-04-21,How Argylica Conditsis turned Babyboo Fashion into $60m empire,"At just 17 years old, fashion-loving Argylica Conditsis took $1000 she had saved from her part-time Pizza Hut job and invested it in her “hobby”.
The Sydney teen had a “crazy idea” to sell statement shoes, and began listing them online after embellishing and bedazzling them herself back in 2011.
They were an instant hit – and just 12 years later, her Babyboo Fashion brand has gone from a gamble that began in her bedroom to a growing fashion empire valued at a staggering $60 million.
It’s not a bad achievement for a young woman who is yet to see her 30th birthday.
“It has been a bit of a roller coaster after starting when I was really young – I had just finished high school and was on holidays between school and uni when we started,” she told news.com.au.
“I had been working late night and weekend shifts at Pizza Hut during school and making something like $6 an hour, so saving $1000 was a lot for me back then, and I put it all into stock.
“It was definitely not supposed to be a business – it was just a hobby, but when we first put the shoes online they went viral. I popped them on a Facebook page and it kind of evolved naturally over time.”
Ms Conditsis’ brother William has been with her every step of the way, and she eventually “stole him” out of uni to work on the business full time, after also dropping out of her own Visual Communications degree to focus on building up the brand. 
Within three years of launching the online business, the pair decided to expand into clothing, and after initially running Babyboo out of Ms Conditsis’ bedroom and taking over “every inch” of her parents’ Baulkham Hills home, it was soon time to expand into a proper warehouse and office.
Today, Babyboo has customers in almost 150 countries around the globe, a team of more than 40 employees and 1.1 million Instagram followers.
Ms Conditsis said one of her secrets to success was really understanding her customers from day one.
“I started bedazzling shoes myself because there were just no products like them out there … I always liked to be the one that stood out with outfits and I realised we’d have to start (making them) ourselves as there was a gap in the market,” she explained.
“If you’d told me back then we’d be as big as we are today I would have laughed at you – there’s no way I would have believed it and it is now so much bigger than I ever imagined.
“We never had a business plan or goal and each year that the business would double would come as a surprise.
“Now it’s more of a structured business with processes and strategies but in the early days it was all trial and error and learning from our mistakes quickly.”
The now-29-year-old said it was a blessing to work so closely with her brother.
“It has been great to join forces with him – we’re so alike, but have our own strengths and weaknesses that work well together,” she said.
“Will is really good at understanding operations and processes and is very creative as well, and I focus more on the product, brand and social side of things.”
She said the biggest achievement for her personally was building a business from “absolutely nothing” with no financial backing to one now valued at $60 million, which has also allowed her to build up a team and community of women who “share the same passion”.
“We empower a lot of women around the world by making them feel good, we’re with hundreds of thousands of women worldwide for all their special occasions,” she said.
“Dressing them and making them feel empowered is what gets me up every morning – it’s not just a business, it actually serves a purpose.”
However, it hasn’t all been smooth sailing.
Like most retailers, Babyboo took a hit during the Covid pandemic, but was able to quickly pivot and expand into loungewear, which was soon snapped up by those living through brutal lockdowns.
The move saw sales boom – and now, the next step for the thriving business is continuing its international expansion, settling into a new office and warehouse and launching new collections to increase the offering for customers. 
When it comes to advice for other budding young entrepreneurs, Ms Conditsis said it was simple.
“I always say never compare your chapter one to someone else’s chapter six – eventually, you’ll get there, after going through a process of evolving and learning,” she said.
“When I was young, there were a lot of people who didn’t take me seriously and I got a lot of nos, but I think most of the businesses that will rise in the coming years will be from young people, who are very in tune with social media and have a lot to offer.”",https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/sydney-woman-turns-1000-pizza-hut-earnings-into-60-million-fashion-empire-in-just-12-years/news-story/b2f4af56e67430fac8a4c5a1f3ce66b6
12,instagram,news.com.au,2023-04-21,Transportable Shade Sheds collapse: Customer furious after learning Sunshine Coast company owes $1.3 million,"A shed supplier on the Sunshine Coast has become the latest casualty to join a spate of companies in the sector which have gone bankrupt in recent months.
Mooloolaba-based business Transportable Shade Sheds has left dozens of Australians out-of-pocket and have failed to pay their workers’ leave entitlements after going into liquidation on April 3.
The failed company is now under external administration and owes more than $1.3 million to about 160 trade suppliers and creditors.
Bill Cotter of Robson Cotter Insolvency Group was appointed liquidator of the company following its collapse.
There are an additional five other companies set up as a group of related entities which have also ceased trading including Vanquish Holdings Pty Ltd, Bend Tube Designs Pty Ltd, Sable Labour Hire Pty Ltd, Tochlo Pty Ltd and TSS Dealers Pty Ltd. 
“The businesses had ceased to trade shortly prior to the date of liquidation,” a statement from the liquidators read on its website. 
“The Liquidator will not be trading-on the business operations of the companies during the liquidation process.”
An investigation into the cause of the companies failures is now underway, with the insolvency group currently “securing and realising” the assets.
Robson Cotter from the independent boutique advisory firm told the Courier Mail there were dozens of customers who had received partial or fully incomplete orders at the time the company went broke.
“The amount potentially owing to customers with partially or fully incomplete orders delivered is currently unquantified,” he said.
Mr Cotter added several staff from the company were owed money for leave entitlements and superannuation.
Robert Salomon is understood to be the company director of Transportable Shade Sheds which was founded just over two decades ago in 2002.
Mr Salomon built the “nationally recognised company with international aspirations” alongside his partner Kylie, which offered a number of easy installation sheds, quickshades and canvacons.
“We supply our Shade Sheds as a pre-engineered kit that has been designed for anyone to erect. So, no welding or technical knowledge is required,” the company explained on its website.
“We swage the frames for you and with our slip fit connection system, it is just a matter of simply joining them together!”
The company’s website remains active despite its insolvency with customers still able to make inquiries to order products.
As for its social media pages, there were little signs to show the company was struggling, with the last post made to the Transportable Shade Sheds (TSS) Instagram and Facebook accounts asking customers to send a picture of their installed purchase.
“Happy Friday! Check out this awesome shot from one of our customers! Have you got any photos of Your Shade Shed? We’d love to see them,” the post is captioned.
“We hope you all have a nice weekend!”
Customers who have been impacted by the company’s closure have resorted to a Facebook group to vent their frustrations about the lack of notice they were given to suggest the company had gone bust. 
One loyal customer who has purchased seven sheds from the company said she ordered two sheds in June last year and paid the deposit only to never receive the products.
“I’m devastated, angry and can’t wait for karma and the legal system to catch up with them so they can pay with what they have done to us and other families, including staff,” she wrote.
“They chased us in the last two weeks for the balance of $15,000 and we refused to pay till the sheds were delivered to our premises in good order first. 
“I’m so glad we never paid them the extra money and now we have to see how we get our deposit back as we worked extremely hard for the money just like everyone else that got scammed by TSS.” 
Meanwhile one Victorian customer was left with the framework and anchors of a shed after he failed to receive its panels.
“I was told when the original framework was out for shipping, that the suppliers of the panels (are) state specific. Wondering if they are laying at a factory or depot somewhere in Victoria,” he said. 
“I really feel for those who have spent the money with zero to show for.”
A third person who claims they were a dealer and reseller for the company said he now has to find $90,000 to refund customer deposits for sheds “they are not going to get”. 
“It‘s going to put me close to the edge, but I should hopefully just be able to keep my head above water after I have refunded my customers,” he said.
“At least my customers will get every cent back whereas there must be hundreds, if not thousands of people around Australia that bought directly through them and will not get a penny back, I feel for them.”
The insolvency group recommends affected customers and creditors to submit a Proof of Debt form to register their claim via its email – admin@rcinsol.com.au.

13,instagram,news.com.au,2023-05-03,Comedian Stephanie Broadbridge on trolling after joke TikTok video viewed 47 million times,"COMMENT
It was a Sunday morning, I’m a stand-up comedian and I was booked for an unusual gig. I would be sitting opposite a male comedian as we read dad jokes from the internet to each other and tried not to laugh. If we did laugh, we had to take a shot of vodka. 
It was early in the morning and I’m allergic to alcohol so I was pretty motivated to win the challenge. 
I won 10-1. 
The challenge was filmed and turned into short clips for the relatively small Aussie TikTok account YeahMadTV. I was paid $200 and I assumed the video content would disappear into social media land like the billions of other comedy videos that no one ever sees. But that’s not what happened. 
The clips went viral. One clip currently has over 47 million views and counting. 
Best dog joke ever written. #dadjokes#dadjokesoftheday#dadjoke#jokes#fyp#dadjokesoftiktok
The joke? What do you call a dog that can do magic? A Labra-cadabrador.
Why was it so popular? Because people hated me and left vicious, sexist comments to let me know exactly how much. The more they commented, the more views the video received. 
When the clip was posted, the important information that I was a performer in a ‘try not to laugh challenge’ wasn’t included. Instead, it was captioned “Best dog joke ever written’ so when I didn’t laugh at the joke, I just looked mean.
The commentary seemed to be that how dare I, a woman, not laugh at the funny man’s joke (not his joke, a joke off the internet). I must be a Karen, a feminist, a cat lady, a [redacted] who doesn’t have a sense of humour. The few people in the comments who tried to stick up for me by explaining it was a challenge, were also attacked.
I contacted YeahMadTV and they removed some of the nastiest comments and put in the comments that it was the ‘try not to laugh’ challenge but it didn’t stop there. The video developed a life of its own. 
One anonymous account reposted the clip on 9gag, a social media platform that allows users to upload and share content from other social media sites. It was shared under the caption ‘She has no sense of Humour’. The thousands of comments on 9gag, that I can’t delete, are so disgusting that I couldn’t get through them.
Once I realised YeahMadTV had tagged me, I untagged myself immediately but the trolls still found me.
They wrote negative comments on every stand-up comedy clip I had on TikTok and Instagram. 
I was running ads for my live stand up shows at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and those ads all had to be removed because of the trolling. 
It is very hard to be funny when every time I tell a joke on stage, I can picture these vile comments screaming at me from the audience.
On the final night of my Melbourne Comedy Festival run I broke down. I left the stage ten minutes into my show and burst into tears. I have been performing comedy almost every single night for seven years and this has never happened to me before. I am professional and reliable. I don’t cancel. I built my reputation on being ‘the chick that doesn’t cancel’.
Yes, of course, men get negative comments online too, but this was different. The language was gendered. It was violent. It was threatening. The attacks were intended to silence me, intimidate me and humiliate me, because I had committed a mortal sin of womanhood, not laughing at a man’s crappy joke. I know I’m the least objective person in this situation but it’s hard to deny the lashings of misogyny. 
Sure, I could delete social media. If I stop putting myself out there, then people will stop trolling me. But I am a stand-up comedian. This is my job. Part of that job is promoting myself online and I deserve to feel safe at work. 
It’s not just the arts where a strong social media presence is a requirement. Social media is an integral part of most careers. Nearly every employer checks you out online before hiring you, so to say “just ignore it” is completely unreasonable.
That’s asking me to ignore the cheapest and most efficient way to promote myself. “Don’t worry about it” or “don’t post things if you don’t want to get attacked” does not resolve the issue. I am worried about it. It’s disgusting, it’s sexist and it’s ruining my career.
Given social media is an important part of our work life and women are trolled more than men how is that workplace equality? Why are we accepting trolling as a consequence of being online?
The number of women in comedy I have spoken to that have received similar treatment online is truly horrifying. Some have quit comedy, some have been seeking mental health treatment ever since, some just put up with it as part of the deal.
I don’t have a solution, but I would suggest that next time you are tempted to write a mean comment on a random clip for no other reason except that you’re bored, maybe don’t.

14,instagram,news.com.au,2023-04-16,Chinese diplomat blasts Australian Government ban on TikTok,"A former Chinese diplomat has labelled Australia’s TikTok ban on government devices “racism”, telling the Government: “You do not want to have an enemy with 1.4 billion people.”
In an interview with 60 Minutes, former diplomat and CCP mouthpiece Victor Gao said of the ban: “Probably it’s racism, probably it’s racial discrimination, probably it’s banning Chinese again, which was a disaster many years ago.
“Now you want to do that again? It will not be a success.”
The Australian Government banned the Chinese-owned social media platform from all government devices, citing fears over security. It follows similar bans in many other countries around the world.
“This has been informed by security agencies’ advice on work that’s been done and provided to the government, so that’s the decision we’ve taken is around government-issued devices,” Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said earlier this month.
Concerns over the scope of personal information that TikTok harvests and its parent company ByteDance’s apparent links to the communist regime has led governments around the world to believe that China could be weaponising the social media app to spy on their citizens.
Cybersecurity expert Robert Potter previously told 60 Minutes that the app collects a lot more data than other social media sites.
“It can collect your keystroke patterns, body language, face and body features. It can access photos or passwords that are stored in your phone over time,” he said.
“There’s a super location field that allows them to collect which direction you’re facing, how fast you’re moving, how high off the ground you are, your latitude and longitude.”
However Mr Gao said Australia shouldn’t feel threatened by the app.
“Australians need to be really confident about their own system, rather than being threatened by TikTok. Banning it is not a sign of strength. It’s not a sign of superiority, it’s not a sign of confidence. It’s just the opposite,” he said.
He also said the ban could cause further tensions in Australia’s already strained relationship with China.
“I would urge the Australian Government to really treat China as an equal, because you do not want to have an enemy with 1.4 billion people,” he said.
Meanwhile, TikTok Australia and New Zealand general manager Lee Hunter insists the ban is politically motivated, saying there was “no evidence” to support that people’s data was at risk.
He also told 60 Minutes TikTok Australia will not hand over personal information to the CCP.
“We need to be careful about how we work with China, but at the end of the day TikTok is not China. We’re an entertainment platform. We’re about giving people interesting videos in their day,” he said.
All the countries that have total or partial bans on TikTok:
Australia isn’t alone in its ban of TikTok from government devices. Many countries around the world have taken similar measures.
Australia: TikTok banned from all federal government-owned devices.
New Zealand: On March 17, New Zealand announced TikTok would be banned from the phones of government politicians at the end of the month. But it only applies to about 500 people in the parliamentary complex.
Estonia: At the end of March, Estonia’s outgoing minister of IT and foreign trade, Kristjan Järvan, said TikTok would be banned from smartphones issued by the state to public officials.
UK: On March 16, an immediate ban was announced of the app on government official devices.
EU governing bodies: The European Parliament, European Commission, and the EU Council have all banned TikTok on staff devices, citing cybersecurity concerns.
France: On March 24, the French government banned the installation and use of “recreational” applications such as TikTok, Netflix and Instagram on the work phones of 2.5 million civil servants.
Netherlands: The government discourages the use of all apps from “countries with an aggressive cyber-program” on phones distributed by the government. TikTok wasn’t mentioned by name.
Norway: On March 23, the Norwegian parliament banned TikTok from devices issued to government employees.
Belgium: On March 10, Belgium announced it was banning TikTok from devices owned or paid for by Belgium’s federal government for at least six months.
Denmark: On March 6, Denmark’s Defence Ministry announced it would “ban the use of the app on official units” as a cybersecurity measure.
USA: Government agencies were given until the end of March to delete TikTok from federal devices and systems. However some US politicians have been advocating an outright ban. However, a bid to ban TikTok from operating in the United States altogether was blocked in the senate on March 30. Now, though, Montana has passed a bill to ban TikTok outright from the state. If signed into law, it could come into effect from January 2024.
Canada: The country announced on February 28 it was banning TikTok from all government-issued devices.
India: In 2020, India imposed a ban on TikTok and some other Chinese apps, shortly after a clash between Indian and Chinese troops at a disputed Himalayan border.
Taiwan: In December 2022, Taiwan imposed a TikTok ban on all government devices.
Pakistan: Pakistani authorities have temporarily banned TikTok at least four times since October 2020, citing concerns that the app promotes immoral content.
Afghanistan: Taliban leaders banned TikTok in 2022 on the grounds of protecting youths from “being misled”.",https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/social/chinese-diplomat-calls-australia-racist-after-government-tiktok-ban/news-story/879788d1f90f8dcd867829753de1ce4c
15,instagram,news.com.au,2023-05-01,Australian Government announces crackdown on illegal black market vapes,"Australia is set to ban the importation of most vapes, introduce plain packaging and strip them from convenience store shelves under world-first reforms.
The biggest crackdown on e-cigarettes in Australian history is set to be unveiled in the May budget amid fears vaping has emerged as a serious behavioural crisis in schools across the nation.
Under current laws vapes with nicotine can only be bought with a prescription from a chemist. 
But that hasn’t stopped thousands of convenience stores and online providers selling to kids.
Health Minister Mark Butler will unveil the changes on Tuesday under a crackdown that will also involve the states and territories moving to stamp out the growing black market in illegal vaping.
The changes will include tough new laws to:
- Stop the import of non-prescription vapes
- Increase the minimum quality standards for vapes including by restricting flavours, colours, and other ingredients;
- Require pharmaceutical-like packaging;
- Reduce the allowed nicotine concentrations and volumes; and
- Ban all single use, disposable vapes.
But the reforms won’t stop there, with the Albanese Government preparing to work with states and territories to close down the sale of vapes in retail settings, ending vape sales in convenience stores and other retail settings.
Health experts fear the rise of vapes poses a public health crisis with children who vape three times as likely to take up smoking.
Experts claim thousands of children can no longer sit still in class because they are addicted to vaping after smoking “bubblegum” flavours that secretly contain nicotine.
Health Minister Mark Butler said it was clear that governments had to act.
“Vaping was sold to governments and communities around the world as a therapeutic product to help long-term smokers quit,‘’ he said.
“It was not sold as a recreational product - especially not one for our kids. But that is what it has become: the biggest loophole in Australian history.
“One in six teenagers aged 14-17 has vaped. One in four people aged 18-24 has vaped. By contrast, only one in 70 people my age has vaped.
“And when more than a thousand teenagers aged 15 to 17 were asked where they could get vapes, four out of five of them said they found it easy or somewhat easy to buy them in retail stores.
“This is a product targeted at our kids, sold alongside lollies and chocolate bars.”
Mr Butler said schools were now struggling to deal with the fallout.
“Vaping has become the number one behavioural issue in high schools. And it’s becoming widespread in primary schools,” he said.
“Over the past 12 months, Victoria’s poisons hotline has taken 50 calls about children under 4 becoming sick from ingesting or using a vape.
“Under the age of 4! Vapes contain 200 toxic chemicals that do not belong in the lungs, the same chemicals you’ll find in nail polish remover and weed killer.
“Just like they did with smoking, Big Tobacco has taken another addictive product, wrapped it in shiny packaging and added flavours to create a new generation of nicotine addicts.
 “Vapers are three times as likely to take up smoking, which explains why under 25s are the only cohort in the community currently recording an increase in smoking rates.
“This must end.”
Vape police could be rolled out to monitor the sale of e-cigarettes to children across Australia including on TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram under a plan that will ban most imports and introduce plain packaging.
VicHealth CEO Sandro Demaio, a globally-renowned public health expert and medical doctor, told news.com.au that as soon as the Albanese Government introduced new import bans enforcement could be much tougher at a state level.
“In many ways this explosion of vaping has really come out of nowhere over just a couple of years,’’ he said.
“But the reverse is also possible if we ban the advertising of vapes and actually clamp down on the use of social media to promote these products.
“If we make them less alluring, so they don’t they don’t come in Froot Loops flavour and look like a highlighter. They don’t have unicorns on the side. That will make them far less appealing.
“And basically cut off the tap at the border. Those things will absolutely make a huge difference.”
Dr Demaio said that introducing plain packaging was important because that would then allow enforcement to swing into action.
“Obviously, we want to close the access and the huge amount of vapes that have been finding their way into the hands of particularly young people,’’ he said.
“So what needs to happen at the state level is that there needs to be a licensing scheme in every state.
“The licences themselves would create revenue, which can support enforcement officers, so we’re not relying on police to enforce the measures that we currently have.
“In theory, they’re not currently subject to the laws because they don’t contain nicotine. But the vast majority do contain nicotine; they’re just simply not putting in all the packets.
“And really, what needs to be done is to say, ‘Well, if there’s no flavours, no colours and the only pathway through a prescription, and they, they, they have pharmaceutical packaging, it then makes it much easier for the states to actually enforce it.”
He warned children were being “viciously” exploited.
“Well, what’s happened over the last few years is that the tobacco industry and the e-cigarette industry, of which there’s huge overlap, has seen an opportunity to, you know, get another entire generation of Australians addicted to nicotine with a new product. That’s flown under the radar,’’ he said.
“This industry has used young people’s social media. These things are all over social media. You can jump on Tik Tok and there are ads for E cigarettes with a ‘Buy Now’ button.
“Social media is under-regulated in this country. They have flooded the market with really cheap imports from overseas that don’t declare that they contain nicotine.
“And it’s been a combination of social media, weaponising their data on social media and flooding the market with really cheap and highly addictive imports.”",https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/australian-government-announces-crackdown-on-illegal-black-market-vapes/news-story/9771ff97a465a95b49945da68b61fb00
0,instagram,Guardian,2023-05-11,Liz Truss’s plan to visit Taiwan called ‘worst kind of Instagram diplomacy’,"The Conservative chair of the foreign affairs select committee has launched a blistering attack on Liz Truss over the former prime minister’s planned trip to Taiwan, calling it “the worst kind of Instagram diplomacy”. Alicia Kearns said she thought Truss’s trip planned for next week was little more than a vanity project aimed at keeping her profile high after her brief spell as prime minister last year. Truss is planning to travel to show “solidarity” with the Taiwanese people amid aggression from Beijing. Taiwan is a self-governing democracy, but Beijing regards it as a renegade province which must be reunited with the mainland. Truss’s trip has the potential to upset the British government’s carefully balanced approach to Chinese relations, with the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, arguing the UK should not “pull the shutters down on China”. Kearns said: “The trip is performative, not substantive. It is the worst kind of example of Instagram diplomacy.” She added that the trip was likely to make life harder for the Taiwanese people, who already have to live with a higher level of Chinese military action on their doorstep after the visit by Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the US House of Representatives. Beijing responded to that visit by dispatching warships and military jets to surround the island and firing missiles over it. “It is deeply unhelpful because it escalates the normal situation in Taiwan,” Kearns said. “Taiwanese people already have to live with more Chinese military manoeuvres because of Nancy Pelosi’s visit. Liz Truss doesn’t have any influence any more – this is more about keeping herself relevant.” A spokesperson for Truss hit back saying: “The former prime minister has been invited to visit by the Taiwan government. They are better placed to know what is in the interests of the Taiwanese people than the MP for Rutland. “The future of Taiwan as a free democracy is at stake. Alicia Kearns should apologise for misusing her position as a select committee chair to engage in petty political attacks.” Truss announced on Tuesday she planned to visit the island, calling it a “beacon of freedom and democracy”. The trip follows one to Washington last month, where she gave the annual Margaret Thatcher freedom lecture to the conservative thinktank the Heritage Foundation. She used that speech to attack “wokeism” and argue that her downfall had been the result of a conspiracy by vested interests within the government. The government has not commented except to say that it would not get involved in the “independent travel decisions of a private citizen who is not a member of the government”.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/11/liz-trusss-taiwan-visit-called-instagram-diplomacy-alicia-kearns-foreign-affairs-select-committee-chair
1,instagram,Guardian,2023-05-10,The lawyer whose sex trafficking case against Instagram could spell trouble for big tech,"On 14 March 2022, Annie McAdams, a personal injury lawyer running a small firm in Houston, Texas, filed a civil action suit on behalf of one of her clients. The plaintiff was a 23-year-old woman, who had endured years of sexual exploitation at the hands of a convicted trafficker. The defendant was one of the most powerful technology companies in the world. Contained within McAdams’s federal suit was a series of allegations that Meta – the owner of Facebook and Instagram, which are used by more than 3 billion people every day – had knowingly created a breeding ground for human trafficking and was actively facilitating the buying and selling of people for sex online. The lawsuit alleges that the company’s products – particularly Instagram – connects vulnerable victims with human traffickers and sex buyers, and provides traffickers with the means to groom those victims. It says that human trafficking victims are regularly posted on Instagram and sold for sex against their will and claims that the company has failed to take adequate steps to stop this. In the court documents, the plaintiff – who we are calling Shawna – says she was 18 when she was first contacted on Instagram by a man she didn’t know. She claims that the man – referred to as RL in the court papers – sent her messages on her public profile and on Instagram’s direct-messaging service and that this campaign of grooming led to her agreeing to meet him in person. Two days after their first meeting, she claims that RL began to sell her to sex buyers on Instagram. She claims that RL posted explicit pictures of her on Instagram along with emojis such as dollar signs, crowns and roses, widely recognised by law enforcement and trafficking experts as indicators of commercial sex adverts. “[Meta Inc] knew that the use of these codes were blatant red flags … and were actually sex trafficking advertisements designed to sell her for sex, but [Meta] did nothing to remove or prevent those repeated posts, despite having the ability to do so,” the court papers say. Shawna alleges that over the course of a year she was sold on Instagram to multiple sex buyers. She says she was threatened with homelessness or violence by RL if she refused to fulfil her “quota” of sex acts. She went on to testify against RL in a federal criminal trial in Texas and he was subsequently sentenced to 40 years for sex trafficking. However, the lawsuit claims that at the time it was filed to the court in Houston, Instagram had not removed the trafficker’s Instagram account. McAdams claims that despite repeated attempts by Meta to get the case dismissed, Shawna, who is seeking damages from the company, is now on the brink of taking her civil claim against Meta further through the US court system than any other case has managed. She believes that there are now no serious legal obstacles between her case and bringing Meta before a jury in 2024 to face allegations that it played an integral role in the trafficking of her client. A spokesperson for Meta said that Meta prohibits sex trafficking on its platforms “in no uncertain terms … we vigorously deny the claims made against Meta in this suit.” It is not the first time that Meta – in either of its guises as Meta Platforms Inc or Facebook Inc – has faced lawsuits containing similar allegations. Yet in the two decades since it was launched by Mark Zuckerberg from a Harvard dorm, his company – which rebranded from Facebook to Meta in 2021 – like other technology companies with servers based in the US, has never faced prosecution for illegal and harmful content and activities on its platforms. For decades, social media companies have sheltered behind an obscure clause in the 1996 Communications Decency Act – called section 230, which concludes that technology companies are not legally responsible for crimes that occur on their platforms. Section 230 states that providers of “interactive computer services” – which includes the owners of social media platforms and website hosts – should not be treated as the publisher of material posted by users. Since the act was passed, tech companies such as Meta have argued successfully in US courts that section 230 provides them with immunity from prosecution for any illegal content published on their platforms, as long as they are unaware of that content’s existence, building a fortress of legal precedent. Section 230 does not shield online platforms from federal criminal charges if they are seen as responsible for facilitating trafficking. And a recent amendment to section 230 – known as the Fosta-Sesta package – means that companies can be held liable under state and civil laws but must be shown to have knowingly assisted or facilitated sex trafficking. Other cases have attempted to swerve section 230, but in her federal suit, McAdams is instead tackling it head-on, arguing that it has been misunderstood and was never intended to protect a social media company which, she claims, knowingly allows crimes against children to occur on its platforms. “The problem is not section 230,” McAdams says. “The problem is 20 years of bad precedent and the court’s misinterpretation of 230. In no place does it say that there should be immunity. There is a big difference between immunity and no liability.” McAdams’ decision to tackle the interpretation of liability under section 230 comes as changing legal winds across the US challenge the lack of accountability granted to tech companies. The debate around section 230 has become highly polarised. Those who want the clause amended say that the legal safe haven it has provided for internet companies means they have no incentive to root out illegal content on their sites. Others warn that amending section 230 would curb free speech and dismantle democratic values online. Some sex worker groups also warn that undermining section 230 would harm their business and make them unsafe. McAdams says that the only way to stop social media platforms being used as online marketplaces for sex trafficking is through the courts. Along with Shawna’s case, McAdams has several similar suits filed against Meta across the US in which other plaintiffs allege that Meta enabled, facilitated and profited from their sex trafficking. “After years of being silenced, I hope my clients will have their day in court,” she says. “Their bravery and resilience has started something that could finally see the internet become a safer place for children and open the door for other survivors to be heard. I have many, many more victims waiting to have their cases reviewed. This is just the start.” A Meta spokesperson said: “Sex trafficking is abhorrent … we cooperate with law enforcement so they can find and prosecute the criminals who commit these heinous acts, and we use technology to help keep this abuse off our platforms.” “Our goal is to prevent people who seek to exploit others from using our platform, and we work closely with anti-trafficking experts and safety organisations around the world to inform these efforts. We will continue to join with others across society in the fight against sex trafficking and the predators who engage in it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/may/10/lawyer-sex-trafficking-case-against-instagram-could-spell-trouble-for-big-tech

First impressions? Really positive. Here was someone with great style who cares about how they look; someone confident who has excellent moustache game. What did you talk about? All the cardinal sins of a first date: politics, exes and comparing mutuals on Instagram (a test for any gay man in London). Reece was super-engaging on everything from sustainability to his love of pretentious theatre. Most awkward moment? Very few – conversation flowed naturally. And the overlap of certain “acquaintances” on Instagram raised a few eyebrows and laughs. Good table manners? Excellent, although waiting to mention his dairy intolerance until I was tucking into a chocolate fondant wasn’t great timing. Best thing about Reece? His confidence and charisma.

What do you think Reece made of you? I wouldn’t like to presume – hopefully he thought I wasn’t too awful. Did you go on somewhere? As we were in Soho, we went on for a bottle of wine (or two…) at a queer bar. And… … did you kiss? A real lady never kisses on date one. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? Getting thrown out of the bar we were drinking in (it was closing time). Marks out of 10? A really lovely evening: 9/10! Would you meet again? Definitely. Reece on Will What were you hoping for? Good conversation and easy on the eye. First impressions? Tall, handsome, incredibly charming. My gran would love him! What did you talk about? Will leading his company’s LGBTQ+ network. Coming out. Politics. How EastEnders’ Christian and Syed were my gay awakening. Failed relationships. Most awkward moment? The gentleman that Will is stood up to greet me when I arrived. I went in for a hug instead of a handshake: 30 seconds I wish to forget. Good table manners? Aye, no notes from me. Best thing about Will? Himself! Great vibes. He seems to be living his most authentic life, and it was a delight to have a courtside seat. Would you introduce Will to your friends? Only after I’d sat my boys down and made them swear not to embarrass me. Describe Will in three words South London’s finest. What do you think Will made of you? I think he used the term “been round the block” to describe me. Did you go on somewhere? We went to a bar and sank two bottles of wine. We were queer men in Soho – it would have been boorish not to. And… … did you kiss? The only kiss I had was from the cold window of the number 8 bus I fell asleep against on the way home. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?

3,instagram,Guardian,2023-04-27,How Facebook and Instagram became marketplaces for child sex trafficking,"Maya Jones* was only 13 when she first walked through the door of Courtney’s House, a drop-in centre for victims of child sex trafficking in Washington DC. “She was so young, but she was already so broken by what she’d been through,” says Tina Frundt, the founder of Courtney’s House. Frundt, one of Washington DC’s most prominent specialists in countering child trafficking, has worked with hundreds of young people who have suffered terrible exploitation at the hands of adults, but when Maya eventually opened up about what she had been through, Frundt was shaken. Maya told Frundt that when she was 12, she had started receiving direct messages on Instagram from a man she didn’t know. She said the man, who was 28, told her she was really pretty. According to Frundt, Maya told her that after she started chatting with the man, he asked her to send him naked photos. She told Frundt that he said he would pay her $40 for each one. He seemed kind and he kept giving Maya compliments, which made her feel special. She decided to meet him in person. Then came his next request: “Can you help me make some money?” According to Frundt, Maya explained that the man asked her to pose naked for photos, and to give him her Instagram password so that he could upload the photos to her profile. Frundt says Maya told her that the man, who was now calling himself a pimp, was using her Instagram profile to advertise her for sex. Before long, sex buyers started sending direct messages to her account, wanting to make a date. Maya told Frundt that she had watched, frozen, what was taking place on her account, as the pimp negotiated prices and logistics for meetings in motels around DC. She didn’t know how to say no to this adult who had been so nice to her. Maya told Frundt that she hated having sex with these strangers but wanted to keep the pimp happy. One morning three months after she first met the man, Frundt says that Maya was found by a passerby lying crumpled on a street in south-east DC, half-naked and confused. The night before, Maya told her, a sex buyer had taken her somewhere against her will, and she later recalled being gang-raped there for hours before being dumped on the street. “She was traumatised, and blamed herself for what happened. I had to work with her a lot to help her realise this was not her fault,” said Frundt when we visited Courtney’s House last summer. Frundt, who has helped hundreds of children like Maya since she opened Courtney’s House in 2008, says that the first thing she now does when a young person is referred to her is to ask for their Instagram handle. Other social media platforms are also used to exploit the young people in her care, but she says Instagram is the one that comes up most often. In the 20 years since the birth of social media, child sexual exploitation has become one of the biggest challenges facing tech companies. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the internet is used by human traffickers as “digital hunting fields”, allowing them access to both customers and potential victims, with children being targeted by traffickers on social media platforms. The biggest of these, Facebook, is owned by Meta, the tech giant whose platforms, which also include Instagram, are used by more than 3 billion people worldwide. In 2020, according to a report by US-based not-for-profit the Human Trafficking Institute, Facebook was the platform most used to groom and recruit children by sex traffickers (65%), based on an analysis of 105 federal child sex trafficking cases that year. The HTI analysis ranked Instagram second most prevalent, with Snapchat third. Grooming and child sex trafficking, though often researched and discussed together, are distinct acts. “Grooming” refers to the period of manipulation of a victim prior to their exploitation for sex or for other purposes. “Child sex trafficking” is the sexual exploitation of a child specifically as part of a commercial transaction. When the pimp was flattering and chatting with Maya, he was grooming her; when he was selling her to other adults for sex, he was trafficking. Though people often think of “trafficking” as the movement of victims across or within borders, under international law the term refers to the use of force, fraud or coercion to obtain labour, or in the buying and selling of non-consensual sex acts, whether or not travel is involved. Because, under international law, children cannot legally consent to any kind of sex act, anyone who profits from or pays for a sex act from a child – including profiting from or paying for photographs depicting sexual exploitation – is considered a human trafficker. Meta has numerous policies in place to try to prevent sex trafficking on its platforms. “It’s very important to me that everything we build is safe and good for kids,” Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder, wrote in a memo to staff in 2021. In a statement responding to a detailed list of the allegations in this piece, a Meta spokesperson said: “The exploitation of children is a horrific crime – we don’t allow it and we work aggressively to fight it on and off our platforms. We proactively aid law enforcement in arresting and prosecuting the criminals who perpetrate these grotesque offences. When we are made aware that a victim is in harm’s way, and we have data that could help save a life, we process an emergency request immediately.” The statement cited the group director of intelligence at the charity Stop the Traffik, who is former deputy director of the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency, who has said “millions are safer and traffickers are increasingly frustrated” because of their work with Meta. But over the past two years, through interviews, survivor testimonies, US court documents and human trafficking reporting data, we have heard repeated claims that Facebook and Instagram have become major sales platforms for child trafficking. We have interviewed more than 70 sources, including survivors and their relatives, prosecutors, child protection professionals and content moderators across the US in order to understand how sex traffickers are using Facebook and Instagram, and why Meta is able to deny legal responsibility for the trafficking that takes place on its platforms. While Meta says it is doing all it can, we have seen evidence that suggests it is failing to report or even detect the full extent of what is happening, and many of those we interviewed said they felt powerless to get the company to act. The survivors * * * Courtney’s House sits on a quiet residential street on the outskirts of Washington DC. Inside, Frundt and her team have tried to make the modest two-storey house feel like a family home, with comfortable sofas and photos on the mantlepiece. Frundt, who was herself trafficked as a child in the 1980s and 90s, is now one of Washington DC’s most experienced and respected anti-trafficking advocates. Warm and ferociously protective of the children in her care, she is contracted by the city’s child protection services to identify trafficked children going through the court system, and she regularly attends court hearings for the youth in her care. She also helps train the FBI and local law enforcement sex-trafficking units on how to spot traffickers on online platforms, including Instagram. “When I was trafficked long ago I was advertised in the classified sections of freesheet newspapers,” Frundt told us. “Now my youth here are trafficked on Instagram. It’s exactly the same business model but you just don’t have to pay to place an ad.” The children who are referred to Frundt, usually by the police or social services, have been sexually exploited and controlled: by a boyfriend, a pimp, a family member. Some of them are as young as nine. Almost without exception, they have childhoods scarred by sexual abuse, poverty and violence. This makes them perfect targets for sexual predators. “They are all looking for love and affirmation and a sense that they mean something,” said Frundt. Almost all the young people who come to Courtney’s House are children of colour. They are, Frundt said, battling stereotypes that pressure them to become sexualised too early and make them vulnerable to traffickers. A 2017 study by the Georgetown Law Center on Poverty and Inequality found that adults typically regard Black girls as less innocent and more knowledgable about sex than their white peers. The same study showed that Black girls are often perceived to be older than they are. Most of the time, Frundt says, the children who come to Courtney’s House are still being trafficked when they walk through the door. Even in cases where they have escaped their exploiters, she said, explicit videos and photos of them often continue to circulate online. Traffickers will lock victims out of their accounts, preventing them from taking down images posted to their profiles. When we asked Frundt if she could show us examples of young people in her care who she says are currently being trafficked on Instagram, she pulled out her phone and scrolled through post after post of explicit images and videos of girls as young as 14 or 15. Most of the photos and videos seemed to have been taken by someone else. Frundt said that these posts were being used as a way of advertising the girls for potential sex buyers, who would send a direct message to buy explicit content or to arrange a meet up. At one point, our conversation was interrupted by the arrival of five teenage girls. They had come back from school, and they gathered around the kitchen table, chatting and playing music on their phones while Frundt served them casserole. After they had eaten, we asked if we could talk to them about their experiences: had any of them been sexually exploited on social media or had explicit videos or pictures posted of them? They glanced at each other and burst out laughing. Yes, they said, of course. All the time. One girl said she felt that “nobody at Instagram cares, they don’t care what’s posted. They don’t care shit about us.” Frundt claims that she is constantly asking Instagram to close accounts and take down exploitative content of kids in her care. “I even have law enforcement calling me up asking, ‘Tina, can you get Instagram to do something?’. If I can’t get Instagram to act, what hope is there for anyone else?” When we put these concerns to Meta, a spokesperson said: “We take all allegations and reports of content involving children extremely seriously and have diligently responded to requests from Courtney’s House. Our ability to remove content or delete accounts requires sufficient information to determine that the content or user violates our policies.” Frundt says that in 2020 and 2021 she had discussions with Instagram about conducting staff training to help prevent child trafficking on its platforms. She says the training didn’t go ahead as, after a long back and forth, on a video call Instagram executives said that they wouldn’t pay Frundt her standard fee of $3,000, instead allegedly offering $300. When we put this to Meta, they did not deny it. The court documents and the prosecutors * * * What makes social media platforms so powerful as a tool for traffickers – far more powerful than the back pages of a newspaper in which Frundt was advertised as a teenager – is the way that they make it possible to identify and cultivate relationships with both victims and potential sex buyers. Traffickers can advertise and negotiate deals by using different features of the same platform: sellers sometimes post publicly about the girls they have available, and then switch to private direct messages to discuss prices and locations with buyers. US court documents provide a graphic insight into how these platforms can be used. In one case prosecuted in Arizona in 2019, Mauro Veliz, a 31-year-old who was convicted of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of a child, exchanged messages on Facebook Messenger with Miesha Tolliver, who also received jail time for sex trafficking. Tolliver told Veliz that she had one girl available for sex, and photographs of two more, before saying that the girls were aged 17, 16 and 14. Veliz: “How much is it for all of them?” Tolliver: “The 14 [year-old] will cost the most … a couple of hundred for her but [$] 150 for the rest” The 14-year-old, Tolliver told Veliz, was “new to the sex game”. Tolliver: “The 1 on the right … is 16 with a fat ass ... the other [is] 15 with huge tits” The court transcripts then state that multiple sexually explicit images of the girls were sent to Veliz. Tolliver: “do you want me to bring 1 of the girls with me so you guys can fuck?” [ ... ] Veliz: “is your girl nervous? Or have you told her yet?” Tolliver: “… shes still young and doesn’t understand how ppl like it” Tolliver and Veliz exchanged more messages, arranging for Veliz to meet the girl in a hotel in California two days later. The final message submitted to the court was from Veliz to Tolliver. “We’re finished she’s in the restroom,” it said. Luke Goldworm, a former assistant district attorney in Boston, Massachusetts, who has investigated and prosecuted human trafficking cases for years, says that he has encountered numerous exchanges like this one. From 2019 until he left the job in October 2022, he said, his department’s caseload of child-trafficking crimes on social media platforms increased by about 30% each year. “We’re seeing more and more people with significant criminal records move into this area. It’s incredibly lucrative,” he said. A trafficker can make up to $1,000 a night. Many of the victims he saw were just 11 or 12, he said, and most of them were Black, Latinx or LGBTQI+. According to Goldworm, while his investigations involved every social media platform, Meta platforms were the ones he encountered most often. Six other prosecutors in several different states told us that, in their experience, Facebook and Instagram are being widely used to groom children and traffick children. Five of these prosecutors spoke of their anger over what they felt were Meta’s unnecessary delays in complying with judge-signed warrants and subpoenas needed to gather evidence on sex trafficking cases. “We get a higher rate of rejected warrants from Facebook than any other electronic service provider,” claimed Gary Ernsdorff, senior deputy prosecuting attorney for King County, Washington state. “What I find frustrating is that the exchange can delay rescuing a victim by a month.” Three of these prosecutors described experiences where they say the company would cite technicalities, picking faults with wording and format, and slowing down investigations. In response, the company said that these claims were “false”, adding that between January and June last year, it “provided data in nearly 88% of requests from the US government”. The responsibility for reporting * * * Meta acknowledges that human traffickers use its platforms, but insists that it is doing everything in its power to stop them. By law, the company is required to report any child sexual abuse imagery shared over its platforms to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC), which receives federal funding to act as a nationwide clearing house for leads about child abuse. Meta is a major funder of NCMEC, and holds a seat on the company’s board. From January to September 2022, Facebook reported more than 73.3m pieces of content under “child nudity and physical abuse” and “child sexual exploitation” and Instagram reported 6.1m. “Meta leads the industry in using the most sophisticated technology to detect both known and previously unknown child exploitation content,” said a company spokesperson. Of the 34m pieces of child sexual exploitation content removed from Facebook and Instagram in the final three months of 2022, 98% was detected by Meta itself. But the vast majority of the content that Meta reports falls under child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) – which includes photos and videos of pornographic content – rather than sex trafficking. Unlike with child sexual abuse imagery, there is no legal requirement to report child sex trafficking, so NCMEC must rely on all social media companies to be proactive in searching for and reporting it. This legal inconsistency – the fact that child sexual abuse imagery must be reported, but reporting child sex trafficking is not legally required – is a major problem, says Staca Shehan, vice-president of the analytical services division at NCMEC. “It’s concerning across the board how little trafficking is being reported,” Shehan says. Social media companies “are prioritising what’s [legally] required”. “I think everyone could do more,” Shehan says. “The volume of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and volume of trafficking [being reported] is like apples and oranges.” According to Shehan, one further reason for this disparity, beyond the differing legal requirements, is technological. “Child sexual abuse material is that much easier to detect. There are so many technology tools that have been developed that allow for the automated detection of that crime.” A NCMEC spokesperson told us that if social media companies are not reporting child sex trafficking, it allows this crime to thrive online. Reporting trafficking, they emphasised, is crucial for rescuing victims and punishing offenders. Between 2009 and 2019, Meta reported just three cases as suspected child sex trafficking in the US to NCMEC, according to records disclosed in a subpoena request seen by the Guardian. A spokesperson for NCMEC confirmed this figure, but clarified that a number of child trafficking cases during the same time period were reported by Meta under other “incident types”, such as child pornography or enticement. “I think one of the things to be aware of is that is that there’s sort of a singular tag that’s used for reporting,” Antigone Davis, head of global safety at Meta, emphasised to us in a recent interview. “And so just because something isn’t tagged as sex trafficking doesn’t mean that it isn’t being reported.” A Meta spokesperson claimed that over the past decade, the company had reported “tens of thousands of accounts which violated our policies against child sex trafficking and commercial child sexual abuse material to NCMEC.” When we put these claims to NCMEC, it said that it had not received “tens of thousands” of reports of child trafficking from Meta, but had received that number related to child abuse imagery. Hany Farid is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley who helped invent the PhotoDNA technology that Meta uses to identify harmful content. He believes Meta, which is currently valued at more than $500bn, could do more to combat child trafficking. It could, for instance, be investing more to develop better tools to “flag suspicious words and phrases on unencrypted parts of the platform – including coded language around grooming,” he said. “This is, fundamentally, not a technological problem, but one of corporate priorities.” (There is a separate debate about how to handle encryption. Meta’s plans to encrypt direct messages on Facebook Messenger and Instagram has recently drawn criticism from law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and Interpol.) In response to Farid’s claims and further questions from the Guardian, Meta did not specify how much money it has invested in technologies to detect child sex trafficking, but said that it had “focused on using AI and machine learning on non-private, unencrypted parts of its platforms to identify harmful content and accounts and make it easier for people to report messages to the company so we can take action, including referrals to law enforcement”. Davis also emphasised that Meta constantly works with partners to improve its anti-trafficking safeguards. For instance, she mentioned that “we’ve been able to identify the kinds of searches that people do when they’re searching for trafficking content, so that when people search for that, we will pop up with information to divert them or to let them know that what they’re doing is illegal activity”. These efforts have failed to satisfy some of Meta’s own investors. In March, several pension and investment funds that own Meta stock launched legal action against the company in Delaware over its alleged failure to act on “systemic evidence” that its platforms are facilitating sex trafficking and child sexual exploitation. By offering insufficient explanation of how it is tackling these crimes, the complaint says, the board has failed to protect the interests of the company. Meta has rejected the basis for the lawsuit. “Our goal is to prevent people who seek to exploit others from using our platform,” the company said. The moderators * * * As well as software, Meta uses teams of human moderators to identify cases of child grooming and sex trafficking. Until recently, Anna Walker* worked the night shift in an office of a Meta subcontractor. She would start each shift filled with dread. “We were just, like, shoved in a dark room to look at the stuff,” she said. Walker’s job was to review interactions between adults and children on Facebook Messenger and Instagram direct messenger that had been flagged as suspicious by Meta’s AI software. Walker claims she and her team struggled to keep pace with the huge backlog of cases. She says she saw cases of adults grooming children and then making plans to meet them for sex, as well as discussions about payment in exchange for sex. Walker’s managers would pass on such cases to Meta to decide if action should be taken against the user. In some cases, Walker claims: “Months would pass and then the automatic bot would send me an email saying it was closing this case, because nobody’s taken action on it.” She added: “I would cry to my manager about [the children I saw] and how I want to help. But it felt like nobody would pay attention to these horrible things.” We talked to six other moderators who worked for companies that Meta subcontracted between 2016 and 2022. All made similar claims to Walker. Their efforts to flag and escalate possible child trafficking on Meta platforms often went nowhere, they said. “On one post I reviewed, there was a picture of this girl that looked about 12, wearing the smallest lingerie you could imagine,” said one former moderator. “It listed prices for different things explicitly, like, a blowjob is this much. It was obvious that it was trafficking,” she told us. She claims that her supervisor later told her no further action had been taken in this case. When we put these claims to Meta, a spokesperson said that moderators such as Walker do not typically get feedback on whether their flagged content has been escalated. They stressed that if a moderator does not hear back about a flagged case, that does not mean no action has been taken. Five of the moderators claimed that it was harder to get cases escalated or content taken down if it was posted on closed Facebook groups or Facebook Messenger. Meta “would be less stringent about something taking place behind ‘closed doors’,” claimed one team leader. “With Messenger, we really couldn’t make any moves unless the language and content was really obvious. If it was four guys who trusted each other and it was in a group it could just live on for ever.” Meta said these allegations “appear to be misleading and inaccurate” and said it uses technology to find child sexualisation content in private Facebook groups and on Messenger. In 2021, former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked internal documents that seem to support the moderators’ claims. These documents, which numbered thousands of pages, detailed how the company managed harmful content. In one memo from the Haugen leak, the company states that “Messenger groups with less than 32 people should be treated with a full expectation of privacy”. Matias Cruz*, who worked as a content moderator from 2018 to 2020, reviewing Spanish-language posts on Facebook, believes that the criteria that Meta was using to recognise trafficking was too narrow to keep up with traffickers, who would constantly switch codewords to avoid detection. According to Cruz, traffickers would say: “‘I have this cabra [Spanish for goat] for sale,’ and it’d be some really ridiculous price. Sometimes they would just outright say [the price] for a night or two, or ‘an hour’.” It was obvious what was going on, said Cruz, but “the managers would claim it was too vague, so in the end they would just leave it up”. Cruz and three other moderators we spoke to claimed that in examples like this, where their managers felt there was insufficient evidence to escalate the case, moderators could receive lower accuracy scores, which in turn would affect their performance assessments. “We would take negative hits on their accuracy scores to try to get some help to these people,” Cruz said. The limits of the law * * * While the law requires Meta to report any child exploitation imagery detected on its platforms, the company is not legally responsible for crimes that occur on its platform, because of a law created almost three decades ago, in the early days of the internet. In 1996, the US Congress passed the Communications Decency Act, which was primarily intended to ensure online pornographic content was regulated. But section 230 of the act states that providers of “interactive computer services” – which includes the owners of social media platforms and website hosts – should not be treated as the publisher of material posted by users. This section was included in the act to ensure the free flow of information while protecting the growing tech industry from being crushed by litigation. Whereas a newspaper, say, must legally defend what it publishes, section 230 means that a company like Meta, which hosts the content of others, may not be held liable for what appears on its platforms. Section 230 therefore positions internet service providers as fundamentally neutral: offering forums in which illegal, harmful or false content may be posted and circulated, but ultimately not responsible for that content. Since the passing of the act, tech companies such as Meta have argued successfully in courts across the US that section 230 provides them with complete immunity from prosecution for any illegal content published on their platforms, as long as they are unaware of that content’s existence. The debate around section 230 has become highly polarised. Those who want section 230 amended say that the legal safe harbour it has provided for internet companies means they have no incentive to root out illegal content on their sites. In an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal in January, President Biden spoke out in favour of the section’s reform. “I’ve long said we must fundamentally reform section 230,” he wrote, calling for “bipartisan action by Congress to hold big tech accountable.” However, tech companies, along with internet freedom groups, argue that changes to section 230 could lead to censorship and an erosion of privacy, particularly for private, encrypted content. These arguments over section 230 are being put to the test in a landmark case that has reached the US supreme court, which focuses on how far YouTube can be considered culpable for the videos it recommends to its users. A ruling is due by the end of June. The consequences * * * Kyle Robinson is one year into serving a 10-year sentence at a federal prison in Massachusetts for sex trafficking two teenagers, one only 14 years old. We spoke to him in January over the muffled line of the prison’s payphone, our conversation interrupted by prison staff monitoring the call. Referring to himself as a pimp, Robinson described how he sought out damaged girls from care homes and on social media as a way to make money. Instagram, he said, was his platform of choice. “I find the girls that have pride in themselves, but maybe don’t have the confidence, the self-esteem,” he claimed. “I make her feel special. I give her validation, social skills, her ‘hotential’, if you know what I mean.” Once he had identified his targets, Robinson claimed that he would “coach” them and advertise them on their Instagram accounts and his own. He would talk to potential buyers through direct messages, offering to send video snippets of the girls in return for “a small deposit” – about $20 – so that the buyers could see what they would be getting. If a buyer decided to meet a girl, he would pay her the rest of the money later, via CashApp, he said. Robinson would then take most of that money. To crack down on such cases of child sexual exploitation, last June Meta announced new policies including age verification software that will require users under 18 to provide proof of age through uploading an ID, recording a video selfie, or asking mutual friends on Facebook to confirm their age. When we asked Tina Frundt about these new measures, she was sceptical. The kids she works with had already found workarounds; a 14-year-old, for example, might use a video selfie made by her 18-year-old friend, and pretend that it’s her own. Even after children have been referred to Courtney’s House, they continue to be vulnerable to traffickers. One night in June 2021, Frundt says she got a call from Maya, telling her she had arrived home safe. Frundt was relieved: she knew that Maya had spent the evening with a 43-year-old man who had been contacting her on Instagram. Frundt says that Maya, now 15, was in a fragile state: over the previous few months, her mental health had been in sharp decline and she had told Frundt she’d been feeling suicidal. Photos and explicit videos taken by a pimp showing her having sex were being circulated and sold on Instagram. Sex buyers were contacting her relentlessly through her direct messages. “She didn’t know how to make it stop or how to say no,” Frundt recalled. That night, on the phone, Frundt told Maya that she loved her and that they would talk in the morning. “That’s the last time I ever spoke to her,” said Frundt. The older man had given Maya drugs. When Maya’s mother went to wake her daughter the next morning, she found her dead. A picture of Maya that still hangs on the wall of Courtney’s House shows a baby-faced teenage girl with brown curls and a huge smile. Two years after her death, Frundt continues to grieve for her caring “girly girl” who loved makeup, board games and dancing to her favourite Megan Thee Stallion songs. “Losing one of our youth, it changes you for ever. You can never forgive yourself,” she said. Before Maya died, Frundt claims she spoke to Instagram on a video call, asking them to remove the exploitative content her trafficker had circulated. Frundt says that when Maya died, the videos of her being exploited were still on the platform. In July 2021, a representative from an anti-trafficking organisation sent an email to Instagram’s head of youth policy, informing her of Maya’s death. Frundt was copied in on the email. It asked why Meta’s tools designed to detect grooming had not flagged a 43-year-old man contacting a young girl. Four days later, the company sent a brief reply. If Instagram was provided with details about the alleged trafficker’s account, it would investigate. But Frundt says that it was too late. “She had already passed,” she says. “They could have done something to help her but they didn’t. She was gone.” Names marked with an asterisk have been changed to preserve anonymity. • In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453.

4,instagram,Guardian,2023-04-20,Crime agencies condemn Facebook and Instagram encryption plans,"An alliance of the world’s most powerful law enforcement agencies including the FBI, Interpol and Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA) have condemned Meta’s plans to encrypt direct messages on Facebook Messenger and Instagram, saying that doing so will weaken the ability to keep child users safe. The Virtual Global Taskforce, made up of 15 agencies, is chaired by the NCA and also includes Europol and the Australian federal police among its membership. The VGT has spoken out, it says, owing to the “impending design choices” by Meta, which it says could cause serious harm. The decision to encrypt direct messages on the platforms, which would prevent anyone other than the intended recipient being able to intercept the communications, “is an example of a purposeful design choice that degrades safety systems and weakens the ability to keep child users safe”, the alliance said. The VGT praised Meta’s work with the American National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which acts as a clearing house for reports on online child sexual abuse. Meta reported more such cases to the NCMEC than any other provider, the alliance said, but it feared that lead would disappear once the messages are “end-to-end encrypted” (E2EE). “The VGT has not yet seen any indication from Meta that any new safety systems implemented post-E2EE will effectively match or improve their current detection methods,” it said. Citing the case of David Wilson, who was jailed in 2021 for abusing 52 children, the VGT predicted similar arrests could prove impossible with encryption enabled. “The successful prosecution of Wilson and the resulting safeguarding of hundreds of children was possible because law enforcement were able to access the evidence contained within over 250,000 messages through Facebook. In an E2EE environment, it is highly unlikely this case would have been detected.” In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said: “The overwhelming majority of Brits already rely on apps that use encryption. We don’t think people want us reading their private messages, so have developed safety measures that prevent, detect and allow us to take action against this heinous abuse, while maintaining online privacy and security. “As we continue to roll out our end-to-end encryption plans, we remain committed to working with law enforcement and child safety experts to ensure that our platforms are safe for young people. “In the case of David Wilson, we submitted Cybertips to authorities using both public and private information,” the spokesperson added. “We have developed detection systems using behavioural signals and other account activity that are not reliant on the content of private messages to identify malicious actors like David Wilson. It’s misleading and inaccurate to say that encryption would have prevented us from identifying and reporting accounts like David Wilson’s to the authorities.” Plans to encrypt all messages on Meta’s platforms were first revealed in 2019, when the company was still called Facebook. But they have been delayed a number of times, because of technical hurdles and regulatory pressure. In April 2021, the company announced the integration would not happen until 2022 at the earliest, before pushing the deadline back to 2023 in November 2021. “We’re taking our time to get this right,” Meta’s head of safety, Antigone Davis, said when the latest delay was announced. “As a company that connects billions of people around the world and has built industry-leading technology, we’re determined to protect people’s private communications and keep people safe online.” But in the years since, Meta has given few details on how the push to encrypt communications by default would avoid harsh trade-offs against its existing child safety practices. Davis said Meta would be able to detect abuse by using non-encrypted data, account information and reports from users. Meta’s third messaging platform, WhatsApp, already uses a similar approach to tackle child sexual abuse but makes far fewer referrals to NCMEC as a result. In March 2022, the non-profit released data showing Facebook made 22m reports of online exploitation of children in 2021, while WhatsApp made just 1.3m. Other encrypted platforms with similar user bases were even worse: Apple, which runs iMessage, reported just 160 cases. VGT’s intervention comes two days after WhatsApp joined forces with other encrypted messaging apps, including its rival Signal, to call on the UK government to protect E2EE in the online safety bill.

5,instagram,Guardian,2023-04-18,Donald Trump returns to Instagram for first time since Capitol attack,"Donald Trump returned to Instagram on Tuesday, posting for the first time since 5 January 2021, the day before the former US president incited the deadly attack on Congress which led to his suspension from major social media platforms. Trump, who is now running to regain the White House, used his return to Instagram to promote a second edition of his digital trading cards, a project widely mocked when he announced it in December but which sold out an edition of 44,000 in less than a day, netting $4.5m. Trump has already enjoyed a fundraising boost this month, centered on his criminal indictment in New York on 34 charges of falsification of business records, all relating to his hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, an adult film star who claims an affair. The parent company of Instagram and Facebook, Meta, lifted its ban on Trump in January. Meta’s president of global affairs, the former British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, said then there would be “new guardrails in place to deter repeat offenses”. “In the event that Mr Trump posts further violating content,” Clegg said, “the content will be removed and he will be suspended for between one month and two years, depending on the severity of the violation.” On Tuesday, Trump’s first post back on Instagram announced the second series of cards alongside an image of him holding the Liberty Bell against a sunset and the Stars and Stripes. In his second post, a picture of himself as a superhero in red spandex and wearing the US flag as a cape, Trump wrote: “I hope everyone notices, and I’m sure the Fake News won’t, that I’m leaving the price of the Trading Cards the same as last time.” He also claimed he “could have raised the price MUCH HIGHER, and I believe it still would have sold well, with a lot more money coming to me, but I didn’t choose to do so. I WILL BE GIVEN NO ‘NICE GUY’ CREDIT?” Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter, lifted its Trump ban in November. Trump has not returned, instead using Truth Social, the platform he set up after January 6. As well as the New York indictment, Trump faces legal jeopardy over the events of January 6, his election subversion, his handling of classified material, his business affairs and an allegation of rape. Denying all wrongdoing, he remains the clear leader in polling regarding the Republican nomination for president. Trump’s last Instagram post before his ban was an announcement of his speech near the White House on 6 January 2021. The House January 6 committee has shown that Trump knew members of the crowd were armed, but still told supporters to march on the Capitol and “fight like hell” to overturn his election defeat. Mark Bowden and Matt Teague, authors of The Steal: The Attempt to Overturn the 2020 Election and the People Who Stopped It, contend that the rioters “had no more chance of overthrowing the US government than hippies in 1967 had trying to levitate the Pentagon”. But nine deaths are now linked to the riot, including law enforcement suicides. Trump was impeached a second time, for inciting an insurrection. Escaping conviction, as enough Republican senators stayed loyal, he remains eligible to return to the Oval Office.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/18/donald-trump-instagram-social-media
6,instagram,Guardian,2023-04-14,"Bold, brash and easy to grow – the dahlia’s Instagram reign is never over ","There’s one flower whose relevance in the zeitgeist fascinates me beyond all others: the dahlia. Bold, brash, blooms as big as your head, they can command devotion bordering on obsession among some flower-growers, especially – and intriguingly – among the relatively inexperienced gardener. This is, I think, because they can be straightforward to grow, and look good on Instagram. I suspect in some gardens dahlias have never been out of fashion. However, they’ve certainly enjoyed a prolonged moment over the past decade. A couple of summers ago, though, I chaired a panel with experts Sarah Raven and Arthur Parkinson, who admitted to being a bit fed up with the cream-coloured queen of Pinterest, dahlia “Café au Lait”. This, combined with their absence during the one-off September Chelsea flower show a few months later, had me convinced the dahlia’s millennial reign was over. Nevertheless, they persevere on Instagram – and life is too short to grow flowers according to trends. I mention all this because now’s the time to get cracking if you want flowers this summer (and autumn, and maybe even winter) and haven’t bought tubers. Dahlias begin as tubers: funny, potatoey and indeed edible little rhizomes indigenous to Central America, where they were a food crop before European colonists turned up. The Aztec name for them is acocoxochitl, which refers to the stems’ abilities to carry water. In the UK, those who ordered their dahlias last year will have received them a couple of months ago. More assertive gardeners will have planted them in pots, kept them ever so slightly moist – they are prone to rot – and somewhere warm and bright, such as a greenhouse (or my south-facing front room). Last year, I planted tubers in pots outside in mid-May. They leafed up quickly and, while I didn’t have the world’s greatest display, I did get some flowers. Better, then, at this time of year, to be picking up ones someone else has started off for you. Nurseries such as Halls of Heddon, which has marked its 60th anniversary by going peat-free, will dispatch “mini plants”, which can be planted into 12cm pots around now – and garden-ready dahlias from June. The arrival of its catalogue in the depths of December is one of my favourite annual traditions, the combination of old-school graphic design, bright colour and preposterous variety names (‘Crazy 4 Don’, ‘Deborah’s Kiwi’) brightening up long nights. If you’re shopping for varieties for the first time, make sure to check the height as much as the colour: dahlias can be big plants that need staking as the season goes on. After a couple of summers of deadheading and preening, I’m keeping any I grow in pots (‘Waltzing Mathilda’ is lovely against autumnal sunlight, ‘Moonfire’ has chic black stems and ‘Tally Ho’ is imbued with retro charm), where they won’t take up too much space for other perennials. I’m sure I’ll see plenty on the ’gram.",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/14/dahlias-grow-the-insta-favourite-thats-never-out-of-fashion
7,instagram,Guardian,2023-02-28,‘Professional adverts’ for county lines ensnaring children on Instagram and Snapchat ,"County lines adverts on Instagram and Snapchat designed to groom children and young people now resemble professional job adverts, a parliamentary committee heard on Tuesday. Experts from charities gave evidence to Tuesday’s cross-party education committee about the constantly evolving scene, with traffickers frequently changing their methods of ensnaring children and young people. Johnny Bolderson, manager at the organisation Catch 22, which helps to support and rescue children and young people groomed into county lines exploitation, told the committee that children as young as seven were now getting involved in drug running. He said: “Social media platforms need to take more responsibility. Adverts on Instagram and Snapchat for young people to get involved in county lines look professionally done – ‘recruitment opportunities available’. That has been growing in the last six months. Since Covid, families are struggling, and with really professional advertising young people think they are going to help out their families.” The committee heard that London, West Midlands, Manchester and Merseyside were four of the main areas for county lines activity, and that thousands of children and young people were getting pulled in every year. Rebecca Griffiths, head of the National Counter-Trafficking Service at Barnardo’s, said that the charity had received 300 referrals from various parts of England and Wales in the past three months. “Vulnerability is changing all the time. We are seeing much younger children and the modus operandi of traffickers is changing. They are targeting more affluent children. Every child can be exploited criminally,” she said. Some girls have been forced to take on “debts” for their boyfriends they are expected to repay. Children can be given free vapes along with bicycles, sweets, magazines or even free sandwiches to entice them to get involved with county lines groomers. Iryna Pona, policy and impact manager at the Children’s Society, said: “Vaping is a way of grooming.” According to Bolderson, children can also be reeled in through online gaming platforms where groomers befriend them in internet gaming chatrooms, give them coins to enable them to play more games. The children then owe a debt and find themselves in ‘debt bondage’ to the groomers. He said children could be groomed without leaving their bedrooms. Susannah Drury, director of policy and development at the charity Missing People, told the committee that it was partly a public health issue, with a cross-government approach required and children benefiting from early intervention. Of the county lines traffickers’ approach, she said: “This is a business model that’s very fluid, very reactive, very agile.” The National Crime Agency has called county lines exploitation “the most frequently identified form of coerced criminality, with children representing the vast majority of victims”. The Home Office’s 2020 Drugs Review by Dame Carol Black found strong associations between young people being drawn into county lines and increases in child poverty, the numbers of children in care and school exclusions.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/28/county-lines-grooming-looks-like-professional-job-ads-on-social-media
8,instagram,Guardian,2023-02-20,Does paid-for Facebook and Instagram signal end of free-access orthodoxy?,"Mark Zuckerberg’s social media empire is built on billions of users – and the advertisers who pay vast sums to grab their attention. But that business model is under pressure on several fronts. It is against this backdrop that Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said on Sunday it is trialling subscriptions for both social media platforms. “Advertising has paid for editorial content and other things for centuries,” says Johnny Ryan, a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and a campaigner for stronger protection of internet users’ data. “I do not see that changing. But the tracking-based ads that snoop on our every move are the historical anomaly, and they are on the way out.” Facebook and Instagram offer a goldmine of user data for advertisers. Facebook alone has 2 billion daily users, while across all of Meta’s platforms including Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger the total is just under 3 billion. Facebook generates revenue from building profiles of those users and matching them with advertisers, who direct ads at people targeting their specific interests and background. This advertising-based model accounted for 98% of Meta’s $116.6bn in revenues last year, but it faces problems. In 2021, Apple introduced privacy changes that required apps sold on the Apple store to ask users permission to track their activity across other apps and the internet – a key means of gathering data for targeted adverts. Of course, many users have opted not to be tracked, and Meta warned that the change would reduce its 2022 ad revenue by $10bn. Regulators loom as well. Last month Meta’s business model was dealt a blow by a ruling that the company’s legal justification for targeting users with personalised ads broke EU data laws. Meta said the ruling did not prevent targeted or personalised advertising, but it is very clear what the EU, which is a highly influential tech regulator, thinks about Meta’s user data-oriented business model. Then there is general economic weakness, to which any advertising-dependent social media or search company is susceptible. In its most recent quarterly results, Meta reported a 4% drop in revenue while other platforms, including Snap, Google and Elon Musk’s Twitter, have also warned of a weak advertising environment. Musk has launched a revamped Twitter subscription service to offset the company reliance on advertising, although its ad business has also suffered self-inflicted blows. Dan Ives, an analyst at the US financial services firm Wedbush Securities, says launching a subscription service is an obvious response to challenges that have already resulted in Meta announcing plans to cut 11,000 jobs. “Meta is seeing clear headwinds on the digital advertising model and this is a low-hanging-fruit way to potentially pick up some incremental revenue,” he says. Under the Meta Verified offering, users will pay a monthly subscription fee – $14.99 for people using the Facebook or Instagram app on an Apple iPhone or an Android phone, with a lower charge of $11.99 for web access – to enjoy features including: a verified badge on your account, certified by a piece of government ID; a monitoring service to deter account impersonators; increased visibility and reach for your account, such as in search and recommendations; and personal support for problems with your account. It is being tested in Australia and New Zealand and Meta says it hopes to bring the new product to the rest of the world “soon”. An obvious market for the service is the creators and influencers who use Meta’s platforms, particularly Instagram. Meta says it will help “up and coming” creators, adding that “subscribers with a smaller following may see a more noticeable impact to their reach”. Kat Molesworth, co-founder of the Creator Union, which hopes to start recruiting members this year, says Meta should not be charging for services she suggests should come as standard: “I would question if it’s appropriate to charge creators, who contribute to Meta’s massive profits, for basic features.” Referring to Google-owned YouTube’s practice of sharing advertising proceeds with creators, she adds: “YouTube shares revenues pretty much 50/50 with its creators and has done for over a decade. YouTube recognises that without creators it would not have an ad business.” On Sunday, Musk described Meta’s move as “inevitable”; although whether it is destined to succeed, after nearly two decades of free-access orthodoxy at Zuckerberg’s business, is a different matter.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/20/facebook-instagram-paid-for-signal-free-access-meta

His mother, Jennifer Miller, has since “persisted” to obtain answers from various government agencies about the circumstances surrounding her son’s debt, including writing to the former human services minister Alan Tudge, whose response said his department had acted appropriately in the case with only some “minor” errors.

10,instagram,Guardian,2023-02-20,Facebook and Instagram to get paid verification as Twitter charges for two-factor SMS authentication,"Facebook and Instagram users will soon need to pay to be verified on the social media platforms, as Meta follows in the footsteps of rival platform Twitter. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, announced in a Facebook post on Sunday that the service would first roll out in Australia and New Zealand later this week. The company said it would cost US$11.99 a month on web or US$14.99 on iOS and Android (or, in Australia, $19.99 on web or $24.99 on iOS and Android). Zuckerberg said in addition to a blue badge the service would offer “extra impersonation protection”, improved reach for verified users and direct access to customer support. In a blog post, Meta said it would rely on government ID documents to prove the identity of verified accounts, to avoid the embarrassment of accounts impersonating people and brands – as happened when Twitter initially rolled out its paid verification service. Accounts must also have a posting history and users must be at least 18 years old. The service would not be available to businesses at this stage, Meta said. The increased visibility of posts from verified users would “depend on a subscriber’s existing audience size and the topic of their posts”, the company said. Those with smaller audiences might see more of an impact. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The company said it would also offer “exclusive stickers” on Facebook and Instagram stories and Facebook reels. Meta cut 11,000 staff in November – the equivalent of 13% of its workforce – amid falling ad revenue and economic downturn. The company’s share price fell by more than 70% in 2022 before a rebound and in July it reported its first ever fall in revenue. Twitter’s CEO, Elon Musk, responded to the news in a tweet saying it was “inevitable” Meta would follow Twitter. Twitter restricts SMS two-factor authentication to paid accounts Separately, Twitter announced on Friday it would provide SMS-based two-factor authentication only to users who are subscribed to the US$8-a-month ($11.65) Twitter Blue service from 20 March. The company currently provides free two-factor authentication through third-party apps and a security key, which are considered more secure than SMS-based systems. If non-subscriber accounts that use SMS authentication do not switch before the deadline, Twitter said it would disable two-factor authentication for that account. The move has sparked concerns that it could lead to widespread hacks on accounts next month if they fail to switch over. Twitter’s last transparency report prior to Musk’s takeover shows that as of December 2021, although just 2.6% of active Twitter accounts use two-factor authentication, 74.4% of those use SMS as their method of authentication. Musk has claimed Twitter was being “scammed” US$60m a year from fake two-factor authentication messages. He separately supported a tweet claiming the scams were being run by telecommunications companies that had set up bot accounts to run the two-factor authentication process to get revenue from the text messages from Twitter.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/20/facebook-instagram-paid-meta-verification-twitter-charge-2fa-two-factor-authentication-via-sms
11,instagram,Guardian,2023-02-03,"Scams: FCA blocks more than 10,000 ads from Instagram, Facebook and YouTube","More than 10,000 misleading financial promotions and scams aimed at consumers via social media sites such as Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok have been identified and targeted by the financial watchdog during the past year. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the use of social media marketing channels and the rise of so-called “fin-fluencers” – particularly directing investment products at younger age groups – exploded last year, resulting in a record number of takedown notices and alerts. The FCA ordered businesses to amend or remove 8,582 promotions during 2022, 15 times the 573 recorded the previous year. It also published almost 1,900 alerts to consumers about potential scammers, up more than a third up on 2021. Google, which owns YouTube, Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, TikTok, Twitter and Microsoft’s Bing have changed advertising policies to ensure that regulated firms are involved in adverts for financial products after FCA intervention. However, the regulator said it was still monitoring whether the companies were effectively blocking illegal adverts. “More needs to be done by tech companies to protect consumers,” the FCA said. “Given the substantial number of illegal promotions we continue to identify, our expectation is that every social media platform improves their capability to identify and remove the illegal financial promotions on a proactive basis.” The crackdown included taking action against a company that attempted to take advantage of the cost of living crisis, targeting more than 70,000 online followers that the FCA deemed were potentially vulnerable consumers. An online retail broker with more than 1.1 million UK customers, with a primary market of millennial age investors, was ordered to halt a marketing campaign after the FCA identified “serious concerns” that its promotions, which used social media influencers, were “targeting vulnerable customers with significant debt”. The FCA also sought to get an unregistered cryptocurrency exchange offering products to UK consumers to be shut down, and separately alerted 55 consumers who had been identified on a scammers list targeting consumers who had been searching for loans online. “Financial promotions must be fair, clear and not misleading,” said Sarah Pritchard, executive director, markets, at the FCA. “This year, we will continue to put pressure on people using social media to illegally promote investments, which put people’s hard-earned money at risk.” The FCA said advances in the technology it uses to identify problem firms and misleading adverts had also fuelled the increase in cases last year. It has hired more than 100 people in roles such as machine learning and data analysis to build automated tools to scan thousands of websites every day. The watchdog said it looked at about 180,000 websites last year, resulting in about 4,500 websites and social media platforms being reviewed. This resulted in 1,441 alerts being issued and 400 of the offending websites being taken down. Last year, the Advertising Standards Authority sent enforcement notices to 50 firms in the cryptocurrency sector warning them that they must clearly explain the risks for potential investors. The watchdog slapped bans on a bitcoin firm for urging that it was “time to buy” or miss out, and on football club Arsenal’s campaign to get fans to buy its crypto “tokens”.",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/feb/03/scams-fca-blocks-more-than-10000-ads-from-instagram-facebook-and-youtube
12,instagram,Guardian,2023-01-26,"Trump’s Facebook and Instagram ban to be lifted, Meta announces","In a highly anticipated decision, Meta has said it will allow Donald Trump back on Facebook and Instagram following a two-year ban from the platforms over his online behavior during the 6 January insurrection. Meta will allow Trump to return “in coming weeks” but “with new guardrails in place to deter repeat offenses”, Meta’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, wrote in a blogpost explaining the decision. “Like any other Facebook or Instagram user, Mr Trump is subject to our community standards,” Clegg wrote. “In the event that Mr Trump posts further violating content, the content will be removed and he will be suspended for between one month and two years, depending on the severity of the violation.” Trump was removed from Meta platforms following the Capitol riots on 6 January 2021, during which he posted unsubstantiated claims that the election had been stolen, praised increasingly violent protesters and condemned former vice-president Mike Pence even as the mob threatened his life. Clegg said the suspension was “an extraordinary decision taken in extraordinary circumstances” and that Meta has weighed “whether there remain such extraordinary circumstances that extending the suspension beyond the original two-year period is justified”. Ultimately, the company has decided that its platforms should be available for “open, public and democratic debate” and that users “should be able to hear from a former President of the United States, and a declared candidate for that office again”, he wrote. “The public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying – the good, the bad and the ugly – so that they can make informed choices at the ballot box,” he said. While it is unclear if the former president will begin posting again on the platform, his campaign indicated he had a desire to return in a letter sent to Meta in January. “We believe that the ban on President Trump’s account on Facebook has dramatically distorted and inhibited the public discourse,” the letter said. Safety concerns and a politicized debate The move is likely to influence how other social media companies will handle the thorny balance of free speech and content moderation when it comes to world leaders and other newsworthy individuals, a debate made all the more urgent by Trump’s run for the US presidency once again. Online safety advocates have warned that Trump’s return will result in an increase of misinformation and real-life violence. Since being removed from Meta-owned platforms, the former president has continued to promote baseless conspiracy theories elsewhere, predominantly on his own network, Truth Social. While widely expected, the decision still drew sharp rebukes from civil rights advocates. “Facebook has policies but they under-enforce them,” said Laura Murphy, an attorney who led a two-year long audit of Facebook concluding in 2020. “I worry about Facebook’s capacity to understand the real world harm that Trump poses: Facebook has been too slow to act.” The Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Free Press and other groups also expressed concern on Wednesday over Facebook’s ability to prevent any future attacks on the democratic process, with Trump still repeating his false claim that he won the 2020 presidential election. “With the mass murders in Colorado or in Buffalo, you can see there is already a cauldron of extremism that is only intensified if Trump weighs in,” said Angelo Carusone, president and CEO of media watchdog Media Matters for America. “When Trump is given a platform, it ratchets up the temperature on a landscape that is already simmering – one that will put us on a path to increased violence.” After the 6 January riots, the former president was also banned from Twitter, Snapchat and YouTube. Some of those platforms have already allowed Trump to return. Twitter’s ban, while initially permanent, was later overruled by its new chief executive, Elon Musk. YouTube has not shared a timeline on a decision to allow Trump to return. Trump remains banned from Snapchat. Meta, however, dragged out its ultimate decision. In 2021, CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained in a post that Trump had been barred from the platforms for encouraging violence and that he would remain suspended until a peaceful transition of power could take place. While Zuckerberg did not initially offer a timeline on the ban, the company punted its decision about whether to remove him permanently to its oversight board: a group of appointed academics and former politicians meant to operate independently of Facebook’s corporate leadership. That group ruled in May 2021 that the penalties should not be “indeterminate”, but kicked the final ruling on Trump’s accounts back to Meta, suggesting it decide in six months – two years after the riots. The deadline was initially slated for 7 January, and reports from inside Meta suggested the company was intensely debating the decision. Clegg wrote in a 2021 blogpost that Trump’s accounts would need to be strictly monitored in the event of his return. How the ‘guardrails’ could work Announcing the decision on Wednesday, Clegg said Meta’s “guardrails” would include taking action against content that does not directly violate their community standards but “contributes to the sort of risk that materialized on January 6th, such as content that delegitimizes an upcoming election or is related to QAnon”. Meta “may limit the distribution of such posts, and for repeated instances, may temporarily restrict access to our advertising tools”, Clegg said, or “remove the re-share button” from posts. Trump responded to the news with a short statement on Truth Social, reposted by others on Twitter, saying that “such a thing should never happen again to a sitting president” but did not indicate if or when he would return to the platform. It remains to be seen if he will actually begin posting again on the platforms where his accounts have been reinstated. While he initially suggested he would be “staying on Truth [Social]”, his own social media platform, recent reports said he was eager to return to Facebook, formally appealing to Meta to reinstate his accounts. But weeks after returning to Twitter, Trump had yet to tweet again. Some have suggested the silence has been due to an exclusivity agreement he has with Truth Social. A report from Rolling Stone said Trump planned to begin tweeting again when the agreement, which requires him to post all news to the app six hours in advance of any other platform, expires in June. Trump has a far broader reach on mainstream social platforms compared with Truth Social, where he has just 5 million followers. Many online safety advocates have warned Trump’s return would be toxic, and Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill urged Meta in a December letter to uphold the ban. Representative Adam Schiff, a Democrat who previously chaired the House intelligence committee, criticized the decision to reinstate him. “Trump incited an insurrection,” Schiff wrote on Twitter. “Giving him back access to a social media platform to spread his lies and demagoguery is dangerous.” Trump’s account has remained online even after his ban, but he had been unable to publish new posts. Civil rights groups say that regardless of the former president’s future actions the Meta decision marks a dangerous precedent. “Whether he uses the platforms or not, a reinstatement by Meta sends a message that there are no real consequences even for inciting insurrection and a coup on their channels,” said a group of scholars, advocates and activists calling itself the Real Facebook Oversight Board in a statement. “Someone who has violated their terms of service repeatedly, spread disinformation on their platforms and fomented violence would be welcomed back.” Reuters contributed reporting",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/25/trump-facebook-ban-lifted-unbanned-instagram-meta-pages-latest
13,instagram,Guardian,2023-01-18,Free the nipple: Facebook and Instagram told to overhaul ban on bare breasts,"Facebook and Instagram’s parent company could soon free the nipple. More than a decade after breastfeeding mothers first held a “nurse-in” at Facebook’s headquarters to protest against its ban on breasts, Meta’s oversight board has called for an overhaul to the company’s rules banning bare-chested images of women – but not men. In a decision dated 17 January, the oversight board – a group of academics, politicians, and journalists who advise the company on its content-moderation policies – recommended that Meta change its adult nudity and sexual activity community standard “so that it is governed by clear criteria that respect international human rights standards”. The oversight board’s ruling follows Facebook’s censorship of two posts from an account run by an American couple who are transgender and non-binary. The posts showed the couple posing topless, but with their nipples covered, with captions describing trans healthcare and raising money for top surgery. The posts were flagged by users, then reviewed and removed by an AI system. After the couple appealed the decision, Meta eventually restored the posts. The board found that “the policy is based on a binary view of gender and a distinction between male and female bodies”, which makes rules against nipple-baring “unclear” when it comes to intersex, non-binary and transgender users. It recommended that Meta “define clear, objective, rights-respecting criteria” when it comes to moderating nudity “so that all people are treated in a manner consistent with international human rights standards”. “Lactivists” spent the 2000s attempting to squash the image of breasts as inherently sexual, and the campaign to #FreetheNipple went mainstream in 2013. The phrase entered pop-feminist parlance in 2013 after Facebook took down clips from the actor/director Lina Esco’s documentary Free the Nipple. The campaign gained wide support on college campuses and was championed by celebrities including Rihanna, Miley Cyrus and Lena Dunham. As recently as last week, Florence Pugh addressed wearing a sheer, hot pink Valentino gown on the red carpet, saying: “Of course, I don’t want to offend people, but I think my point is: how can my nipples offend you that much?” In 2015, the Los Angeles-based artist Micol Hebron created stickers of male nipples – which are permitted on Instagram – so that female Instagram users could superimpose them over their own to mock the disparity. Hebron was invited to Instagram’s headquarters in 2019 with a group of influencers to talk about the company’s nipple policy. “During that meeting, we learned that there were no transgender people on the content moderation policy team, and I also observed that there were no gender-neutral bathrooms there,” Hebron said. “To me, that was all I needed to know to understand the conversation of gender and inclusivity was not being had at Meta.” A Meta representative disputed Hebron’s characterization of the event, adding: “Much has changed since 2019.” But Hebron said she was “excited” that the oversight board had taken up the issue of gender and sex-based discrimination. “Beyond just ‘let’s let women be topless’, which is not at all my interest, I think it’s really important to hold on to the goal of allowing all bodies to have autonomy,” Hebron said. “It sounds so frivolous to a lot of people to talk about nipples, but if you think about the ways that governments around the world try to control and repress female-identifying bodies, trans bodies or non-binary bodies, it’s not.” Meta “welcomes the board’s decision in this case”, a representative said in a statement that noted that the couple’s photos had been reinstated “prior to the decision”. “We are constantly evolving our policies to help make our platforms safer for everyone,” the spokesperson added. “We know more can be done to support the LGBTQ+ community, and that means working with experts and LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations on a range of issues and product improvements.” Meta has 60 days to respond publicly to the board’s recommendations. While advocates may welcome the idea of a freer nipple online, questions remain about how Meta’s automated content-moderation systems will be able to enforce a new policy on nipples. A couple fundraising to afford top surgery is not the same as someone soliciting sex online, but the company’s AI did not recognize the difference in the post at first. So how will these systems be able to tell the difference between a topless post and porn? “Context is everything, and algorithms are terrible at context,” Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism, told the Guardian. “The interesting question will be the tension over how Meta can create new rules without opening the floodgates to porn, which is why those rules exist in the first place. That ought to be possible, but I’m skeptical of whether it is if content moderation is automated.” (Bell previously held several positions at the Guardian, including non-executive director of the Scott Trust.) Facebook and Instagram users can also flag posts they believe violate the company’s policies, as they did for the photo that spurred the board’s decision. “It doesn’t take a genius to work out that there are certain areas of the culture wars where content moderation gets weaponized,” Bell said. “A post about top surgery should not have been flagged in the first place, but it was. This could have been the actions of an anti-trans bad actor.” Jillian York, an activist and director of international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, added that it was “tricky” for companies that use AI to make the right decision in every scenario. “For instance, it’s not easy for an automated technology to make a decision about who is a topless adult, versus who is a topless child,” she said. “AI may be able to make a determination between a nine-year-old and a 26-year-old, but what about a 17-year-old and an 18-year-old?” Sarah Murnen, the Samuel B Cummings II professor of psychology at Kenyon College, said the Free the Nipple movement had once centered white, cisgender women – but that was changing. “When we talked about this as an issue about cis women, it seemed less important, potentially, than it is now with trans people wanting to be open about their bodies, while anti-trans sentiment is at an all-time-high,” she said. Now, Meta has been advised to loosen the restrictive, binary way it polices bodies online. But many are quick to doubt AI’s potential to protect all users. “That’s the big lesson of all of this: when you create automated systems, you’re going to have consequences for people who are more marginalized, or the minority in society,” said Bell. “Those are the people who are penalized by the application of an algorithm.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/17/free-the-nipple-meta-facebook-instagram
14,instagram,Guardian,2022-11-25,Met monitoring song lyrics of rap artist it tried to censor on Instagram,"Since being released from prison on licence last October, drill artist Chinx (OS), from the Regent’s Park Estate in north-west London, has written 17 music tracks. Each one could have sent the 24-year-old, desperate not to fall back into his past life after serving four years of an eight-year sentence for possession of a firearm with intent to harm, back to jail. This week, the oversight board at Meta, the owner of Instagram, overruled a decision by the social media platform, made in January on the request of the Met police, to delete one of Chinx’s tracks, Secrets not Safe, from the site. His own Instagram account was also deleted. In a development that hit the headlines, the board found that Scotland Yard’s claim to Instagram that the track could lead to “retaliatory violence” was not founded, adding that basic principles of free speech, equality and transparency had been breached in allowing a police operation to censor a musician in secret. But Chinx, who has asked for his real name not to be used, says the story does not stop there. “They’ve given me new licence conditions which are to notify the police and probation service within 24 hours of any release, yeah, and to also have lyrics attached to that,” the young musician says, speaking from an estate in St John’s Wood, north London. “There’s no approval phase. So, it’s not like I send in my lyrics and they say yeah, and you can release this. It is just you have to let us know, deliver the tunes out and if you mess up, you mess up.” He goes on: “A second condition is to not incite or encourage what is reasonably seen as inciting violence around gang hostility. Quite broad. It’s not really fair. ‘Reasonably seen’ is whatever the police see as a problem.” A misstep could lead to four more years in jail. The case highlights the unprecedented approach taken by the state to drill, a form of rap music that originated from the streets of Chicago, and is notable for its focus on violence and its dark provocative lyrics, fast beats and haunting melodies. In 2019, drill rappers Skengdo and AM were given suspended prison sentences for performing a song in a particular postcode and containing certain lyrics. As part of its investigation into the removal of the track, Meta’s oversight board found that the Met had filed 286 requests to take down or review posts about drill music in the 12 months from June 2021, and that 255 of those had resulted in the removal of content. The police contend that, rather than over-policing a form of music enjoyed predominantly by young black men, they are trying to keep them safe. Chinx, while recognising the excesses of some, says he is just trying to turn his life around and this music, reflecting on the life he knows, offers him a chance. Chinx, nicknamed after his resemblance to a US drill artist of the same name, had 12 convictions to his name before being arrested for possession of a Walther P38 pistol in 2017. He spent four years in seven prisons, including HMPs Belmarsh and Wormwood Scrubs. He performs with his face covered, and maintains anonymity as he seeks to keep his music and family life separate. But he wants, he says, to stay away from the lifestyle he once had on north London’s Regent Park Estate. It is why he is churning out his music despite the perilous restrictions encircling him. “Every moment counts,” he says. “That’s my mindset. I’ve been behind so I’ve got to do what I’ve got to do three or four times harder.” His work, he says, is entertainment, no matter the violence. The track that was deleted by Instagram was largely fiction. His other works, including those due to appear on a forthcoming album out next February, reflect on his life in jail. How, he asks, is the celebration of violence in Hollywood movies any different to his own? “To me, it is similar to a James Bond film,” he says. “James Bond is an MI5 officer who does contract killings. Yeah. So I mean, that’s his job as a profession when you make a whole movie out of it and make it seem like it’s cool to go around killing. All you can control is what you can control – me as an individual. I can’t control what someone else is going to do based on my lyrics.”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/25/met-monitoring-song-lyrics-of-rap-artist-it-tried-to-censor-on-instagram
15,instagram,Guardian,2022-11-22,Instagram told to reinstate music video removed at request of Met police,"Meta’s oversight board, the quasi-independent “supreme court” of Facebook and Instagram, has forced the company to reinstate a clip of drill music originally removed from Instagram at the request of the Metropolitan police. The clip, a short excerpt of the song Secrets Not Safe by Chinx (OS), was removed after the Met flagged the track to Meta, arguing that it could lead to “retaliatory violence” in the context of the London gang scene. The force told Meta it contained a “veiled threat”, referencing a shooting in 2017, and as a result the company manually removed 52 posts containing the track and automated systems removed it a further 112 times. Now, the oversight board says those removals were a mistake. The track does not break Facebook or Instagram’s rules, it argues, and basic principles of free speech, equality and transparency were breached in allowing a police operation to censor a musician in secret. “While law enforcement can sometimes provide context and expertise, not every piece of content that law enforcement would prefer to have taken down should be taken down,” the board said in its ruling. “It is therefore critical that Meta evaluates these requests independently, particularly when they relate to artistic expression from individuals in minority or marginalised groups for whom the risk of cultural bias against their content is acute.” As part of its investigation into the removal of the track, the oversight board filed multiple freedom of information requests with the Met police, finding that the force had filed 286 requests to take down or review posts about drill music in the 12 months from June 2021, and that 255 of those had resulted in the removal of content. Over the same period, it had not made a single request to remove any other music genre, the force said. “This intensive focus on one music genre among many that include reference to violence raises serious concerns of potential over-policing of certain communities,” the board argued. The board also asked the Met how it ensured that free speech rights were protected, and what its specific policies were about flagging content to social networks. The force said it was unable to answer, with decisions made on a case-by-case basis. Crucially, the Met did not allege any of the drill music that it had asked Meta to take down had broken UK law. Instead, its argument was that the music had broken Facebook and Instagram’s community standards, since it was “potentially threatening or likely to contribute to imminent violence or physical harm”. The police did not provide public evidence to back up that claim. Because the internal Meta team that works with the police comprises senior specialists, users whose content is taken down also have no ability to appeal. In a statement, Meta said: “We do not remove content simply because law enforcement requests it – we take action if content is found to violate our policies or local law. As part of our robust review process, we assess whether a request is consistent with internationally-recognised standards on human rights, including due process, privacy, free expression and the rule of law.” The oversight board recommended that, in the future, Meta should have a public and standardised system for content removal requests from law enforcement and other state actors, including asking for evidence to back up claims that a policy has been violated, and to review its decisions in aggregate to assess for systemic biases against communities or minorities. Although it is funded by Meta, and its co-chairs were selected by the social network, the oversight board operates largely independently, and has the power to overrule the moderation teams of Facebook and Instagram, and to force content to be reinstated to the site, as it has done in this case. It can also issue non-binding recommendations for the company’s future policies, which Meta reserves the right to refuse but has agreed to respond to even if it decides not to enact them.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/22/instagram-told-to-reinstate-music-video-removed-at-request-of-met-police

Rinehart, the executive chair of mining and agricultural company Hancock Prospecting, has publicly backed Trump since at least 2016, when he was elected president. In a speech to a mining conference in Mount Isa in November 2016, she said she had recently met with members of Trump’s campaign team including Rudy Giuliani and then-campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. • Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup She said Trump and his team had won the 2016 election despite “constant and unrelenting negative coverage”, because they “listened to the people of America” who wanted “less government tape, secondly less taxation, and for the USA to grow and be economically strong again”. Rinehart urged Australia to follow Trump’s lead on his plan to cut “federal government tape” by 50% in his first months of office, and to cut company tax to 15%. Rinehart, considered Australia’s richest person and one of the richest women in the world, also attended a 2019 state dinner hosted by Trump at the White House for former Australian prime minister Scott Morrison. She is also named as a member of the Trumpettes, an all-female Trump high society supporter group founded in the US in 2015, according to multiple social media posts from the network. She is referred to in one of their posts as the “lead Trumpette in Australia”. In 2018 the group dubbed Rinehart “Trumpette of the week”. The Trumpettes were founded by Hollywood reporter turned socialite Toni Holt Kramer. The group says on its site “your job as a Trumpette is to help get the real Donald J. Trump elected … introduce the real man to your family, your friends, the people you work with and anyone you come in contact with … and then be ready to explain why you think Donald Trump will be the best president for all of America”. Also seen in the photo posted by Eric Trump, standing just behind Rinehart, was Mike Lindell, the founder of MyPillow, an alleged conspiracy theorist who has also heavily backed Trump.

0,tiktok,news.com.au,2023-05-03,Comedian Stephanie Broadbridge on trolling after joke TikTok video viewed 47 million times,"COMMENT
It was a Sunday morning, I’m a stand-up comedian and I was booked for an unusual gig. I would be sitting opposite a male comedian as we read dad jokes from the internet to each other and tried not to laugh. If we did laugh, we had to take a shot of vodka. 
It was early in the morning and I’m allergic to alcohol so I was pretty motivated to win the challenge. 
I won 10-1. 
The challenge was filmed and turned into short clips for the relatively small Aussie TikTok account YeahMadTV. I was paid $200 and I assumed the video content would disappear into social media land like the billions of other comedy videos that no one ever sees. But that’s not what happened. 
The clips went viral. One clip currently has over 47 million views and counting. 
Best dog joke ever written. #dadjokes#dadjokesoftheday#dadjoke#jokes#fyp#dadjokesoftiktok
The joke? What do you call a dog that can do magic? A Labra-cadabrador.
Why was it so popular? Because people hated me and left vicious, sexist comments to let me know exactly how much. The more they commented, the more views the video received. 
When the clip was posted, the important information that I was a performer in a ‘try not to laugh challenge’ wasn’t included. Instead, it was captioned “Best dog joke ever written’ so when I didn’t laugh at the joke, I just looked mean.
The commentary seemed to be that how dare I, a woman, not laugh at the funny man’s joke (not his joke, a joke off the internet). I must be a Karen, a feminist, a cat lady, a [redacted] who doesn’t have a sense of humour. The few people in the comments who tried to stick up for me by explaining it was a challenge, were also attacked.
I contacted YeahMadTV and they removed some of the nastiest comments and put in the comments that it was the ‘try not to laugh’ challenge but it didn’t stop there. The video developed a life of its own. 
One anonymous account reposted the clip on 9gag, a social media platform that allows users to upload and share content from other social media sites. It was shared under the caption ‘She has no sense of Humour’. The thousands of comments on 9gag, that I can’t delete, are so disgusting that I couldn’t get through them.
Once I realised YeahMadTV had tagged me, I untagged myself immediately but the trolls still found me.
They wrote negative comments on every stand-up comedy clip I had on TikTok and Instagram. 
I was running ads for my live stand up shows at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and those ads all had to be removed because of the trolling. 
It is very hard to be funny when every time I tell a joke on stage, I can picture these vile comments screaming at me from the audience.
On the final night of my Melbourne Comedy Festival run I broke down. I left the stage ten minutes into my show and burst into tears. I have been performing comedy almost every single night for seven years and this has never happened to me before. I am professional and reliable. I don’t cancel. I built my reputation on being ‘the chick that doesn’t cancel’.
Yes, of course, men get negative comments online too, but this was different. The language was gendered. It was violent. It was threatening. The attacks were intended to silence me, intimidate me and humiliate me, because I had committed a mortal sin of womanhood, not laughing at a man’s crappy joke. I know I’m the least objective person in this situation but it’s hard to deny the lashings of misogyny. 
Sure, I could delete social media. If I stop putting myself out there, then people will stop trolling me. But I am a stand-up comedian. This is my job. Part of that job is promoting myself online and I deserve to feel safe at work. 
It’s not just the arts where a strong social media presence is a requirement. Social media is an integral part of most careers. Nearly every employer checks you out online before hiring you, so to say “just ignore it” is completely unreasonable.
That’s asking me to ignore the cheapest and most efficient way to promote myself. “Don’t worry about it” or “don’t post things if you don’t want to get attacked” does not resolve the issue. I am worried about it. It’s disgusting, it’s sexist and it’s ruining my career.
Given social media is an important part of our work life and women are trolled more than men how is that workplace equality? Why are we accepting trolling as a consequence of being online?
The number of women in comedy I have spoken to that have received similar treatment online is truly horrifying. Some have quit comedy, some have been seeking mental health treatment ever since, some just put up with it as part of the deal.
I don’t have a solution, but I would suggest that next time you are tempted to write a mean comment on a random clip for no other reason except that you’re bored, maybe don’t.

1,tiktok,news.com.au,2023-05-10,Major problem with electric vehicle exposed in TikTok,"An Australian driver has revealed a glaring problem with electric vehicles after finding himself stranded on the side of the road when one of his tyres went flat.
Eddy May was driving home in his electric Mercedes-Benz EQC-400 on Sunday just before midday when his rear left wheel deflated, leaving him and his wife stranded on the side of the road in Adelaide. 
Making use of an in-car customer service offered in the luxury model, he pressed a button and spent five minutes on the phone with Mercedes about the tyre.
“I’ve spoken to them, they’re sending a tow truck,” Mr May told his followers in a clip shared to TikTok. 
“Quick five minutes on the phone, a $200 cab charge voucher to get home, [and the] car’s going to get towed to Mercedes and the car’s going to be fixed tomorrow apparently,” he said. 
About 35 minutes later, the $128,000 vehicle was loaded onto a tow truck and the couple’s taxi arrived. 
By just after 12pm, they were on their way home. 
“Pretty good. Well done Mercedes,” Mr May said. 
But his video praising Mercedes for their service raised questions over why a spare tyre wasn’t kept inside the car as it would be for petrol cars. 
“There’s no spare in this f**king car because all the room is taken up with batteries and so forth,” Mr May said. 
Most electric vehicles don’t come with spare tyres given the extra space and weight they require. 
“I would be severely unimpressed with needing a tow truck, taxi ride, loan car and what 1-2 days without my car over a flat tyre,” one comment on the video read. 
“I would much prefer the 10 minutes to change the tyre,” another wrote. 
“Great service, interesting way of saving the planet and reducing carbon emissions. Taxi ride and tow truck compared with carrying a spare tyre,” a third said. 
Mr May argued the vehicle still worked out to be friendlier on the environment overall, even though it used a lot of resources when a tyre blew out. 
In response to someone who described the car a “joke”, he said it was still ahead in terms of emissions. 
“24,000 kms with no petrol or oil and 38 kms on a diesel truck. I still think it’s doing okay,” he said. ",https://www.news.com.au/technology/motoring/on-the-road/glaring-problem-exposed-in-tiktok-after-mans-tyre-goes-flat/news-story/fb3b97957a99ebe2a53d09ef4243423e
2,tiktok,news.com.au,2023-04-18,Benadryl Challenge: US teenager dies after trying TikTok trend,"A 13-year-old boy in the US has died after taking part in a viral TikTok challenge. 
The challenge involves swallowing up to 14 benadryl pills — an antihistamine allergy medication — to induce hallucinations, with participants then posting videos of their experience on social media. 
Believed to have been started in 2022, the trend has already caused a spate of hospitalisations among Australian teens attempting to participate.
Jacob Stevens from Ohio began to seize up after ingesting a lethal dose.
He was immediately rushed to the hospital as his body began to shut down. 
Tragically, after six days on life support, his family made the heart-wrenching decision to let him pass, as his brain functions had ceased.
Jacob’s father, Justin, is now dedicated to warning parents and teens of the dangers of social media and has shared a photo of Jacob hooked up to life support in the hospital to spread awareness.
“It was too much for his body,” the grieving father said via ABC 6, recalling the “worst day of his life”.
“No brain scan, there was nothing there. They said we could keep him on the vent, that he could lay there, but he will never open his eyes, he’ll never breathe, smile, walk or talk.”
“It didn’t matter how bad of a day I was having, no one could make me smile, Jacob could make me smile,” Justin recalled through tears.
Justin and his family have also begun pushing politicians to take steps to prevent other kids from partaking in such challenges by putting age restrictions on over-the-counter drugs like Benadryl. 
He has also suggested imposing an age restriction for creating accounts on TikTok, forcing users to provide identification before being allowed on the platform.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a statement warning of the dangers of participating in the “Benadryl Challenge” and is aware of reports of teenagers ending up in emergency rooms or dying after taking part.
“Taking higher than recommended doses of the common over-the-counter (OTC) allergy medicine diphenhydramine (Benadryl) can lead to serious heart problems, seizures, coma or even death,” the FDA wrote.
“We are aware of news reports of teenagers ending up in emergency rooms or dying after participating in the Benadryl Challenge encouraged in videos posted on the social media application TikTok.”
Queensland Ambulance Service confirmed an alarming number of call-outs in recent weeks after the trend became popular.
Seizures and head wounds were among the injuries sustained for those who took part, QAS said.
“There were four calls in one hour in South East Queensland and all of those children needed transport to hospital,” a spokeswoman said last year.
Among the harmful side effects from high doses are seizures and a racing heart rate.
Its damage has been so far reaching, the trend prompted drug manufacturer Johnson and Johnson to issue a warning in its popularity’s wake.
“We understand that consumers may have heard about an online ‘challenge’ involving the misuse or abuse of diphenhydramine,” the company said.
“This challenge, which involves the ingestion of excessive quantities of diphenhydramine, is a dangerous trend and should be stopped immediately.”",https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/social/us-teenager-dies-after-trying-tiktok-benadryl-challenge/news-story/2f4a992dd19a9c65150774d2b7623b2e
3,tiktok,news.com.au,2023-04-16,Chinese diplomat blasts Australian Government ban on TikTok,"A former Chinese diplomat has labelled Australia’s TikTok ban on government devices “racism”, telling the Government: “You do not want to have an enemy with 1.4 billion people.”
In an interview with 60 Minutes, former diplomat and CCP mouthpiece Victor Gao said of the ban: “Probably it’s racism, probably it’s racial discrimination, probably it’s banning Chinese again, which was a disaster many years ago.
“Now you want to do that again? It will not be a success.”
The Australian Government banned the Chinese-owned social media platform from all government devices, citing fears over security. It follows similar bans in many other countries around the world.
“This has been informed by security agencies’ advice on work that’s been done and provided to the government, so that’s the decision we’ve taken is around government-issued devices,” Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said earlier this month.
Concerns over the scope of personal information that TikTok harvests and its parent company ByteDance’s apparent links to the communist regime has led governments around the world to believe that China could be weaponising the social media app to spy on their citizens.
Cybersecurity expert Robert Potter previously told 60 Minutes that the app collects a lot more data than other social media sites.
“It can collect your keystroke patterns, body language, face and body features. It can access photos or passwords that are stored in your phone over time,” he said.
“There’s a super location field that allows them to collect which direction you’re facing, how fast you’re moving, how high off the ground you are, your latitude and longitude.”
However Mr Gao said Australia shouldn’t feel threatened by the app.
“Australians need to be really confident about their own system, rather than being threatened by TikTok. Banning it is not a sign of strength. It’s not a sign of superiority, it’s not a sign of confidence. It’s just the opposite,” he said.
He also said the ban could cause further tensions in Australia’s already strained relationship with China.
“I would urge the Australian Government to really treat China as an equal, because you do not want to have an enemy with 1.4 billion people,” he said.
Meanwhile, TikTok Australia and New Zealand general manager Lee Hunter insists the ban is politically motivated, saying there was “no evidence” to support that people’s data was at risk.
He also told 60 Minutes TikTok Australia will not hand over personal information to the CCP.
“We need to be careful about how we work with China, but at the end of the day TikTok is not China. We’re an entertainment platform. We’re about giving people interesting videos in their day,” he said.
All the countries that have total or partial bans on TikTok:
Australia isn’t alone in its ban of TikTok from government devices. Many countries around the world have taken similar measures.
Australia: TikTok banned from all federal government-owned devices.
New Zealand: On March 17, New Zealand announced TikTok would be banned from the phones of government politicians at the end of the month. But it only applies to about 500 people in the parliamentary complex.
Estonia: At the end of March, Estonia’s outgoing minister of IT and foreign trade, Kristjan Järvan, said TikTok would be banned from smartphones issued by the state to public officials.
UK: On March 16, an immediate ban was announced of the app on government official devices.
EU governing bodies: The European Parliament, European Commission, and the EU Council have all banned TikTok on staff devices, citing cybersecurity concerns.
France: On March 24, the French government banned the installation and use of “recreational” applications such as TikTok, Netflix and Instagram on the work phones of 2.5 million civil servants.
Netherlands: The government discourages the use of all apps from “countries with an aggressive cyber-program” on phones distributed by the government. TikTok wasn’t mentioned by name.
Norway: On March 23, the Norwegian parliament banned TikTok from devices issued to government employees.
Belgium: On March 10, Belgium announced it was banning TikTok from devices owned or paid for by Belgium’s federal government for at least six months.
Denmark: On March 6, Denmark’s Defence Ministry announced it would “ban the use of the app on official units” as a cybersecurity measure.
USA: Government agencies were given until the end of March to delete TikTok from federal devices and systems. However some US politicians have been advocating an outright ban. However, a bid to ban TikTok from operating in the United States altogether was blocked in the senate on March 30. Now, though, Montana has passed a bill to ban TikTok outright from the state. If signed into law, it could come into effect from January 2024.
Canada: The country announced on February 28 it was banning TikTok from all government-issued devices.
India: In 2020, India imposed a ban on TikTok and some other Chinese apps, shortly after a clash between Indian and Chinese troops at a disputed Himalayan border.
Taiwan: In December 2022, Taiwan imposed a TikTok ban on all government devices.
Pakistan: Pakistani authorities have temporarily banned TikTok at least four times since October 2020, citing concerns that the app promotes immoral content.
Afghanistan: Taliban leaders banned TikTok in 2022 on the grounds of protecting youths from “being misled”.",https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/social/chinese-diplomat-calls-australia-racist-after-government-tiktok-ban/news-story/879788d1f90f8dcd867829753de1ce4c
4,tiktok,news.com.au,2023-04-18,15-minute cities: Woman’s bizarre claim about Victorian road project,"A 15-minute city conspiracy theorist has made a bold claim about the construction of multiple U-turn bays on a Victorian road, as debate over the urban-planning concept continues globally. 
In a video shared to Twitter, an Australian podcaster filmed herself driving along Narre Warren North Road which is situated 38km southeast of Melbourne and is currently undergoing upgrades.
The roadworks commenced in 2020 and are part of the state government’s Big Build project which entailed the addition of extra lanes, installation of traffic lights and road safety improvements. 
Final asphalting works, guardrail and signage installations, line markings and vegetation works are currently underway with the project expected to be completed by mid this year.
In line with the project, extra U-turn bays were created for safer and easier access to streets adjacent to the main road. 
However, the conspiracy theorist believes these turnaround lanes have been installed to serve a more dire purpose, believing more 15-minute or 20-minute cities are set to pop up in the future. 
Also known as smart cities, the notion is an urban development idea where everything you need access to is located within a short distance.
This may include schools, shops, GP clinics and even the office or your place of work, all within the same zone. 
The concept is the brainchild of Franco-Colombian urbanist Carlos Moreno who came up with the idea to prompt more sustainable, convenient and healthier living.
Key elements of the theory include keeping essential services close, creating a sense of community solidarity and inspiring green urban living.
However, not all are convinced, with some conspiracists comparing the theory to a Stalin-style plot to keep people in lockdown or under the government’s control.
In the case of the woman who filmed herself driving along Narre Warren North Road, she believes the road upgrade project will become a “Checkpoint Charlie” for smart cities.
“This used to be a country road. Not only are they building wires and towers but they’re also putting in interestingly three or four U-turn opportunities,” she explained in the video.
“I guess that’s because you’ll get a warning – you’re about to leave your 20-minute city, your district, your zone (and it’s your) last chance to turn back obviously before the fines start.”
As she drives further down the road, the woman highlights three “pillars with weird blue lights” positioned in the middle of the road next to several parked tradie cars. 
“Up here to the right you’ll see three bollards … I think this right here is the checkpoint,” she claims in the video. 
“There’s now all of these opportunities to pull a U-turn and go back the way you came.
“In the future, going out to the countryside is not something they’re going to allow you to do without you handing over your money.”
The tweet, which has received over 1.3 million views and 692 likes, has amassed debate over the urban planning concept online with many arguing the woman has taken her thoughts “too far”.
“This is ridiculous. U-turns, or access for emergency vehicles? Or both? Forget something and need to go back home? A U-turn is handy. This is not a nefarious thing,” one person tweeted.
“15 minute (cities) have been around for ages and have nothing to do with climate change lockdowns. It’s literally about ease of access and reducing dependency on cars,” a second person said.
“No one is preventing you from going further away in your car.”
A third comment read: “The wires reduce accidents. The breaks in the wire provide access points for emergency vehicles to turn. 
“These safety measures can be found on roads around Australia.”
Meanwhile, one man suggested the push for electric vehicles (EV) over petrol cars could be another excuse to restrict people to their “zone”.
“I’m thinking this is one of the major reasons they want EV versus gas vehicles, fewer and less range!” he said. 
The debate online follows huge rallies around the world as conspiracy theorists criticise the concept, which has already come into effect in 16 cities globally including Paris and Shanghai. 
Edmonton Canada was also another city which tried to implement the idea, however received backlash from its residents.
“You will spend 90 per cent of your life in this 15-minute area as they are monitoring your carbon footprint,” a flyer circulating warned.
Meanwhile, those who agree with the theory have slammed its critics, including registered nurse Christopher Patterson and national radio broadcaster Triple J Hack. 
“There are a lot of noted intellectuals on TikTok telling me I should be suspicious of convenience,” Triple J Hack reporter Shalailah Medhora said in a radio package last month. 
Dr Patterson, who is also a University of Wollongong lecturer, explained there are numerous health benefits to the theory that many sceptics are overlooking.
“The main (benefit) is giving people back their freedom (and) time,” Dr Patterson said.
“The time you get back you could put into (your) health or sitting in green spaces to connect back with your community and family.”",https://www.news.com.au/technology/motoring/on-the-road/checkpoint-charlie-woman-makes-wild-smart-city-claim-about-victorian-road/news-story/d5a6df870d6b7b29f73330371624b62c

Avid gym-goer and TikTok user Beba showed that she wasn’t going to let anyone tell her what to wear while working out and shared her response in a video, The Sun reported.
The influencer showed her reaction “when the lady at the gym thinks my top is too revealing.”
“I hate when b***hes be like ‘humble yourself.’ B***h, I’m not humbling to make you feel good about yourself,” Beba said.
S
he continued: “Up your game, b***h. You feel insecure around me, you feel like less than? That’s your problem.
“That sounds like your own personal issues you need to talk about with your therapist, b***h,” the content creator said.
Beba can be seen wearing a black bandeau bra and black sweatpants in the clip.
The content creator showed off her impressive physique in the stylish outfit.
Her toned midriff and sculpted abs were clearly visible as she clapped back at her hater.
TikTok users took to the comments section to share their thoughts on the situation.
“I‘d be like ’sounds like a personal problem to me, girrrrl,’” wrote one viewer.
Another follower said: “Me yesterday in my Fenty sports bra with the girlies sitting pretty.”
“And that’s on PERIODT,” commented a third person who related to body shaming.

6,tiktok,news.com.au,2023-04-30,I’m a dentist — you’re ruining your teeth with these four common mistakes,"A dentist has revealed the four mistakes people make that wreak havoc on their smiles — and they have nothing to do with nightmarish TikTok challenges.
Dr. Gerry Curatola, who founded New York-based Rejuvenation Dentistry, is advising against some commonplace dental practices — such as brushing with charcoal toothpaste and undergoing root canals.
He’s even condemned a common product sold at supermarkets.
Mouthwash
Put down the Listerine, the enamel expert argues.
“Mouthwash has absolutely no value in oral care,” he cautioned to the Daily Mail in an interview published Saturday. “It’s another man-made creation by the consumer products industry.”
Despite guidance that certain mouthwashes can keep bacteria, plaque, tooth decay and gingivitis at bay, Curatola insists they could cause harm.
He claims some mouthwashes contain preservatives, such as parabens, that can destroy the mouth’s microbiome.
“I’m always amazed that dentists are giving people little bottles of mouthwash on their cleaning visit that’s loaded with alcohol, artificial dyes and colours like that fluorescent blue colour, made from coal tar, which is a known carcinogen,” Curatola said.
According to Healthline, mouthwashes can be harmful if overused.
Experts warn against frequent mouthwash usage due to potential teeth staining from dyes, removal of the healthy microbiome and a potential cancer risk, for which there is limited evidence.
Root canals
Over 41,000 root canals are performed every day in America — but Curatola refuses to be part of that trend.
“It’s the only procedure we do where we keep human dead tissue inside you,” he explained.
The treatment involves removing bacteria and decay from the tooth, disinfecting the area, filling the roots, and sealing them to prevent further decay.
Not only are they painful and, like any procedure, carry risks, but they have also been linked to increased endotoxin levels. However, there is limited research on the phenomenon.
“These are bacteria and bacterial by-products that can dysregulate your immune system. So they’re really not healthy for the patient long term,” Curatola said.
Healthline dispelled the purported connection between cancer and root canals, arguing the “myth” causes unnecessary fear in those who would benefit from the procedure.
Root canal risks include persistent infections, improper seals and inadequate filling, but the greatest risk could be an untreated canal.
Charcoal toothpaste
Activated charcoal has surged in popularity with promises of whitening teeth and providing fresh breath.
But Curatola warns it can be abrasive and even ruin tooth enamel.
“It’s the equivalent of using Ajax on your teeth,” he explained. “If you’re brushing with it every day, you’re going to wave your enamel away, and your teeth are going to get more sensitive.”
Despite being sold by Colgate and other major dental brands, limited research has suggested that charcoal toothpaste may be too abrasive for everyday use and often does not contain fluoride, the mineral that facilitates a healthy smile.
Metal fillings
While not as widespread anymore, metal fillings were once commonplace in dentistry.
The fillings, also called dental amalgam, are often a mixture of liquid mercury and powdered alloy.
The mercury content in the fillings has the potential to release mercury vapour into the mouth, which could be inhaled by the lungs.
Mercury exposure has been linked to numerous adverse health affects, prompting a 2020 warning against the use of metal fillings in high-risk individuals.
Curatola recommends other options, such as ceramic, porcelain or resin fillings.

7,tiktok,news.com.au,2023-05-01,Australian Government announces crackdown on illegal black market vapes,"Australia is set to ban the importation of most vapes, introduce plain packaging and strip them from convenience store shelves under world-first reforms.
The biggest crackdown on e-cigarettes in Australian history is set to be unveiled in the May budget amid fears vaping has emerged as a serious behavioural crisis in schools across the nation.
Under current laws vapes with nicotine can only be bought with a prescription from a chemist. 
But that hasn’t stopped thousands of convenience stores and online providers selling to kids.
Health Minister Mark Butler will unveil the changes on Tuesday under a crackdown that will also involve the states and territories moving to stamp out the growing black market in illegal vaping.
The changes will include tough new laws to:
- Stop the import of non-prescription vapes
- Increase the minimum quality standards for vapes including by restricting flavours, colours, and other ingredients;
- Require pharmaceutical-like packaging;
- Reduce the allowed nicotine concentrations and volumes; and
- Ban all single use, disposable vapes.
But the reforms won’t stop there, with the Albanese Government preparing to work with states and territories to close down the sale of vapes in retail settings, ending vape sales in convenience stores and other retail settings.
Health experts fear the rise of vapes poses a public health crisis with children who vape three times as likely to take up smoking.
Experts claim thousands of children can no longer sit still in class because they are addicted to vaping after smoking “bubblegum” flavours that secretly contain nicotine.
Health Minister Mark Butler said it was clear that governments had to act.
“Vaping was sold to governments and communities around the world as a therapeutic product to help long-term smokers quit,‘’ he said.
“It was not sold as a recreational product - especially not one for our kids. But that is what it has become: the biggest loophole in Australian history.
“One in six teenagers aged 14-17 has vaped. One in four people aged 18-24 has vaped. By contrast, only one in 70 people my age has vaped.
“And when more than a thousand teenagers aged 15 to 17 were asked where they could get vapes, four out of five of them said they found it easy or somewhat easy to buy them in retail stores.
“This is a product targeted at our kids, sold alongside lollies and chocolate bars.”
Mr Butler said schools were now struggling to deal with the fallout.
“Vaping has become the number one behavioural issue in high schools. And it’s becoming widespread in primary schools,” he said.
“Over the past 12 months, Victoria’s poisons hotline has taken 50 calls about children under 4 becoming sick from ingesting or using a vape.
“Under the age of 4! Vapes contain 200 toxic chemicals that do not belong in the lungs, the same chemicals you’ll find in nail polish remover and weed killer.
“Just like they did with smoking, Big Tobacco has taken another addictive product, wrapped it in shiny packaging and added flavours to create a new generation of nicotine addicts.
 “Vapers are three times as likely to take up smoking, which explains why under 25s are the only cohort in the community currently recording an increase in smoking rates.
“This must end.”
Vape police could be rolled out to monitor the sale of e-cigarettes to children across Australia including on TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram under a plan that will ban most imports and introduce plain packaging.
VicHealth CEO Sandro Demaio, a globally-renowned public health expert and medical doctor, told news.com.au that as soon as the Albanese Government introduced new import bans enforcement could be much tougher at a state level.
“In many ways this explosion of vaping has really come out of nowhere over just a couple of years,’’ he said.
“But the reverse is also possible if we ban the advertising of vapes and actually clamp down on the use of social media to promote these products.
“If we make them less alluring, so they don’t they don’t come in Froot Loops flavour and look like a highlighter. They don’t have unicorns on the side. That will make them far less appealing.
“And basically cut off the tap at the border. Those things will absolutely make a huge difference.”
Dr Demaio said that introducing plain packaging was important because that would then allow enforcement to swing into action.
“Obviously, we want to close the access and the huge amount of vapes that have been finding their way into the hands of particularly young people,’’ he said.
“So what needs to happen at the state level is that there needs to be a licensing scheme in every state.
“The licences themselves would create revenue, which can support enforcement officers, so we’re not relying on police to enforce the measures that we currently have.
“In theory, they’re not currently subject to the laws because they don’t contain nicotine. But the vast majority do contain nicotine; they’re just simply not putting in all the packets.
“And really, what needs to be done is to say, ‘Well, if there’s no flavours, no colours and the only pathway through a prescription, and they, they, they have pharmaceutical packaging, it then makes it much easier for the states to actually enforce it.”
He warned children were being “viciously” exploited.
“Well, what’s happened over the last few years is that the tobacco industry and the e-cigarette industry, of which there’s huge overlap, has seen an opportunity to, you know, get another entire generation of Australians addicted to nicotine with a new product. That’s flown under the radar,’’ he said.
“This industry has used young people’s social media. These things are all over social media. You can jump on Tik Tok and there are ads for E cigarettes with a ‘Buy Now’ button.
“Social media is under-regulated in this country. They have flooded the market with really cheap imports from overseas that don’t declare that they contain nicotine.
“And it’s been a combination of social media, weaponising their data on social media and flooding the market with really cheap and highly addictive imports.”",https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/australian-government-announces-crackdown-on-illegal-black-market-vapes/news-story/9771ff97a465a95b49945da68b61fb00
0,tiktok,Guardian,2023-05-12,The Guardian view on the Taylor Swift book rumour: a TikTok reckoning | Editorial,"Has there ever been such a flutter in the pop culture dovecote as the one provoked by the “leak” that an unknown book, due to be published in July, was by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift? A million copies were reportedly poised to roll off the presses of the mystery title, which was identified only as “4C Untitled Flatiron Nonfiction Summer 2023”. It had soared to the top of the US book charts. The date for revealing the author and title had been set for next month, ahead of publication in July, but after a week of feverish discussion, and the presale of many thousands of books at a full price of $45 (£36) a copy, the publisher was forced to show its hand early. The title is an oral history of – and by – the K-pop boyband BTS. As the first Asian group to break through to the top of the western music industry, and worth an estimated $3.6bn annually to South Korea’s economy, BTS have their own mammoth fanbase, just not the same one. Their fans, known as Army, are famously devoted and ferociously energetic and organised. They may also be all the hungrier for new content, given that BTS are on a “temporary break”, with some members already beginning their compulsory military service. The title remains at the top of Amazon’s US bookchart. The music business has never been short on hype. But this saga was driven primarily by consumers rather than publicists. The most interesting thing about it is what it says about the power of TikTok and the precipitous spread of misinformation among those who really want to believe. In this respect, the episode could be seen as an analogue of any number of far-fetched conspiracy theories. Given that Swift is just 33 years old, and in middle of both a punishing multi-arena tour and a project to re-record her first six albums, it always seemed unlikely that she could have made time for a memoir. Numerology played a part in the spread of the rumour, with fans speculating that the digits in the pagination – 544 – added up to Swift’s favourite number, 13. The fact that some editions of Jane Austen’s Emma, Charles Dickens’s Great Expectations and Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women have the same pagination wouldn’t have deterred them. In a teasing tweet last week, Swift made an inside joke about the number nine (the publication date of the mystery book, but also a date mentioned in one of her lyrics). What is beyond doubt is the astonishing popularity of both acts. Swift has just become the first living artist with 10 albums simultaneously in the Top 100 of the US charts and the first living female artist with at least three albums in the Top 10 at the same time. BTS have repeatedly smashed records and notched up six US No 1s, with all their albums topping the US charts. The two acts have battled it out for supremacy globally. This level of acclaim sets musicians up for the algorithmic manipulation that makes more sinister conspiracy theories fly. That viral runaways are a pact with the devil is not in question. It is like a gold rush, except with prospectors who do not regard themselves as speculators but as buyers in good faith. The mystery memoir is a cautionary tale for our time – though in this case, some booksellers have promised refunds to disappointed Swifties. Not everyone is so scrupulous. Buyer beware.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/12/the-guardian-view-on-the-taylor-swift-book-rumour-a-tiktok-reckoning
1,tiktok,Guardian,2023-05-09,Josh Hawley book ridicules TikTok misogynist Andrew Tate – but is silent on Trump,"In his new book, the Missouri Republican senator Josh Hawley derides Andrew Tate, a social media influencer and self-proclaimed “king of toxic masculinity”, for “sleeping with as many women as possible, berating them, abusing them and celebrating it all as manly, as ‘freedom’”. Criticising Tate for “fake bravado” and “endless boasting”, Hawley adds: “Every man who has been in a locker room recognises the type … those aren’t the words of a man; those are the words of a child pretending to be a man.” The senator’s evocation of “a locker room” could be an allusion to Donald Trump, who as Republican candidate for president in 2016 memorably dismissed as “locker room talk” the Access Hollywood tape, hot-mic audio in which he described kissing and grabbing women – even by the genitals – without their consent. But it isn’t. Hawley does not mention Trump even once in his new book, Manhood: The Masculine Virtues America Needs. The book will be published in the US next week. The Guardian obtained a copy. The Guardian contacted Hawley for comment, asking if his criticism of Tate could and should be applied to Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination. No reply was forthcoming. Tate was arrested in Romania in December, on charges of organised crime, rape and human trafficking. Hawley has been viewed as a possible contender for the Republican nomination in 2024 but has said he will not run. He has also dismissed rumours that Trump, who enjoys clear leads in polling despite deepening legal jeopardy on a number of fronts, would pick him as his running mate. “Nobody wants to be vice-president,” Hawley said. But Hawley has also said, in what the Washington Post said was close to an endorsement: “Trump is going to be the nominee, I think it’s inevitable. After what Alvin Bragg did, I think that Donald Trump is absolutely going to be the nominee, and yeah, I’ll support him.” Alvin Bragg is the Manhattan district attorney who last month charged Trump with 34 felony counts related to his hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, a porn star, regarding her claims of a sexual affair. Trump denies the affair but spent $130,000 to quieten Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. In his new book, in which Trump is conspicuous by his absence, Hawley dwells at length on pornography and its deleterious influence over modern American men. Trump has been married three times, has frequently bragged about his sexual conquests and has seen his infidelity widely documented by tabloid media. In 2019, Barry Levine and Monique el-Faizy published a book on the subject, All the President’s Women. More than 20 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct or assault. He denies all wrongdoing but one civil case is now at trial in New York. E Jean Carroll, a former magazine columnist, alleges that Trump raped her in a New York department store changing room in the mid-1990s. In video of Trump’s deposition released to the public last week, Trump was asked about the Access Hollywood tape and his claim to be able to grab women “by the pussy” because, as a star, he could “do anything”. Trump said: “Well historically, that’s true with stars.” He was asked: “It’s true you can grab them by the pussy?” He said: “Well, if you look over the last million years, I guess that’s been largely true. Not always, but largely true. Unfortunately or fortunately.” “You consider yourself a star?” “I think you can say that, yeah.” Trump was also asked if he had seen other women while married to his first wife, Ivana Trump. He answered: “I don’t know.” Trump’s affair with Marla Maples, who eventually became his second wife and to whom he was married at the time of the alleged attack on Carroll, was a tabloid staple in the 1980s. One famous New York tabloid headline, engineered by Trump, saw Maples proclaim him the provider of the “Best Sex I’ve Ever Had”. In his new book about Manhood, writing about Andrew Tate, Hawley condemns an “idea of success [that] apparently involved sleeping with as many women as possible, berating them, abusing them and celebrating it all as manly, as ‘freedom’”. The senator, who has said he will support Trump for president, adds: “Every man who has been in a locker room recognises the type. The fake bravado, the endless boasting. “Those aren’t the words of a man; those are the words of a child pretending to be a man he thinks someone will like or respect.”",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/09/josh-hawley-book-andrew-tate-trump-locker-room-talk
2,tiktok,Guardian,2023-05-05, Staffordshire dog statues back in vogue with TikTok generation,"Pairs of Staffordshire ceramic dogs, once commonplace on Victorian mantelpieces, are having a sudden resurgence with a boom in demand from a new generation. The vintage marketplace Vinterior reports that searches for Staffordshire dog statues is up 115% year-on-year. When Vinterior launched a recent pop-up store in London’s Selfridges, it was the dogs not the Danish dining chairs that were the first items to sell out. The antiques specialist, John Howard, is somewhat surprised but thrilled to see the Victoriana look back in vogue. “The market changed significantly around 10 years ago with the end of the Laura Ashley era. But now we are seeing demand for more kitsch pieces again. It’s a bit of a cool in-joke to have a pair,” he said. The original inspiration for the ceramic animals is said to have been Queen Victoria’s beloved Kings Charles spaniel Dash. Howard says the best quality Staffordshire dog statues were made by small potteries in Staffordshire from 1845 to 1870. Fashioned from press-moulded earthenware, they were hand-painted and many were given glass eyes. From the 1900s onwards they were mass-produced and the quality dropped. However, they are not necessarily “fake”: many were made using original moulds, but the detailing is more blurred. Lucy Ward, Vinterior’s brand director, said there were two distinct groups buying the dogs – collectors with a long-term passion and the younger Instagram and TikTok generation. She explains the latter love the dogs’ playful and whimsical appearance and want to inject a touch of humour to their homes. The architect and interior designer Ben Pentreath falls into the former camp. He bought his first pair more than 15 years ago from a junk shop in Dorchester. They sit proudly on his mantelpiece at home in Dorset, while eight other pairs and six singles are peppered around the house. Until recently, the standard hallmarks of a millennial home have veered towards the minimal. Think grey walls, a potted fiddle-leaf fig and the ultimate influencer signifier – a bum/boob-shaped vase. The Wall Street Journal described it as “a colourless existence”. But maybe now Scandi is out, chintz is in. Describing the four-legged knick-knack’s comeback as “cyclical”, Pentreath said: “Everyone went mad for them in the late 60s and early 70s, when the whole world went into full on Victoriana-mode. That all went into the bin in the 80s and 90s along with Morris &amp; Co fabrics and seagrass carpets. Just for now, all that is back in taste.’ He compares it to the 1970s when “everyone freaked out about imminent global collapse. Nothing is more reassuring than a pair of dogs smiling at you happily from your mantlepiece as if to say it will all be OK in the end.” This naff-to-nostalgic trend is having a knock-on effect on prices. Howard says that before, a standard pair dating from the 1880s could easily be picked up for £120. Listings online now average about £400. Pentreath said he had also come across more fakes with “no air holes in the base, and not quite authentic weathering, chips and dings”. When it comes to choosing between different genuine versions, Howard said, “the better ones have certain features that distinguish them from the mundane”. He suggested searching for “a front leg that is separately moulded, a curly tail and a defined nose with some George Michael-esque stubble”. One of his customers, a former rock star, has more than 300 pairs but only buys pairs with pink noses. “I always say look at the face. It’s like looking at a bloke. Pick one you like. You’re going to be staring at it for a long time.”",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/05/staffordshire-dog-statues-back-in-vogue-with-tiktok-generation
3,tiktok,Guardian,2023-04-24,TikTok influencer Mahek Bukhari in court over alleged murder plot,"Two men died in a fireball when their car was driven off the road in a murder plot devised to silence one of the victims from revealing his affair with a married woman, a court has heard. Saqib Hussain, 21, and childhood friend Mohammed Hashim Ijazuddin, 21, were killed on 11 February 2022 when their car hit a tree as they were being pursued by two vehicles at speeds approaching 100mph. One of the vehicles contained Ansreen Bukhari, 45, who had had an on-off affair with Hussain for about three years and recently decided to call it off, jurors were told. WhatsApp messages show her daughter, 23-year-old TikTok influencer Mahek Bukhari, known as Maya, told her mother: “I’ll get him jumped by guys, and he won’t know what day it is.” Prosecutor Collingwood Thompson KC said Hussain “could not accept” the elder Bukhari’s decision and had started to blackmail her, threatening to tell her husband and sons about their relationship, and publish sexually explicit videos and photographs. The mother and daughter, from Stoke-on-Trent, are on trial with six other defendants accused of luring Hussain and his friend to a Tesco car park on the outskirts of Leicester before pursuing them at speed and ramming their car off the road. The couple are charged with murder alongside Natasha Akhtar, 22, Raees Jamal, 22, Rekan Karwan, 28, Mohammed Patel, 20, Sanaf Gulammustafa, 22, and Ammeer Jamal, 27. All eight defendants deny two counts of murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter. At the prosecution opening at Leicester crown court on Monday, jurors were played the 999 call Hussain made shortly before his crash, where he could be heard saying: “I’m being followed by two vehicles. They’re trying to block me in. “They’ve got balaclavas on. They’re trying to ram me off the road. They’re trying to kill me. I’m going to die.” Their vehicle split in two and was consumed in a fireball when it hit a tree on the A46 outside Leicester, and it was this 999 call which alerted police to the fact it was “not a tragic accident,” Thompson said. “Their investigation revealed a story of love, obsession, extortion and ultimately cold-blooded murder,” he added. Thompson said Hussain, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, had told a number of friends about his relationship with Bukhari and said that he loved her, although the pair would often get into arguments and stop communicating for periods of time. When she ended the relationship in January 2022, Hussain became “increasingly obsessive, professing his love for her and begging her to continue the relationship,” Thompson said. The court heard how he began blackmailing her with sexually explicit photos and videos, and demanding back the £3,000 he claimed he had spent on her over the course of the relationship, but Bukhari was reluctant to call the police fearing it would lead to her husband finding out about the affair. “Had she done that we would not be in this court trying allegations of murder,” Thompson said. Instead she confided in her daughter, Marek, who at the time had about 230,000 followers on TikTok. The prosecution claimed she was essential in recruiting Karwan and the other defendants who caused the crash. Thompson said they “set a trap” for Hussain where they planned to seize his phone containing the incriminating photos and videos. “But even doing that he could send a message to Ansreen Bukhari’s husband, which would ruin Ansreen’s marriage and damage her reputation. Further, Mahek Bukhari was an influencer on social media and the revelation of that affair might even have caused damage to her standing,” Thompson told the court. The trial continues.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/24/tiktok-influencer-mahek-bukhari-court-alleged-murder-plot
4,tiktok,Guardian,2023-04-23,TikTok cashing in on sale of counterfeit cosmetics and prescription skin creams,"TikTok is profiting from the sale of illegal and potentially dangerous beauty products, including counterfeit cosmetics and prescription-only skin creams, despite claiming to take a “zero tolerance” approach to rogue sellers. Counterfeit versions of Dior perfumes, Vaseline lip balms and Maybelline mascaras are among products being touted by third-party vendors via TikTok’s in-app marketplace. Skin-whitening lotions containing banned ingredients and potent acne creams that should only be supplied with a prescription were also being openly advertised last week. The products are being sold via TikTok Shop, an in-app shopping feature which allows users to buy products they see promoted by influencers and brands. There is also a “shop” tab where users can browse products, from cosmetics and clothing to toilet rolls and sports drinks. Since launching in 2021, the feature has helped turn TikTok into a destination for online retail, with a recent poll by market research firm Savanta finding that UK respondents under 26 used it to make 19 purchases per year – more than through Instagram or Facebook. TikTok, which takes 5% commission on sales, says it has strict rules on what can be sold via TikTok Shop, including prohibiting “the advertising and sale” of all counterfeit products. It also bans the sale of prescription-only medicines, such as the acne skin cream, and of skin-whitening creams that contain banned ingredients. “By ensuring the safety and authenticity of products sold on our platform, we create a positive shopping experience that users can have confidence in,” the policy adds. But analysis suggests the rules are not being effectively enforced, with illicit beauty products routinely being promoted to users via their content feeds and search results. Last week, nine out of the first 12 results shown to people searching “perfume” in the TikTok Shop section of the app appeared to be counterfeit. The products included variations of Dior’s Sauvage perfume, with names such as “Suave” and “Savage”, and a copy of Viktor and Rolf’s Flowerbomb perfume, which looks the same at first glance but was actually called “Mark and Victor”. Searches for mascara and other makeup items also led to recommendations for products that appeared to be fake. In some cases, the items remained live on the marketplace even when they were explicitly labelled as “dupes”. The prevalence of counterfeits has led to warnings from some TikTok Shop customers. A UK-based woman who bought a £25 beauty gift bag said she was “fuming” after being sent a single lip gloss that was clearly a counterfeit. “Be careful who you order from on TikTok Shop,” she said in a video. “Please check your sellers because there’s so many fakes going around. It’s not worth the loss of money. I can’t even get hold of the company and funnily enough they’ve now got nothing on their shop.” Another TikTok Shop customer said she was sent a poor-quality perfume that “literally smells like nail varnish” after ordering from what she thought was a reputable seller on TikTok. She messaged the seller to ask for a refund but was told that because the item had been opened it couldn’t be returned. In a video for followers she added: “If you are going to buy this perfume please check out the shops you’re buying it from and avoid these guys. I lost out on my money.” Health and consumer experts say the products are unlikely to have undergone safety testing in line with UK standards and contain unknown, potentially toxic ingredients. Many of the illicit products sold via TikTok Shop are made in China and shipped to the UK, according to TikTok’s listings data, with details about their origin and manufacturing processes unknown. Tests of seized counterfeit cosmetics by the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit have previously found that many contain “toxic levels” of arsenic, mercury and lead. If something goes wrong, customers are left exposed, Gavin Terry, lead officer for intellectual property at the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said. “If somebody has a counterfeit product and they put it on their skin and have an allergic reaction, they’ll go to the brand. And that’s one way these horror stories develop. The brand will say, ‘That’s not my product’. There’s no quality control and no guarantee they’re safe.” Terry added that there had been an increase in the sale of counterfeits on social media in recent years, with endorsements from influencers driving demand. “The influencers are the soft face of it. Behind that there’s a criminal organisation. And the social media platform is an intermediary – they create the conduit,” he said. In 2021, a report for the Intellectual Property Office found that the role of influencers was key to affecting consumer purchases of counterfeit products. Of 1,000 women aged 16 to 60 who were surveyed, 13% said they had been prompted by social media endorsements to buy counterfeit products. In addition to the fake products, prescription-only gels containing tretinoin, which is used for the treatment of acne, were available to buy through TikTok Shop last week. Tretinoin can lead to interactions with other medications and cause foetal abnormalities if taken while pregnant so must be used with medical supervision. Dr Jane Ravenscroft, of the British Association of Dermatologists, said the illicit sale of skin creams was a “major concern” and a “public health risk”. “Unfortunately, people selling these prescription products illegally are preying on people’s insecurities and naivety. Social media adds fuel to the fire,” she said. TikTok blocked searches for “tretinoin” and removed listings from third-party vendors that referred to the ingredient after being alerted by the Observer. Selling prescription-only drugs without a prescription is a criminal offence. Listings for skin-whitening creams containing the banned ingredient hydroquinone were also removed. TikTok said it took intellectual property infringement and the illicit sale of medical products seriously, and that those breaking the rules could be banned from the platform. It said it had removed hundreds of products and merchants from TikTok Shop so far this year, including around 50 listings flagged by the Observer. In 2022, it launched an Intellectual Property Protection Centre, a tool it said would help brands identify product listings that breach their IP.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/23/tiktok-cashing-in-counterfeit-beauty-products-skin-gels
5,tiktok,Guardian,2023-04-20,"TikTok data collection could reveal what floor a user is on, cybersecurity firm says","The Australian-US cybersecurity company that last year revealed the extent of TikTok’s data collection says the social media company has increased what location information it collects to include altitude, which could tell it what floor of a building a user is on. Last year Internet 2.0 released a study on the data TikTok attempts to collect on user devices, which includes contact lists and calendars, and its scanning of hard drives and geolocating devices on an hourly basis. At the time TikTok described the report as “baseless” and said it was no different to the data other social media apps seek. After the report a number of western countries, including Australia, banned the app from government-issued devices amid fears about whether the Chinese government could access data under national security law. The director of Internet 2.0, David Robinson, on Thursday told a Senate committee hearing on foreign influence on social media that TikTok had never directly addressed the issues his firm had raised in the report. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “[TikTok] have never come back to us and argued the points about the data and their source code,” he said. “So it’s their word against the source code. “They’ve called us names. They said we don’t understand what the code is. But they’ve never come back and qualified or quantify their position.” He said the company had undertaken another analysis of the updated source code and discovered that in addition to latitude and longitude data from a user’s device, the app was now seeking altitude information. “So if you’re in a high-rise building, they can tell what floor you’re on now,” Robinson said. “And that wasn’t previously in their code last year.” A spokesperson for TikTok rejected the claim, saying GPS data was not collected in Australia, and only collected overseas where users enabled it. “We do not collect GPS location data from users in Australia, nor do we seek permission for this,” they said. “To clarify, in other regions where a user has enabled and grants access to location services, TikTok collects this information based on device GPS data.” The spokesperson said Internet 2.0 admits their analysis is “not conclusive and doesn’t include a detailed source code review, which they admit is the best way to assess data collection practices”. “What’s been presented are misleading, inconsistent results based on a flawed and biased analysis that lacked any real depth.” Robinson said with other apps where Internet 2.0 had analysed the source code – such as with Telegram and Proton – the companies explained their code or provided more evidence as to what the code does. He said TikTok had never approached it that way. “No one’s perfect,” he said. “But to be honest about it, and go, ‘Yes, we’ve had an issue. We didn’t know about it, we’re checking it, we’re fixing it’ – that’s normal behaviour, that’s trustworthy behaviour, in our opinion. “But to call us names and basically never, never, never show your code and explain it makes me not trust them.” The hearing continues on Friday.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/21/tiktok-data-collection-could-reveal-what-floor-a-user-is-on-cybersecurity-firm-says
6,tiktok,Guardian,2023-04-20,"TikTok must divest itself of Chinese ownership or face ban, FCC commissioner tells Australian inquiry","TikTok will either need to divest itself from Chinese ownership or face a ban in the United States, according to the commissioner of the US federal communications commission, Brendan Carr, who accused the company of “gaslighting” the public on surveillance concerns. Appearing before the Australian Senate inquiry into foreign influence through social media, the Trump appointee said concern about TikTok in the US was “broad and deep”, and crossed party lines. Following the United Kingdom, Australia and other countries’ ban of the app from government devices, the US is considering a full ban nationally. Legislation enacting a statewide ban was recently passed in Montana. TikTok has attempted to head off any potential ban by moving US user data to third-party servers within the country. It is also allowing its source code to be scrutinised by US tech firm Oracle, which will screen TikTok app updates. Carr told the committee while that was ultimately an issue being handled by the US Treasury department, there was a common view among Democrats and Republicans that the data could not be prevented from being accessed by Chinese government officials under the 2017 national security law. Carr, the most senior Republican member on the FCC, said only an outright ban of the app in the United States or removing all corporate ties to China would be acceptable. “Ultimately, I think some sort of … legislation that imposes a ban or a genuine divestiture is the way forward right now,” he said. “The argument that somehow TikTok is going to stand up to the CCP is belied by their inability to do it at any point in time publicly. For instance, when asked in US media interviews, whether they acknowledge the existence of the Uyghur genocide, their official on TV refused to address it.” Carr said that a Project Texas plan might work for other Chinese companies, but TikTok’s actions to date meant there was no trust for the United States. “We’ve had this years-long approach that strikes me is nothing short of a gaslighting in terms of their misrepresentations,” he said. A spokesperson for TikTok said divestment wouldn’t solve the problem if national security is the objective. “A change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access. The best way to address concerns about national security is with the transparent, US-based protection of US user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification, which we are already implementing.” The Australian government has announced no plans beyond the ban of TikTok from government devices, but the Coalition is likely to push the Labor government for more restrictions on the app. The chair of the inquiry and shadow home affairs minister, senator James Paterson, opened the hearing by saying that the inquiry would serve as a starting point on making Australians a harder target for foreign interference. “We cannot allow foreign authoritarian regimes to have unfettered access to the devices of millions of Australians and the powerful opportunity that offers them to influence our democracy,” he said. “The work starts today to make us a harder target against the threat of cyber enabled foreign interference.” TikTok this week issued a factcheck on claims made about the app, and denied that Australian user data could be accessed in China. The inquiry is holding initial hearings on Thursday and Friday, and is due to report back to parliament in August.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/20/tiktok-must-divest-itself-of-chinese-ownership-or-face-ban-fcc-commissioner-tells-australian-inquiry
7,tiktok,Guardian,2023-04-18,TikTok Australia has launched a factcheck on itself. But does it tell the full story?,"The Chinese social media app TikTok has been under fire recently. The Australian government announced a ban of the app on government-owned devices earlier this month. The ban has been implemented at a government level in other western countries including the US, the UK, New Zealand, Canada and France. On Monday, TikTok Australia published a self-described factcheck, titled The Truth About TikTok: Separating Fact from Fiction, on TikTok’s site and on LinkedIn. However, the report, Myth vs fact, did not tell the full story. We decided to take a close look at some of the company’s claims. On Chinese ownership The factcheck labels it a “myth” that “TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance Ltd, is Chinese owned”. In an attempt to downplay Chinese ownership, it says roughly 60% of its parent company, ByteDance, is owned by global institutional investors. The remainder is made up of employees across the globe (20%), as well as the company’s founder (20%), who TikTok describes as “a private individual and not part of any state or government entity”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But this confirms that at least 20% and likely much more of the company is, in fact, Chinese-owned. A submission to Australia’s parliamentary inquiry on foreign influence through social media claimed that the company’s founder, Zhang Yiming, “has links to provincial united front organisations in Fujian”. The CCP’s united front is a Chinese government organisation that works to advance the party’s interests – particularly abroad. TikTok has dismissed the research paper that formed the basis of the submission. On being headquartered in China The factcheck also labelled it a “myth” that “TikTok and ByteDance are headquartered in China”, saying “ByteDance does not have a single global headquarters”. ByteDance is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, but in the company’s appeal against the US official divestment order in 2020, ByteDance repeatedly described itself as a “Chinese-headquartered” company. The ‘manipulation’ of content TikTok claims it does not “[manipulate] content in a way that benefits the Chinese government or harms Australian interests”. The factcheck says the company “does not permit any government to influence or change its recommendation model” and that users can “find a variety of content and views expressed about certain political issues or events, including those which are critical of the Chinese government”. It is difficult to verify these claims because the TikTok algorithm that governs what users see on their “For You” page is secret. After the TikTok chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, appeared before US Congress earlier this year some users reported they began seeing pro-Chew videos in their feed, but TikTok denied the suggestion it was deliberating serving users pro-TikTok content and others said it was more likely a result of the app’s algorithm responding to users having pro-TikTok feelings. On censorship The company claimed it does not censor “TikTok content on behalf of the CCP or Chinese government”. But leaked moderator documents obtained in 2019 by the Guardian revealed TikTok had instructed its moderators to censor videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong. TikTok argued at the time that the documents were outdated. National intelligence law TikTok labelled it a “myth” that “under its 2017 National Intelligence law, the Chinese government can compel ByteDance to share Australian TikTok user data”. TikTok claims that Australian TikTok user data is stored in Singapore, Malaysia and the US, and is “subject to local laws”, arguing this would protect the China law being applied outside China. However, a Department of Homeland Security report argues the law can be applied to data held domestically in China or abroad. Data collection At least one of the claims in TikTok’s factcheck is well supported by the available evidence: that the app itself is “not unique in the amount of information it collects”. Social media companies of all stripes collect and share user data, a practice they defend as typical across the industry. As Guardian Australia reported last week, the ban on government employees downloading the TikTok app to their work devices may be rendered ineffective due to these data-sharing practices.",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/19/tiktok-australia-has-launched-a-factcheck-on-itself-but-does-it-tell-the-full-story
8,tiktok,Guardian,2023-04-18,"The disgusting food of TikTok: is it designed to eat, provoke – or arouse?","I have just ironed my husband a toasted sandwich like some kind of tradwife and to be honest, I’m disappointed with his reaction. Admittedly, there were a few issues. The steam didn’t help, plus I wrapped it in too much tinfoil, so the heat couldn’t penetrate. The main problem, though, was that holding an iron meant I automatically started ironing the package, pressing hard and going to and fro industriously. The result is flat, very flat. “We have a sandwich toaster,” my husband points out, holding the crepe-thin delicacy between finger and thumb. He should be thrilled: this is the closest I’ve come to cooking for him in months. He tries it, reluctantly. “It’s very soft. Did you put mustard in it?” “I thought it would help,” I say. “It doesn’t.” Unless you are a particularly online person, you are probably asking why, at this point. It’s a question I have asked myself repeatedly, in a rising pitch of incredulity and distress as I dived deep into TikTok food – or FoodTok, if you will. Because that is where the ironed toastie comes from: it’s part of a new generation of TikTok recipe hacks that embody a provocative, frankly deranged “why not?” philosophy. We’ve come a long, wrong way since 2021’s viral feta pasta. Now, in addition to ironed toasties, you can enjoy a beatifically smiling blonde putting dried pasta in a blender to create an approximation of flour, then adding an egg to create a sort of dough. She then fashions lumpy, fat noodles, which she boils, tops with tomato sauce and declares “exactly like fresh pasta”. Comments include the likes of “YOU VIOLATED THE PASTA”, “Ma’am, blink twice if someone is holding you hostage” and many irate Italians. But that is not even as bad as the unholy tacos made by boiling beef, eggs and cheese in a bag of Doritos. There’s a whole genre of sponsored-by-diabetes content, where beautiful, young, slim women combine terrifying quantities of marshmallows, sweets, chocolate, butter, cereal, preprepared cookie dough and the like into “incredible” desserts that should be illegal. Many videos are titled: “Why am I just finding out about …” to which the answer is surely: “Because it should be on trial at The Hague.” You can watch people boil up crisps to make mashed potato, or dump uncooked dried pasta in the oven covered in a house-brick sized portion of cream cheese and a jar of sauce. Dry packet ramen oven-baked in tomato sauce and cheese is called “pizza” (I worry for Italy’s collective blood pressure). How about marinading chicken in the sink, or massaging mountains of mac and cheese on a worktop? “Everybody’s so creative!” TikToker @Tanaradoublechocolate, who seeks out culinary atrocities to comment upon, says. At the risk of sounding like Grampa Simpson yelling at clouds – which is exactly how I feel exploring FoodTok – what is going on? “There’s a long and storied history of gross-out food on social media,” says Chris Stokel-Walker, social media expert and the author of TikTok Boom. Twisted, the social media food brand that just announced a collaboration with Iceland, started out in 2016 and dared us to make the likes of deep-fried barbecue chicken-stuffed pizzadilla. Now, says Stokel-Walker, “It’s been supercharged by the arrival of TikTok.” The app is designed and engineered to “capture people’s attention as they are scrolling through that endless feed of content” and one good way to do it is precisely “the outlandish, the gross-out”. It is a notion echoed by Jonah Berger, professor at the Wharton school in Pennsylvania and bestselling author of Contagious, a study of social transmission and virality, who notes that these videos combine surprise and often disgust. “The more surprising something is, the more likely we are to share it with others. And disgust is a high arousal emotion that also causes us to pass things on.” So is this content engineered to provoke? Some of it, definitely. “I never work to appear genuine,” says Eli Betchik of @elis_kitchen, the self-proclaimed “most evil chef on TikTok”. “If anyone asks, I say: ‘Yeah, I do this for attention.’ I think it’s pretty obvious I do.” It is a mark of Betchik’s evil genius that every video of theirs makes me shout “No!” in genuine anger at some point. Betchik was behind the much-reviled potato crisp mash, and a horrifying sandwich made of blended peas, pineapple, cheese and nuts, with the bread coated with mayo, then fried, among other outrages. Betchik is a fine art jeweller, who started their channel after discovering TikTok at jewellery school. “I thought, I already love experimenting with food and trying new things – I could probably take that a few steps further and use it for some good old-fashioned shock-value entertainment.” Their first video was fried mayonnaise. I make a strangled noise hearing this. “Yeah, it was horrible,” confirms Betchik. Another early favourite was meatballs boiled in lime juice “until the juice was a thick syrup. I’m salivating because I can still taste the sourness. It was the most violent flavour I’ve ever had.” Outrage is the point, and, Betchik says, people enjoy feeling it. “Obviously, what I’m doing is to gross people out, but people keep coming back – they wouldn’t keep coming back if they didn’t get something out of it. I find that sometimes people get happy when they’re upset in the right way.” On their jewellery TikTok account @eli_metal, Betchik says, a mean comment would take days to digest, but with the food, it’s a mark of success. The one comment they won’t accept is that these horrendous creations are wasteful: impressively, worryingly omnivorous, Betchik finishes almost everything. In addition, “I try to use foods that are close to going bad or things that have been donated to me. And if I can’t eat it, I compost all the scraps.” It’s not clear if this level of diligence is common practice among the creators, but it feels doubtful. Mean commenters on the @myjanebrain TikTok account include a certain Gordon Ramsay, who angrily described a chicken stuffed in a pumpkin, garnished with cinnamon sticks and many onions as “Halloween salmonella right there.” “It was pretty awesome,” says Jane, a preternaturally cheery 27-year-old Canadian and full-time content creator who prefers not to give her surname, perhaps for fear of reprisals from Italians angered by her ramen “pizza”. “But I know the chicken was fully cooked. It was moist, it had great flavour.” Jane ended up in the realm of what is sometimes called “rage-bait” cooking accidentally. Her early videos, she says, were straight instructional content, but she pivoted when her fried chicken recipe went viral. “It got 31m views, 3,000 comments,” says Jane – this is, of course, highly populated TikTok territory, the hashtag #FoodTikTok had accumulated 112bn views by the end of 2022, for example. “I thought it would be positive but it was more like: ‘You’re the worst chef I’ve ever seen.’ So I realised that I would have no idea what people were going to think of my videos.” She started focusing on finding the “craziest combinations”, including one titled “I learned this hotdog trick in England”, in which she makes jelly from pickle juice, adds frankfurters and eats it in a bread bun. “That is absolutely not English,” I challenge her hotly, TikTok commenter style. “I can’t remember; it was from some sort of British something,” she says. “I was going to ask you why you make pickle juice jelly!” What makes people angriest, though, she says, is her cooking techniques. “As soon as you cook for the internet you open yourself up to all the critics who are so specific in the way they cook.” Both Jane and Eli are clear that their content is knowingly provocative rather than instructional, whether viewers understand that or not. “A lot of people take this content at face value when you have to remember we’re through the looking-glass on social media, where these things are being deliberately gamed for the benefit of those that create it,” says Stokel-Walker. All attention is good attention, since views and shares – including the genre of angry or incredulous “duet” videos where other creators (including Ramsay) comment on their depravity – are the point. That’s how you make money after all: successful TikTokers can become part of the app’s creator fund and get paid – admittedly pennies – per view. Stokel-Walker says that success can allow creators to pivot to the kind of genuinely lucrative mainstream collaborations that Twisted has managed. There is another possibly upsetting angle: fetish. “Videos where they point a lot and touch things and make super-repulsive stuff are apparently fetish,” a baker friend tells me airily, when I inquire if she uses TikTok recipes. It turns out there’s a fairly widespread suspicion this is a thing. The messier foods could fulfil a “sploshing” fetish: getting sexual gratification from food mess. “I’ve seen this aired,” says Stokel-Walker. “Certainly, it appeals to your senses. It’s like a slow-motion car crash in food form, where you’re like, how more disgusting can this get?” TikTok user @lenarae.lh analyses food videos and pronounces them fetish or non-fetish on the basis of how the women – it is almost always women – use their hands, splash or squirt stuff suggestively or massage phallic things. A friend also directs me to the work of a creator called @cedriklorenzen who specialises in whacking pieces of raw meat, dribbling, drizzling and taking his top off. It’s a better appetite suppressant than Ozempic: after watching, I never want to eat, have sex, or indeed see anything again. There is actually plenty of good, normal food on TikTok. Asking around, people mention recipes for homemade crispy chilli sauce, broccoli pasta, sesame dip and various noodle dishes they’ve tried, then added to their repertoire. Seema Pankhania, a 25-year-old former chef de partie at Gordon Ramsay’s Lucky Cat who posts as @seemagetsbaked, has 1.3 million followers for her eminently achievable, delicious-looking recipes. They are pleasingly lo-fi, especially her pyjama recipes for hungover, no bones days and ultra simple versions of Indian classics – her butter chicken has 1.7m likes (she also recommends her “super simple creamy chicken curry”. But even Pankhania, a proper cook, is aware it is all grist to the gnat’s attention span TikTok mill. She aims to keep videos under a minute long (“the shorter the better; people are going to get bored”) and has no illusions that much of the food content is only meant to be consumed with the eyes. “There’s a whole other field of cooking on TikTok which is indulgent,” she says, giving the example of elaborate lasagnes. “Nobody is going to make it, but it’s very nice and satisfying to watch.” Clearly that goes for the bizarre and the gross-out stuff too in some more depraved way. “At the end of the day, social media is entertainment, right?” says Pankhania. “Most of it is just for entertainment and people aren’t actually going to be cooking a lot of it.” Given much of food TikTok isn’t meant to be cooked, or is intentionally tongue in cheek, I’m sure I’m missing the point entirely as I cram half a packet of spaghetti into my blender. A flimsy thing, it protests loudly with an ominous smell of burning rubber. I whiz up vermicelli instead, dump the “flour” on the worktop and add an egg, making a claggy mess. I have to add normal flour – surely invalidating the whole madness – to form a dough ball capable of being rolled out. The resultant approximate noodles are dumped in boiling water. I take them out based on vibes alone – TikTok recipes are wildly unspecific – then my family gather to taste and criticise. My husband – whose former student staple of peas and camembert prepared in a kettle would be a runaway TikTok hit – declares it raw. “It’s not terrible,” one son ventures. “It’s not good either,” says the other, correctly. I dare not attempt anything of Betchik’s, and Jane recommends her own recipe for cinnamon buns baked in cream and coffee, topped with sugar, butter and flattened toffees – but I am 48 and my organs will explode if I eat that. My wimp’s version – a vegan bun sliced and covered in oat cream, sugar and cinnamon – comes out of the oven ominously black; my just deserts for messing with the recipe, I suppose. I eat it all anyway – it’s a cinnamon bun and cream, what’s not to like? – then, exhausted and hyperglycaemic, I close TikTok, hopefully for good. Everybody’s so creative! I wish they weren’t.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/18/the-disgusting-food-of-tiktok-is-it-designed-to-eat-provoke-or-arouse
9,tiktok,Guardian,2023-04-16,Supermarket sweep: how TikTok can help you save money on your food shopping,"Before Rachel Nixon goes to the supermarket, she sketches a quick shopping list in her head. In the garage she usually has a sack of potatoes, and meat, green veg and bread in the freezer. For the bits in between, she will head either to her local, membership-only brand discounter, the Company Shop in Barnsley, or to a mainstream supermarket such as Aldi. “Today I’m going with a £50 budget to feed five of us – £10 a day, £2 per person per meal. I’ll go home and look at what I’ve got in the freezer, check the rice, pasta. It’s make do and mend.” Unlike other shoppers, Nixon has a press pass, because when she’s filling her basket, she will also be filming a TikTok on her phone, and the Company Shop management requires permission. Her content, which “began as a joke”, follows her around the aisles, scrutinising produce and bargains against the biggest question at any supermarket in 2023: how can this cost this much? At many mainstream shops, Nixon says: “A £50 shop is now an £80 shop. People in the middle are floundering around.” Inflation is something everyone has noticed – even Cardi B went online to decry the price of American lettuce – but not everyone feels the impact at the checkout. If you are experiencing the pinch, TikTok’s intuitive “For You” page will be a disjointed research trip to the country’s supermarkets, trailing behind the trolley in the company of total strangers who share information that used to be a stable and private part of our lives – what we spend on food. “Come shopping with me at Lidl.” “Realistic food haul from Aldi.” “£58 shop at M&amp;S.” “FarmFoods underrated gems.” The scroll goes deep into the massive digital gumbo of TikTok, where the simple act of spending and saving money at the supermarket has dug a deep content stream – in global lifetime counts, #shopwithme has amassed 3.9bn views and #costofliving 1.5bn views, according to figures from TikTok, which is owned by the ByteDance company, headquartered in China. With these shoppers, you watch as they pick out a weekly food shop, formulating a guess for the receipt reveal at the end. You’ll hear a soundtrack of trolley rattles and packaging rustling off the shelves as someone you’ll never meet explains they’re not buying gravy this week (there’s some in the freezer), and they won’t be picking up bread because they’re gluten-free and Pete who does eat bread is on a work trip. The receipt reveal has become a grimly unpredictable game, since inflation has been repricing foodstuffs at the fastest rate since 1977 and in lurid proportions, particularly for lower-priced items such as pasta, tea and bread. Of course, as Nixon says: “It’s not just food. The cost of gas, electric, breathing – everything has gone up. When will something give? We all have households to run.” The government’s official figures saw food inflation rise to 18.2% in the year to January 2023, based on about 200 items in a representative basket. Other bodies such as the Food Foundation use a different basket of goods, and put food inflation higher. I’ve seen TikTokers joke about taking out a mortgage to buy butter, but generally speaking the social undertow of the videos is far from funny. The unwritten template for the #shopwithme videos is based on honesty: what’s going in the basket and why, and how much it costs. Honesty, but also disbelief. Jayne, a twentysomething teacher, describes her area of Cambridgeshire as relatively affluent, and with two incomes and no dependents in her household, she and her partner can afford a £300 monthly food budget, which they direct mostly to M&amp;S Foodhalls. “M&amp;S is quite small, so I get less distracted. Tesco has clothing, candles, I don’t think I’d be as disciplined. I just stick to my list.” This became the focus of her TikTok account, almost entirely a run of her routine supermarket shops at M&amp;S. “There isn’t a place [like TikTok] where people are sharing such an intimate part of their life. I’ve seen videos on what it costs to run a two-bed household in Wiltshire – there’s a natural curiosity from people, and if you’re willing to share parts of your life, it takes away from the unrealistic glamour of social media. I can’t believe how much people are interested in what’s going into the basket. I never expected the videos to do well,” says Jayne. This curiosity seems to be a consequence of missing information: though the internet may tell us the average person spends about £40 a week on food, that doesn’t seem right – or to put it another way, it feels as though the average figure is lying to us. When an industrial park can make neighbours of supermarkets that are miles apart in cost and branding, it begins to seem like there is no point to an average figure, when differences between prices are also cultural distances. “It costs a bomb to live in London,” says Nishat Tahsin, a biotech/bioengineering doctoral student who joined TikTok during lockdown, and now has more than 200,000 followers. Her content is about cooking imaginatively on a budget (think butter chicken puff pastry pie, or Bangladeshi satni citrus salad), but also organising grocery shopping habits. “I never used to have a food budget, but now it’s more expensive to live I always make a plan at the weekend for what I’m doing during the week. Loads of students prioritise study, then food later. I look at what I have in the freezer, then the costs that would come with it to make a meal.” At the beginning of each term, she bulk buys starches and bakery goods, adding fresh foods along the way in smaller shops, and heading to Asian or African markets for spices by the kilo. “I can do a weekly shop for under £20. A whole chicken for £3, go splits with flatmates on potatoes and onions, buy bread, cheese, milk, maybe a bit of nutmeg. But that’s because I buy essentials every few months.” For the freezer, she flat-packs meat portions and fish fillets, and grates up cheese blocks so high-value protein is never wasted. Tahsin isn’t like her friends in this regard – she notes how many students have been buying toilet paper on TikTok (bales of 60 rolls for as little as £18), and “they’re buying things left, right and centre on TikTok Shop. They don’t want to spend the time and money at Asda.” TikTok itself has inverted the surface logic of spontaneous buying on the platform by investing in a campaign around its library of money-saving tips. And brands that approach Tahsin also want a part of the problem. “Every time I do a brand deal they mention their new USP would be combating the cost of living crisis.” Over time, I noticed a lot of people on TikTok name-checking specific brands, and began to wonder if campaign spend was behind it. M&amp;S Foodhalls, for example, is getting traction on a “this is surprisingly affordable” theme on #shopwithme TikTok. The brand confirmed all the content is organic and not paid for, but says it has noticed a “huge surge” of it in recent months. Even an official Waitrose TikTok account gamely had a go at joining the £20-a-week family shop trend. The question is, does this help anyone? Dr Sinéad Furey is a lecturer in consumer management and food innovation at Ulster University, focused on food insecurity. “There is no substitute for food,” she says bluntly. “But we are still talking about not knowing where the next meal comes from. For every one of us who goes to a food bank, there are nine of us who don’t. Stigma, pride, whatever. Food insecurity isn’t acute; it is chronic.” For her research, she followed a cohort of 60 shoppers and analysed their supermarket habits. “There’s a huge reliance on shopping lists to frame or curtail your spend,” she says. “There is nobody better than those in lower-income households at micromanaging budgets. They know the price of a pint of milk across different stores and they know when the yellow stickers go on. It annoys me that there’s a presumption that lower-income consumers are bad with their money.” Shona Goudie at the Food Foundation leads the organisation’s Basic Basket programme, which has been tracking food prices based on baskets of goods at Tesco, as developed by Loughborough University and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation for male and female archetypal shoppers. “The government looks at food price inflation but we don’t feel it reflects what people are really buying, or the nutrition factor. We started tracking prices a year ago, and it’s increased 22% in that period.” Mitch Lane is a nuts and bolts salesman who lives near Walsall, in the West Midlands. Like Tahsin, he joined TikTok during lockdown, at the request of his daughter: “She wanted another follower,” he says. “I was mostly doing the dad dances and press-up challenges. But one day I was cooking up a chilli con carne and [the video] went really well. I started to do “fakeaways” – how to make your own Nando’s, burgers. Simple stuff, one-pan meals.” This developed into a budget-conscious series of cookery ideas, under the moniker “Meals by Mitch”, with the shopping receipt under £5 shown first, and the method to follow. “As the cost of living developed into an absolute joke, I kept seeing budget meals where people drizzled balsamic vinegar from their pantry. I don’t have a pantry. I wanted to do everything for a flat fiver.” Lane has picked up 1.2m followers and a book deal, and he is certain that “the cost of living has propelled it”. Other TikTokers who share photogenic techniques for prepping breakfast, lunch and dinner into neat ranks of Tupperware boxes or elongating the lifespan of lemons in jars of fridge water have also enjoyed success. But Lane wants to keep things grounded in reality. “I’ve lived on a budget most of my life. It’s not new to me. If I walked into a supermarket with a fiver, I used to get more. The budget meals are getting harder, whether it’s the price per kilo for veggies or the pasta and dried foods. People are finding it tough.” Fraser Reynolds, a personal trainer based near Stirling, Scotland, started filming calorie-minded food TikToks from his mother’s “tiny council house kitchen – no gadgets”. This morphed into a recipe series he describes as “the poor man’s Joe Wicks”, with a popular stream of “12 meals for 20 quid”. However, he’s had to rethink this, “because I cannot keep it under the price. In the past three months I’ve struggled putting it together because to keep it under £20 I’m going to give you the main ingredients and assume you have the spices already at home.” Though TikTok is worryingly good at distracting attention with dogs pressing doorbells or Wisconsin grandmothers dispensing life wisdom, it is arguably one of the few sources of a public, open conversation about how far money goes across different sections of society. Not what it looks like, aspirationally, but what it looks like literally, with a weekly shop spread out on the kitchen countertop. “If people are showing the receipts and what they’ve bought, it definitely helps,” Lane says. “It’s good for people to see that if you write a list and stick to the brief, and are not dashing stuff into the trolley, and you base a shop around it, it’s a guaranteed money saver.” Does being on TikTok as a creator bring anything extra to the table? “TikTok – there ain’t really any money in it,” Lane says. “We’re talking such a minimal amount per view. I get £150 a month off it, something like that. You couldn’t live off it.” Nixon says she receives, as a “relative minnow” with 27,000 followers, about 12p a day from TikTok. Meanwhile, Tahsin has been thinking about “selling seasoning for cheaper than a supermarket on TikTok Shop”. For her, the platform is a creative and relatively kind place. “I get a lot of diversity in my comments. In the UK our generation is really open to trying anything. I get requests for oxtail Jamaican curry, or Turkish kebabs. A lot of British people will want to know how to make samosas. It’s nice that people are less critical on TikTok. People will eat anything when they’re hungry.” • This article was amended on 19 April 2023. An earlier version suggested Walsall was in Birmingham.

10,tiktok,Guardian,2023-04-14,Cracking method or recipe for disaster? The science behind a Labor senator’s TikTok microwave egg-in-foil hack,"Labor senator Helen Polley has raised eyebrows with an unusual technique for cooking hardboiled eggs. In an “egg hack” video posted to TikTok, the Tasmanian senator completely wrapped a raw egg in aluminium foil, submerged it in a plastic container of water, and said she microwaved it for six to seven minutes for a hard boil. “Every time I’m cooking them in my Canberra office … everyone’s just really taken aback, saying: you can’t put foil into the microwave!” Polley told Guardian Australia. “This is something I’ve been doing for probably 25 years, if not longer, and I’ve never had a mishap. “I didn’t perfect this,” the senator added. “It was my mother-in-law who demonstrated it to me many years ago.” Polley’s technique runs counter to general wisdom to avoid putting metal objects into microwaves. So how has the senator managed to avoid setting off fire alarms in Parliament House? Metal heads Microwaves are a frequency of electromagnetic radiation that work primarily by heating up the water molecules in food. Metals, on the other hand, absorb much less of this radiation, and tend to reflect most of the microwaves away from their surface. It’s why microwave ovens are entirely lined with metal, with a thin metal mesh embedded in their front doors. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Technically, a microwave oven is an example of what’s known as a Faraday cage, according to Prof Zdenka Kuncic, a physicist at the University of Sydney. “It’s preventing the electromagnetic radiation from seeping outside.” Exposing a metal object to microwave radiation will mean the metal absorbs some of it, but can also lead to electrostatic sparks, particularly if the metal is thin, pointed, or has sharp corners, as in the case of crumpled aluminium foil. “You really only need a very thin layer of metal to cause sparks,” Kuncic said. “Generally speaking, even if you had really thick metal, the absorption and the sparking would really only affect … the outermost layer.” US guidelines suggest aluminium foil can be used in the microwave in certain circumstances, such as using small pieces of smooth foil to “shield” parts of food so they don’t overheat. Kuncic said in Polley’s case, the water surrounding the egg-in-foil served two purposes. “One is to insulate the electrical sparks from the foil – to prevent them from flying around. The second thing is to actually help cook the egg, which would otherwise not really cook because it’s got foil around it.” “Microwaves work by jiggling around the all the water molecules. When you’ve got a little tub of water in there, it’s heating up the water,” she said. “The egg would be to some extent insulated by the foil directly from the microwaves, [but] the water surrounding it will heat up and that heat can get transferred through the foil into the egg to cook it.” Dr Nathan Kilah, a senior lecturer in chemistry at the University of Tasmania agreed: “The water there is basically preventing the aluminium from arcing [sparking] in a way that it normally would.” Eggsplosion risk In 2019, a contributor to a Woolworths community site detailed the same technique as Polley’s, but one of the respondents, who did not submerge the egg in water, warned: “Last year I blew up my new $600 microwave doing this.” Foil aside, whole eggs with shells are prone to explosion when cooked or heated in the microwave. One case report published in the British Medical Journal, titled “Penetrating ocular trauma from an exploding microwaved egg”, details the plight of a nine-year-old girl who reheated an already boiled egg with an intact shell “at full power for about 40 seconds”. “The heated egg was removed from the microwave oven and placed in a bowl. Around 30 seconds later, as she was carrying it to the dining area, the egg exploded with part of it hitting her right eye and face,” the report noted, going on to detail the eye surgery she subsequently required. Kilah explained: “The water in the egg turns to steam, and … it can’t escape from the shell, which leads to it exploding. The air space in the egg would also expand with the heat. “Adding an egg directly to boiling water can make it crack – so the air is expanding against the shell, but it’s not so dramatic, as the internal egg temperature doesn’t warm up as quickly.” A safer option for those who are insistent upon cooking their eggs in the microwave would be to crack the egg first and poach it in water.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/15/cracking-method-or-recipe-for-disaster-the-science-behind-senator-helen-polleys-tiktok-microwave-egg-in-foil-hack
11,tiktok,Guardian,2023-04-13,"TikTok can still access data from Australian government devices via app on personal phones, academic warns","TikTok could still access information held on Australian government devices if public servants and politicians continue to use the app on their personal mobile devices, according to a legal academic from the University of New South Wales. Dr Katharine Kemp, who focuses on consumer law and has researched a wide variety of privacy policies for digital apps, said the loophole could limit the effectiveness of the ban on TikTok from government devices. “If the employee uses their personal email address to log into apps on both their work phone and their personal phone, TikTok and the other company could match data from the two separate phones,” she said. This kind of data sharing is not exclusive to TikTok, and social media companies defend it as typical across the industry. Kemp said through collecting multiple data points related to a device, companies can then uniquely identify that device and track it in what is called “fingerprinting”. TikTok declined to comment, but the company’s privacy policy indicates information can be shared from other social media platforms in cases where that account is used to log in to TikTok, as is common practice with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Google accounts. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Last week the federal attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, announced that federal public servants and politicians with government-issued phones must delete the Chinese-owned app from their devices as soon as possible, and would not be permitted to install it except in limited circumstances. In announcing the ban, the government stated TikTok “poses significant security and privacy risks to non-corporate commonwealth entities arising from extensive collection of user data and exposure to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government that conflict with Australian law”. Last week the government faced criticism from the Greens for focusing on TikTok alone rather than the privacy concerns of all social media apps. Kemp said in order for the TikTok ban to be effective, the government would also need to ban data-matching between the apps. “Data security and privacy choices can’t be addressed by removing an app from a particular device,” she said. “TikTok and other digital platforms don’t just collect personal data from a single digital ‘location’. “They have collection points all over the place that feed information back to the platform, even when you use different devices for different apps.” A spokesperson for Dreyfus directed Guardian Australia to the department. The department spokesperson did not directly address the issues raised, but said the existing government device ban would “minimise the security and privacy risks posed by the TikTok application”. The opposition spokesperson on cybersecurity, Senator James Paterson, said the government ban was the first step. “Removing it was important but is not a panacea,” he said. “A comprehensive response which encompasses risks like these and also those posed by other applications is clearly necessary. I hope the Albanese government is doing that work right now.” The move to ban TikTok from government devices followed similar bans in other parts of the world including the UK, Canada, New Zealand and the US. The latter is contemplating a nationwide ban on the app. TikTok this week quietly launched an app for select Android-based TVs in Australia.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/14/tiktok-can-still-access-data-from-australian-government-devices-via-app-on-personal-phones-academic-warns

13,tiktok,Guardian,2023-04-08,Four TikTok creators weigh in on what a ban would mean for them,"TikTok is at an existential crossroads, facing an unprecedented global crackdown and a potential ban in the US – and TikTok creators are caught in the balance. The platform is under bipartisan scrutiny over allegations that its parent company ByteDance is influenced by the government of China, where it is based. But those concerns have yet to dull the public’s enthusiasm – with the app more popular than ever and now surpassing 150m active users in the US. The world of TikTok is unique and diverse, from people sharing videos of pets or conducting live ASMR shows, to building community around hobbies such as cooking and gardening. Creators have protested the ban outside Congress, saying it would diminish the ability to use TikTok to generate income, or as an educational and network-building tool. So how are these creators feeling about this moment? We asked a range of people to describe their experience on the app and what will happen if it goes away. Nathalie Adkins and her son, RJ Handle: @natlivingselfcare TikTok follower count: 53,300 followers Primary content: A cooking vlog in which Nathalie’s 9-year-old son RJ Nathan Phillips tries recipes from different cultures, sharing the process and results. How she and her son use TikTok: When I first got involved in TikTok, I was using it for information and tutorials. One day, my son said he wanted to make some noodles so I said, “OK, can I film you making some noodles?” It got such rave reviews, I started posting every time he cooks. It really brought him out of his shell because he’s neurodivergent and he’s not very expressive. Since we started this journey, all of a sudden he wants to do commentary, he wants to dance, he wants to plan his next video. The contrast has been amazing. It is easier to find community on TikTok. Now my son, a black boy from Los Angeles, has made 17 international dishes – it has connected him with communities of people from Armenia, Korea and China, that love him because he appreciates their culture. If anything were to happen to my son, as he grows into a young black man, I want people to see him as a human being. I want to know people will stand up for him. He won’t be alone. That’s why I do it. On how a ban would affect them: We will be OK, but it will make me feel some type of way about our government and my first amendment rights. It’s not just about TikTok, it is about how our elected officials are using their power to to keep us down. We will survive without TikTok, but it makes me anxious that they can take something like this away so quickly. On the wider impact: I have connected with a lot of Gen Z TikTokers who are ready to fight. It’s not just about TikTok – it’s about old people who don’t know anything about technology trying to restrict it. You’re going to turn a bunch of young people into political activists. Ross Pomerantz Handle: @corporate.bro TikTok follower count: 206,500 Primary content: Satirical videos about millennial corporate life How he uses TikTok: I got on TikTok about three years ago. I was like every millennial becoming the boomer they never thought they become – like, “This is for the kids. I don’t want to learn another platform.” But I put myself on and started making videos. It is fascinating because building a following doesn’t really matter – you can still go viral if you have no followers. So, in terms of making an income stream, it is less effort to make videos that perform well and in that regard, it’s been nice. It’s a great place to find new fans and gain new audiences. On how a ban would affect him: It would certainly hurt the the bottom line. But as a creator who uses multiple platforms, I won’t be as deeply impacted. It’s a great sandbox to play in, but the best content I make, I cross post. On the wider impact: I think the content creation style of TikTok will ultimately migrate to other platforms. People have assumed [the action against TikTok] has been a result of Meta lobbying – but I think YouTube will actually be the main benefactor. Who knows? Maybe a US-based copycat will pop up in TikTok’s place and we will be back where we started. People are going to be enraged for a few weeks like they are with any major issue. The question is: what they will do about it? Alexis Devine and Bunny the Dog Handle: @whataboutbunny TikTok follower count: 8.3m Primary content: Bunny the dog communicates with her caretakers using buttons that convey objects, ideas and feelings. How she uses TikTok: I started a TikTok account in early 2020 to document the success my dog Bunny was having communicating with programmable buttons. Developing an audience on TikTok happened very quickly and led to the development of a much larger community of humans using buttons to enable alternative methods of communication with their animal companions. Many of these people are now participants of a research study. I’m not sure that without TikTok that would have been possible. On how a ban would impact her: I make a little bit of money from the creator fund on TikTok. The loss of that income wouldn’t have a significant impact on my life at the moment, but as an independent contractor every little bit matters. On the wider impact: I don’t think there is a comparable platform at the moment and while creators and viewers will have no choice but to try and find other platforms and communities within which to thrive, it won’t be the same. I have learned so much from educational content on TikTok. Content that is niche, authentic, invaluable and the likes of which I haven’t found on other platforms. The loss of TikTok would be a huge blow not only to creators that depend on TikTok income, but also to me, a lifelong learner. Alexander Maupin Handle: @alex_makes1 TikTok follower count: 160,700 followers Primary content: Alexander produces a variety of content but has gained a large following for live videos in which they individually pop kernels of popcorn using a hair straightener. How they use TikTok: I do a little bit of everything. Last year, I was dealing with a lot of depression and anxiety and I came across another Live user who was popping popcorn, but it was very low-key and kind of an ASMR vibe. So I flipped the script and got colorful lights and a huge speaker. I just try to be as entertaining as possible. On how a ban would affect them: TikTok is more about community. I’ve met so many interesting people on TikTok with similar interests to me that I would have never met on Facebook or Instagram. If it disappeared, it would be really sad because I would lose a lot of friends overnight. On the wider impact: People are resilient – they will congregate somewhere else. There are 150m US users and that is going to give people a lot of idle time – it will be interesting to see what they will do with it. I think this will create more of a push for reform.

14,tiktok,Guardian,2023-04-08,TikTok to a Heinz jar: vodka pasta sauce’s journey from fad to supermarket shelves,"Sometimes you just need some vodka pasta sauce – especially when you’ve been grounded for trying to charter a helicopter on your dad’s credit card. When Sofia Coppola’s 16-year-old daughter, Romy Mars, set the internet alight last month after doing just that – and then recorded a TikTok video to complain about her punishment while making the sauce – there was plenty of discussion about her family dynamics. Others, though, were more interested in her food choices. Vodka pasta sauce has been a viral favourite among social media users since the model Gigi Hadid posted a how-to video to her Instagram stories in 2020, sparking an instant food craze among her fans. Two of those fans have now been revealed to be Heinz and the vodka brand Absolut, who have jointly launched a limited edition run of their own version of the sauce, which they say comes from their commitment to innovate “at the speed of social media trends”. Online fads driven by a brief celebrity clip might seem trivial but to retailers, especially in the highly competitive grocery sector, they are anything but. Vodka pasta sauce is far from the only viral craze to have found itself on supermarket shelves in recent years. Pasta chips, cloud bread, and an alarming bubblegum-coloured condiment called “pink sauce” have all made the journey from wildly popular videos to mainstream product lines. TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, in other words, are not just where brands’ customers are – they are also potentially where their next product ideas can be found. “Traditionally with product development, you would get people together, ask them some questions and develop products on the back of that,” says Jamie Ray, a co-founder of Buttermilk, a specialist brand and influencer agency. “But now the speed of information is all driven by social. “For brands, it’s about looking at what is making viral moments, [then thinking], OK, influencers are dictating that this trend is really going somewhere, we need to incorporate that in our next line of products.” One clear example is that of Twisted, which has just launched its own branded range of social media-friendly foods – think foot-long pigs in blankets on spits and lasagne-filled yorkshire puddings – with the frozen supermarket giant Iceland. Twisted began in 2016 when Tom Jackson and a friend began filming food videos from their flat in Brixton and posting them on Facebook, inspired by a philosophy they sum up as “unserious food tastes seriously good”. “And yeah, within nine weeks, we had a million followers on Facebook,” says Jackson. Now a fully fledged social media company, they have a core team of content producers, a cookbook, a publishing arm and 40 million followers across all social media platforms. More than 60% of those watching say they have tried a Twisted recipe at home, making the crossover appeal to established retailers obvious. “It’s not just about being viral, or at least not any more. It’s tangible, you’re reaching inside the screen, and you can actually eat it,” Jackson says. “And while the products are fun, or might sound a bit wacky, they taste delicious.” Engaging with social media can flop as well as fly, notes Dom Boyd, the managing director of UK insights and marketing at the retail analysts Kantar, who points out that a quarter of adverts bought on digital platforms have zero or negative effects. Interactions must be authentic for a brand’s demographic, he says, “otherwise you’re the dad at the disco”. And while the buying power of young, digital-native consumers can be huge, it is often poorly understood, says Helenor Gilmour, the director of insight and strategy at the kids insight consultancy Beano Brain. The retail influence of Generation Alpha (under 13) consumers, for instance, extends way beyond viral crazes such as the YouTuber-promoted Prime energy drinks – which have resulted in shoppers queueing for hours to grab a bottle – to influence even the car market, she says. Recent research from Beano Brain found that 69% of Gen A’s parents say they make better decisions about the planet because of their young children. “It’s not unusual for us to hear of kids influencing not just the brand of car but even the shift to electric cars.” Don’t assume, however, that it’s only young social media fans driving product development, says Ellis Hawthorne, features editor at Retail Week. “You can’t discount even baby boomers from a seeing food viral videos, even though they may not be on TikTok. These videos are making their way around Instagram and Facebook too – and that generation are frequently on Facebook.” She cites pink gin as a now-mainstream product line where its development was driven by older social media users. For most major brands, online trends are now “completely ingrained” into their product development, Hawthorne says, “But you have to remember that these viral trends are a very, very small part of their businesses. “If you think about the average person going in and doing their weekly shop – whether they saw a TikTok about feta pasta isn’t going to be really that relevant to the bottom line of these companies.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/08/instagram-tiktok-heinz-vodka-pasta-sauce-social-media-food-brands

16,tiktok,Guardian,2023-04-04,TikTok fined £12.7m for illegally processing children’s data,"TikTok has been fined £12.7m for illegally processing the data of 1.4 million children under 13 who were using its platform without parental consent, Britain’s data watchdog said. The information commissioner said the China-owned video app had done “very little, if anything” to check who was using the platform and remove underage users, despite internal warnings the firm was flouting its own terms and conditions. “Our findings were that TikTok were not doing enough to prevent under-13s accessing their platform, they were not doing enough when they became aware of under-13s to get rid of them, and they were not doing enough to detect under-13s on there,” John Edwards told the Guardian on Tuesday. “They assure us that they are now doing more.” The fine from the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) comes weeks after the app was banned from UK government phones amid security concerns. It is fast becoming a flashpoint for the UK’s handling of big tech and Chinese influence. After the announcement of the fine, one of the largest the watchdog has given, Rishi Sunak was accused of moving too slowly in taking action against TikTok – and was called “naive for assuming TikTok could ever regulate itself”. UK data protection law does not have a strict ban on children using the internet but requires organisations that use the personal data of children to obtain consent from their parents or carers. TikTok itself bans those under 13 in its terms and conditions. The failure to enforce age limits led to “up to 1.4 million UK children” under 13 using the platform as of 2020, the ICO estimated. “There was a whole bunch of stuff that they could have been doing that they weren’t,” Edwards said. “All that was required was a self-certification that the applicant was over 13, by clicking a box with no verification, with no extra checks. We understand that there are now significantly more checks and balances in place to detect that kind of thing.” Edwards added: “There are laws in place to make sure our children are as safe in the digital world as they are in the physical world. TikTok did not abide by those laws. “As a consequence, an estimated 1 million under-13s were inappropriately granted access to the platform, with TikTok collecting and using their personal data. That means that their data may have been used to track them and profile them, potentially delivering harmful, inappropriate content at their very next scroll. “TikTok should have known better, TikTok should have done better. They did not do enough to check who was using their platform or take sufficient action to remove the underage children that were using their platform.” The ICO’s investigation found that concern was raised internally but that TikTok did not respond “adequately”. In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson said: “TikTok is a platform for users aged 13 and over. We invest heavily to help keep under-13s off the platform and our 40,000-strong safety team works around the clock to help keep the platform safe for our community. “While we disagree with the ICO’s decision, which relates to May 2018 to July 2020, we are pleased that the fine announced today has been reduced to under half the amount proposed last year. We will continue to review the decision and are considering next steps.” TikTok emphasised that it had changed its practices since the period the ICO investigated. Now, in common with social media peers, the site uses more signals than a users’ self-declared age when trying to determine how old they are, including training its moderators to identify underage accounts and providing tools for parents to request the deletion of their underage children’s accounts. The accusations also pre-date the introduction of the ICO’s “age appropriate design code”, which specifies an even stricter set of rules that platforms are expected to follow when handling the personal data of children. That code also makes it more explicit that platforms cannot argue ignorance over the ages of younger users as a defence for failing to treat their personal data carefully. “We will be looking at other providers of services likely to be accessed by children and checking the ways in which they’re doing age verification,” Edwards said. In 2019, TikTok was hit with a $5.7m fine by the US Federal Trade Commission for similar practices. That fine, a record at the time, was also levied against TikTok for improper data collection from children under 13. At the time the company committed to improving its practices and said it would begin keeping younger users in “age-appropriate TikTok environments”, where those under 13 would be pushed into a more passive role, able to watch videos, but not post or comment on the platform. John Hayes, a Conservative MP who pushed Sunak to toughen up the online harms bill, warned the government it would be forced to return to the issue of regulation “time and again because the idea that companies like TikTok will ever regulate themselves is for the birds”. Labour has accused the government of failing to protect children online. Alex Davies-Jones, the shadow digital and tech minister, said: “Ministers have been passing the buck and platforms have been acting with impunity.” She added: “The government and tech companies have a clear responsibility to ensure young people are safe online and this episode shows they are failing that duty. Labour has long campaigned for stronger protections online and if this government fails to act the next Labour government will.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/04/tiktok-fined-uk-data-protection-law-breaches
17,tiktok,Guardian,2023-04-04,ABC to review use of TikTok after app banned from Australian government devices,"The ABC is reviewing its use of TikTok following the federal government’s ban of the Chinese-owned social media app on government-issued devices. The ban announced by the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, on Tuesday only applies to non-corporate government entities, meaning a range of government-owned businesses and agencies are not subject to the ban, including the ABC, SBS, Australia Post and NBN Co. However it is likely to have flow-on effects to government and non-government businesses. A spokesperson for the ABC confirmed that in light of the ban, the ABC was reviewing its use of the platform. “The ABC will review current use of the platform on ABC devices following the government’s decision to prohibit the TikTok app on devices issued by commonwealth departments and agencies,” a spokesperson said. “The ABC has a suite of cybersecurity protocols, which include measures and policies relating to the use of social media applications on ABC devices.” As with most media outlets, the ABC publishes news on TikTok among other social media platforms. The spokesperson said the ABC has “an ongoing dialogue” with the Australian Cyber Security Centre on threats and vulnerabilities, and will work with the government as more information about the ban is made available. Australia Post has confirmed it is also “reviewing the TikTok direction and considering any potential implications”. A spokesperson for NBN Co said it ceased using TikTok for corporate social media communications earlier this year and is reviewing the use of TikTok by employees on company-issued mobile devices. SBS declined to comment on whether it was reviewing its use of the platform in light of the government’s decision. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The government’s protective security direction states TikTok “poses significant security and privacy risks to non-corporate commonwealth entities arising from extensive collection of user data and exposure to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government that conflict with Australian law”. Exemptions are available for government entities which can demonstrate a “legitimate business reason … which necessitates the installation or ongoing presence of the application”. A legitimate business reason could include countering misinformation or disinformation, or “to reach key audiences to undertake marketing or public relations activity on behalf of the entity”. All members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network – Australia, Canada, the US, the UK and New Zealand – have now banned the app from government devices. France, Belgium and the European Commission have announced bans. The Victorian and ACT governments have also announced they will impose similar bans. Several federal government departments, including home affairs, foreign affairs and trade, education, finance, the National Disability Insurance Agency and the Australian Electoral Commission had already imposed bans within their departments, ahead of the government’s blanket announcement. TikTok’s chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, in testimony before the US Congress last month, consistently denied the app shares data, spies on people or has connections with the Chinese Communist party. TikTok’s Australia and New Zealand general manager, Lee Hunter, said TikTok should not be singled out. “There is no evidence to suggest that TikTok is in any way a security risk to Australians and should not be treated differently to other social media platforms,” Hunter said in a statement. He said TikTok was “extremely disappointed” by the decision and it was “driven by politics, not fact”. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said the Coalition would support government decisions to keep Australian citizens safe, and which were “in our national interest”. “If the government has advice that it’s unsafe to have TikTok on those government phones then they’re acting on that advice and we would support that decision.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/05/abc-to-review-use-of-tiktok-after-app-banned-from-australian-government-devices
18,tiktok,Guardian,2023-04-04,Afternoon Update: TikTok banned on government devices; Jarryd Hayne found guilty of sexual assault; and a huge beer spill in Montana,"Good afternoon. Australia has followed the US, Canada and New Zealand in banning TikTok from government devices. A few hours later, Victoria announced a similar ban, with the premier, Daniel Andrews, saying he would stop using the popular app. Meanwhile, mortgage holders have been given a reprieve with the Reserve Bank holding the cash rate at 3.6% – the first pause since the central bank began hiking rates last May. And cases of beer spill after a train derailment in Montana. Top news Australia’s TikTok ban | The government cited “significant security and privacy risks … arising from extensive collection of user data”, in its decision to ban the Chinese social media app. Interest rate pause | A lot has happened over the past month that may have influenced the RBA’s decision, from bank collapses and takeovers in the US and Switzerland, to inflation in Australia easing off at 6.8%. Jarryd Hayne guilty of rape | Former NRL star has been found guilty of sexually assaulting a woman on NRL grand final night in 2018 after a third trial jury deliberated for more than a week. Hayne, 35, pleaded not guilty to two counts of sexual intercourse without consent.

19,tiktok,Guardian,2023-04-04,Australia-wide ban of TikTok on government devices announced as senior politicians quit the app,"The Australian government has banned the use of Chinese social media app TikTok on government devices, following similar bans in other western countries. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said he had authorised the secretary of his department to issue a mandatory direction to prohibit the TikTok app on devices issued by commonwealth departments and agencies. “The direction will come into effect as soon as practicable,” he said. “Exemptions will only be granted on a case-by-case basis and with appropriate security mitigations in place.” According to the protective security direction issued with the ban, the government states TikTok “poses significant security and privacy risks to non-corporate Commonwealth entities arising from extensive collection of user data and exposure to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government that conflict with Australian law.” Last month the government received a review from the Department of Home Affairs on the security risks of all social media platforms and the correct government settings. Over half of all federal government agencies currently ban TikTok from government devices, but the overarching policy will ensure consistency across the government. The states and territories were advised of the planned ban on Monday. A Victorian government spokesperson said it would work to adopt the new restrictions on the use of TikTok, while a New South Wales government spokesperson said Cyber Security NSW would continue discussions with the federal government on the new position. TikTok was not informed about the proposed ban prior to it being leaked to media, the company’s Australia and New Zealand general manager Lee Hunter said. He said in a statement that TikTok was “extremely disappointed” by the decision, which the company said was “driven by politics, not fact”. “Again, we stress that there is no evidence to suggest that TikTok is in any way a security risk to Australians,” he said, adding that it should not be treated differently to other social media platforms. “Our millions of Australian users deserve a government which makes decisions based upon facts and who treats all businesses fairly, regardless of country of origin.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The shadow cybersecurity minister, James Paterson, told Sky News the government had been “very very late” in implementing the ban on government devices. The federal opposition had long been calling for the government to act, despite the Coalition failing to do so when in government less than a year ago. Paterson said most of the revelations around security concerns with TikTok and the subsequent government device bans by governments including the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand only occurred in the past few months. Paterson indicated the opposition would now push for a review on the use of TikTok on personal devices including opening up the possibility of a national ban – something the United States is currently considering. “It’s good that it’s going to be banned from government devices because it removes that espionage risk to public servants,” he said. “But the data privacy and security risks and also the foreign interference risks that affect millions of Australians using the platform are so far and yet not to be dealt with and they have to be dealt with.” He said that an outright ban of TikTok should be on the table because it could potentially force TikTok’s parent company ByteDance to consider divesting the company from Chinese control. Several MPs, including environment minister Tanya Plibersek and Labor MP Julian Hill, still use TikTok on nongovernment devices. Paterson said he does not use the app, and government services minister Bill Shorten and Victorian premier Daniel Andrews announced on Tuesday they would stop using TikTok. But Greens senator David Shoebridge said the ban wasn’t a serious reform because its focus was too limited. “If we’re not careful it will just be the first hammer blow in an endless game of online whack-a-mole,” he said. “We’re in a data security and privacy crisis and we’re fixated on one platform. “The data security issues for TikTok are mirrored in pretty much every other social media platform, the difference is that our government is not running a fear campaign against the governments that host those platforms.”",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/04/australia-wide-ban-of-tiktok-on-government-devices-announced-as-senior-politicians-quit-the-app
20,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-31,TikTok: why the app with 1bn users faces a fight for its existence,"Sitting at the heart of youth culture, TikTok is beloved of its more than 1 billion users worldwide. With a range of compelling content that extends from viral dances to comedy skits, cleaning hacks, BookTok, music and the Gen Z melancholy of the corecore trend, it is the app of the 21st century. But in the sphere of western politics, the Chinese-owned company is increasingly friendless – caught in a geopolitical standoff between the rise of China as a superpower and mistrust of Beijing in countries where so many of the short-video app’s users are based. As a consequence, TikTok faces a serious threat of deletion, with the US leading the charge. Here, the Guardian’s technology editors explain how TikTok became a social media sensation – and why politicians and health experts are now gunning for it. The phenomenon TikTok is enormously successful, on both sides of the Atlantic. The company’s chief executive, Shou Zi Chew (whose Singaporean heritage was emphasised when he testified in front of the US Congress last week), says the app has more than 150 million monthly active users in the US alone. In the UK, Ofcom data shows that this time last year the average TikTok user (of those older than 15) spent 29 minutes a day on the app, only slightly less than the time spent on Facebook and Messenger combined. Last year TikTok had 18 million users in the UK, according to the analytics firm data.ai. But for the company’s core demographic, aged between 15 and 24, engagement in the UK is through the roof: the average young adult TikToker spends almost an hour a day on the app. And while Instagram and YouTube have more absolute users, TikTok is catching up fast. In the first quarter of 2022 in the UK, 73% of 15- to 24-year-olds had used the app, vastly outstripping peers such as Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat. Comparable stats for 2023 are not yet available but every indication suggests that usage has risen further. This combination of attention span and demographics makes the app very appealing to advertisers, who spent more than $10bn (£8.1bn) on the platform last year, according to industry estimates. TikTok’s popularity is driven in part by the recommendation algorithm that drives its main feed, the “For You” page. The app seems to have an uncanny ability for working out what you like – and reels you in, hence that daily viewing time. Marc Faddoul, a director at AI Forensics, a European non-profit that investigates algorithms, says TikTok’s key advantage is its ability to build a detailed psychological and subject interest profile of users who scroll through endless videos, leaving a trail of revealing data. “What makes TikTok special and different to others is the rate at which it collects data from your interaction with it. If you spend an hour on TikTok, you are going to scroll through many hundreds – up to 1,000 – videos, and each view will generate data, such as length of viewing time, that allows TikTok to refine its targeting.” He adds that the way TikTok shows one video at a time across a mobile screen means a user’s scrolling behaviour generates “precise and rapid feedback” from every video. But that uncanny algorithm is also driving the very suspicion that could kill the app. That suspicion was heightened in the aftermath of Chew’s appearance in front of Congress last week. The morning after, users across the world reported a flood of “pro-Chew” videos appearing on their For You pages, and shared their suspicions that TikTok was artificially promoting content that supported its stance against the bans. TikTok denies any interference and says it did not promote the Chew clips. Others countered that the algorithm was simply reflecting the TikTok audience’s own pro-TikTok feelings. But the opacity that enables that suspicion is the same opacity that legislators worry could be weaponised by a Chinese state that has little regard for rule of law and a history of strong-arming commercial organisations into compliance. Security fears The security concerns around TikTok are threefold, according to Bryan Cunningham, a former White House lawyer and adviser to the US data security firm Theon Technology. They are: misuse of personal data gleaned from the app, which could be used to profile users who, for instance, work for foreign governments; using the app to infect a user’s device; and the Chinese Communist party using the app’s compelling algorithm to manipulate the For You feed and, thus, public opinion. Cunningham, and many other TikTok critics, point to Chinese security laws that require cooperation with the state, including a 2017 national security law in China that requires organisations and citizens to “support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work”. While Cunningham acknowledges that no definitive proof has been produced of Chinese state interference in TikTok, he says the concerns about the app’s data harvesting and its ownership are enough to warrant a move against it. “We don’t know if the sabotage aspect or the data exfiltration has happened,” he says. “But my view is it’s certainly all theoretically possible. And as far as I’m concerned, as a national security lawyer that’s enough for us to take action.” These worries have already led to a series of bans of TikTok on government-issued phones in countries including the US, Canada and the UK as well as in the EU’s executive arm, the European Commission. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a US government body that reviews foreign investment on national security grounds, has decided TikTok’s ties to China pose an unacceptable security risk of state interference, and has ordered ByteDance, TikTok’s Beijing-based parent company, to divest itself of the app or face a ban. If ByteDance refuses, or tries to spin off a diminished version of TikTok, then Americans could wake up one day to find their favourite app no longer exists. Any attempt to ban the app would be likely to prompt legal action against the US government – TikTok successfully fought off similar moves by the Trump administration in 2020. TikTok says it is pushing ahead with a data security plan that appears to have been rejected by the US government, which involves user data being stored on third-party servers owned by the US tech firm Oracle, with that same company vetting app updates that are sent to the Apple and Android app stores. It has also announced a similar plan for the storage of European data. However, what the US does with TikTok is influential elsewhere. Before the UK government announced a TikTok ban on official phones, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: “We look at what our allies are doing.” In the US, momentum is clearly building towards further action against the app. A TikTok spokesperson said recent government bans were “based on fundamental misconceptions and driven by wider geopolitics” in which the app played no part. “We remain committed to working with governments and partners to address any security concerns, but ask to be judged on facts, not fears, and treated equally to our competitors,” they said. There has been no definitive proof of critics’ concerns about TikTok, but several news stories have raised doubts. In 2019, the Guardian revealed that TikTok’s moderation guidelines helped promote Beijing’s view of foreign policy, while last year BuzzFeed reported that China-based employees at ByteDance had accessed nonpublic data about US TikTok users. Then in December, TikTok’s credibility was damaged when ByteDance admitted that employees had used the app to spy on reporters. TikTok’s privacy policy is clear that it accesses, among other things, your email address, your contacts, your direct messages, payment details and location. That is not substantially different from other social media apps such as Instagram. But other social media apps do not have to be as squeaky clean in the way that TikTok does if it is to allay fears. Health concerns Security is not the only issue facing TikTok – there are growing anxieties about the effect it has on users’ mental health. In some respects, they echo the concerns raised with other social media platforms, and relate to its recommendation algorithm and teen mental health. For instance, last year an EU-backed study by academics and clinicians on young people and internet-related mental health set out some of the problems. The study interviewed a British 17-year-old girl with a history of binge-eating disorders and suicidal behaviours, who said she was able to access content teaching people how to become anorexic via typing in a hashtag. She said users found a way to circumvent TikTok’s moderators, including putting content about eating disorders in the comment section. “[To make sure] they don’t get taken down, the video itself, what they do is they say: ‘Look in the comments for this.’ So, it’s just music playing in the background, an empty screen and look at the comments. You open up the comments and the comments section is full of these random people giving you eating disorder tips … And it’s like sharing stuff in secret ways that I’ve realised, yes, people are really good at finding stuff like that.” A 16-year-old British boy in the same study said his use of TikTok resembled an addiction. “It’s not that it was not fun, it was consuming a lot of my time and I really disliked it. I deleted it before, but I ended up getting it again because I got an addiction to it in a way.” The report’s lead author, Prof Sonia Livingstone at the London School of Economics, says even well-balanced teenagers that she talks to struggle to “pull away” from the app. She adds: “Young people tell me over and again that they have a sense of compulsion to stay on the app, to see the next thing and the next thing, because the videos are short, attention grabbing and because they are popular.” Livingstone says she has spoken to young people who try to create “coping strategies” such as “following happier hashtags to balance the flow of content they are served”. She adds that young TikTok users find it “quite scary” how their interaction with the platform is being measured. Further research published last year suggests TikTok’s algorithm pushes self-harm and eating disorder content to teenagers within minutes of them expressing interest in the topics on the app. The Center for Countering Digital Hate, which carried out the study via a series of “fake” accounts for 13-year-olds, said the results were “every parent’s nightmare”. TikTok said the study did not reflect the experience or viewing habits of real-life users of the app. A TikTok spokesperson said the company aimed to make the app “a place where people can share their true selves, raise awareness for important causes and find community”. Indeed, the EU-backed mental health report flags how TikTok can help people in recovery from eating disorders. The company also announced this month that teenagers joining TikTok would be limited to an hour of use each day, although the restriction can be altered or removed entirely in the app’s settings. TikTok is also far from the first social media app to be subject to concerns about mental health. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta was accused by the whisteblower Frances Haugen in 2021 of failing to address internal research showing the negative impact of its Instagram platform on teen mental health. That may be the paradox at the heart of TikTok. From its aggressive data collection, to fears it is harming the mental wellbeing of its young users, and even the central importance of the app on youth culture around the world, the app can sometimes feel as American as it comes. But in the only way that matters, it is not – and that could be an unsurmountable hurdle.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/31/tiktok-why-the-app-with-1bn-users-faces-a-fight-for-its-existence
21,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-30,‘Why am I crying over this?’: how corecore TikTok videos caught the mood of Gen Z,"Jimmy Nguyen, an 18-year-old student, saw his first “corecore” video on TikTok in January. He can’t remember which one it was – there are so many of them now. But he says it was typical of this new trend of video: other TikTok videos, celebrity or podcaster interviews, TV show and film clips spliced together over some sad or ambient music. They’re depressing, full of existential dread and usually on the theme of disconnection and alienation. Nguyen initially thought, like other users, that these videos were a joke. They’re crudely edited and the name in itself is a sarcastic reference to the proliferation of micro-trends emerging from TikTok since 2020. But he was soon staying up late at night in his bedroom making corecore of his own. “As I was making my first video I started to really see myself expressing how I was feeling and it felt relieving because I didn’t have anyone to talk to and explaining my emotions is hard,” he tells me. “But that video felt like an exit or gateway to those feelings.” In it, clips of Lee Jung-jae, the lead in Squid Game smiling broadly and falsely at the camera, someone recounting how in school kids would ask which super power you’d want out of invisibility and flying but he says “I’m already invisible” and Jake Gyllenhall in Stronger (2017) screaming “Why do you even want me? I’m such a fuck up!” run into each other over a morose Arcade Fire track. Now Nguyen makes these videos in an attempt to help people, he says, to let them know that they’re not alone. To date, the corecore hashtag on TikTok has 2.1bn views. Some young people consider this genre to be merely content or, worse still, content about content. But many feel it speaks to them and their experiences on a deep emotional level. “They’re my favourite type of TikTok video because they feel raw and real,” says 20-year-old Annabelle from London. “The combination of clips just somehow summarises everything that’s bad about life but I couldn’t quite tell you why.” Or as one commenter put it on a corecore video about struggling to date and the toxicity of modern relationships perpetuated by all genders: “why am i crying over this”. “This form of video started with ‘nichetok’ where you’d see really random clips spliced together, like footballers scoring goals, Peep Show clips and performances from Oasis and Blur. It was masculine and all the boys were making it,” says Eden Young, managing editor of Polyester zine and podcast co-host. “People wanted something a bit deeper and carved something more meaningful from this trend, which led to corecore.” It’s fairly obvious why Gen Z would enjoy corecore. You can be moved by these videos without knowing the sources of the clips but if you understand the pop, cultural and internet culture references, you feel special. Like most internet humour, if you get it, you get it. “Everything feels very hopeless and corecore speaks to these frustrations and anxieties. It’s a way to laugh at how hopeless everything is – or at least get some meaning from it. You have a lightbulb moment that says: oh yeah, the world is bullshit,” says Young. Are these videos art? A new frontier in amateur documentary making? “I can’t see why they wouldn’t be art if people are capable of reading things into the juxtapositions they’re presenting,” says art critic and author, Philippa Snow. “Whether they’re ‘good’ art or not is obviously debatable on a case-by-case basis, but that’s true of absolutely every artform on Earth.” She references a quote from a TikTok user called Dean Erfani, who said that corecore is essentially the abstract concept of taking random videos and editing them together to the point that it makes sense to the viewer. Or at least have the viewer interpret it in their own way. “That does not sound all that different to me from looking for meaning in ‘the chance encounter of a sewing machine and an umbrella on an operating table’ as the famous mantra of surrealism suggests.” In my favourite corecore video, almost euphorically bleak in its composition, Ampers Anthony edits together the following: a woman talks about her last boyfriend who had a no-crying rule, a hot man appears with the caption that he texted his ex to slow down her healing process, there’s commentary on “bad boys” and “good guys”, a guy laments that he can’t manipulate his current partner, women talk about not dating broke guys. The accompanying music (Darker Than This by composer Emile Mosseri) is bright, hopeful and against this noxious film feels faintly humorous, ironic. Its top comment reads: “This needs to be seen by everyone. Somehow this video captures it all. We are a loveless generation. You can’t pour from an empty cup.” To me, it, like the others of its kind, is a simple and accessible version of an Adam Curtis film, adopting his humour and slant, the seemingly unrelated clips with his voiceover. Young notes that the writer Mark Fisher’s ideas shine through in this genre: Fisher was anti-capitalism, spoke a lot about isolation and wondered how we can process the hopelessness in the modern world. When I watch corecore, as someone who only sporadically uses TikTok, it mimics the way using the app is an overstimulating act of binge-watching a stream of short videos and voices. This trend is a smart – and sad – comment on the proliferation of content in culture: self-focused, often narcissistic commentary, opinions, life-hacks and problem sharing – it’s everywhere. The videos make me feel despondent and sorry for a generation who grew up during the pandemic and have never in their lives logged off. Whether we enjoy them or not, they’re probably the avant garde documentaries we deserve and certainly the ones that make the most sense.",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/mar/30/corecore-tiktok-videos-gen-z
22,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-28,It’s the great TikTok panic – and it could accelerate the end of the internet as we know it | Emily Taylor,"TikTok’s chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, discovered during his five-hour grilling by US Congress what Huawei could have told him all along: being owned by a Chinese company is bad for business. In fact, the panic over TikTok is a lot like like Huawei and 5G all over again. The security and privacy risks are plausible, but largely without evidence. What this is really about is trust, trade and geopolitics. The US hearings took place as the UK extended its ban of TikTok to the parliamentary estate, after initially banning the app from central government officials’ work phones. Canada, the EU and several member states have implemented partial bans. Yet rather than taking this moment as an opportunity to revisit why democratic societies have allowed tech companies to make pervasive data collection and monitoring the norm, policymakers are rushing through bans that sit uncomfortably with the liberal democratic tradition, and are likely to accelerate the fragmentation of the internet. TikTok makes money by collecting data on its users and feeding them exactly what they’ve been profiled to respond to, including the goods and services of advertisers. That’s the business model of every free-to-use social media platform, and TikTok is particularly good at it. Nearly 70% of American teenagers use the app, while only 30% of the same age group use Facebook. By some estimates, young people open the app up to 19 times a day. The company’s 5,000-word privacy policy sets out in grim detail just how much data is collected: essentially, it’s everything. The terms are also clear about the use of that data to personalise and customise your feed, fulfil purchases, personalise ads and measure their effectiveness. But the business model that TikTok shares with its US rivals does not seem to bother policymakers that much. Their anxieties are about whom that data is shared with. TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, is Chinese – and the security concerns are real. There is China’s weak rule of law, human rights concerns regarding the oppression of Uighur Muslims, and the use of technology to enforce social and political conformity to think about. There are also worries about its national security laws, which compel companies to share data with the government. Put together all the data, including device, location, IP address, content viewed, duration and frequency of use, engagement with other users and an authoritarian state, and you have a combustible mix. We also can’t forget the lessons learned from the 2016 US presidential elections and the Brexit referendum onward, which indicate that hostile actors can and do manipulate algorithms designed for advertising, and subvert them for political ends. With TikTok, where the user population is young and vulnerable to exploitation and manipulation (whether towards terrorism, political radicalisation or harmful body-image anxiety), those risks are acute. As the bans mount up, TikTok has been rushing to implement confidence-building measures. The detail of its initiatives, Project Clover in the EU and Project Texas in the US, seems compelling. User data will be kept onshore in the EU or US, data practices will be vetted by trusted third parties – such as Oracle in the US – and there will be a default 60-minute screen time limit for young people. But, as with Huawei, this is not going to be enough because this was never about the details. As was clear from Congress’s aggressive questioning of TikTok’s CEO, in which he was often interrupted and talked over, US policymakers don’t think they need more information. They want to communicate their distrust of China in the context of worsening geopolitical and economic tensions. This is bad news for the internet. In its early years, shared physical infrastructure and lightweight interoperable digital architecture were felt to be a shared public good. Everyone, no matter what their political differences, had an interest in getting online. Today, the tendrils of geopolitics extend into the deepest layers of the technical architecture, from undersea cables to semiconductors, to emerging technical standards. China, and Chinese companies including Huawei, have even put forward proposals at technical standards bodies that would fundamentally change the architecture of the internet, fragmenting its common structure. This might not be surprising given China’s attitude towards the free flow of data; what is more concerning is seeing advanced democracies – which were supposed to fly the flag for a single, global internet – contribute to the same fragmentary tendency. A ban on TikTok would be a relief for some of its US rivals, providing them with a precious window in which to up their game with younger generations. But it’s the constitutional impact of a ban that should be troubling in the land of the first amendment. As TikTok’s popularity among young people only grows, the high politics of the current debate marginalises the genuine concerns – about addiction, the impact on mental health and body image – of that most vulnerable segment of our societies. Advanced democracies have an opportunity to have a grown-up debate on how to hold a global internet together while respecting political differences, protecting free expression and supporting the most vulnerable. Instead, the incredible benefits of our shared digital architecture are being washed away in thoughtless, kneejerk responses to the economic and political rise of China.

23,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-28,Norwegian company says TikTok data centre is limiting energy for manufacturing Ukraine ammunition,"One of Europe’s largest ammunition manufacturers has said efforts to meet surging demand from the war in Ukraine have been stymied by a new TikTok data centre that is monopolising electricity in the region close to its biggest factory. The chief executive of Nammo, which is co-owned by the Norwegian government, said a planned expansion of its largest factory in central Norway hit a roadblock due to a lack of surplus energy, with the construction of TikTok’s new data centre using up electricity in the local area. “We are concerned because we see our future growth is challenged by the storage of cat videos,” Morten Brandtzæg told the Financial Times. Demand for artillery rounds is 15 times higher than normal and Europe’s munitions industry needs to invest €2bn in new factories to keep up with Ukraine’s needs, according to Brandtzæg. By some estimates, Ukraine is firing 6,000 to 7,000 artillery shells a day and is facing ammunition shortages after more than a year of war. European Union leaders have announced a program to reimburse countries offering artillery ammunition to Ukraine from a €1bn fund, while spending an additional €1bn on increasing ammunitions manufacturing capacity across the bloc. But plans by Nammo to expand its largest manufacturing facility appear to have come up against TikTok’s efforts to improve its image in the face of a growing number of bans across the world by housing the data of Europeans more locally. TikTok is fighting a proposed national ban in the US, where it has already been banned on most government devices. The UK government, European Commission and the European parliament also recently banned TikTok from staff phones due to concerns that user data belonging to the company – which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance – could be harvested by China’s government. TikTok said last year that some employees in China could access European user data and admitted that employees had used its own app to spy on journalists in an effort to track down leaks. In a congressional hearing last week however, the company’s CEO insisted that TikTok was entirely independent from the Chinese government and that Chinese authorities had no access to its data. However, in an effort to placate European lawmakers, TikTok said it would begin storing European user data locally this year, with migration continuing into 2024. The company said it would reduce the transfer of data outside the region, and reduce employee access to user data internally. The company announced plans to open new data centres in Ireland and in the Hamar region of Norway. Elvia, the local energy provider, confirmed to the Financial Times that the electricity network had no spare capacity after allocating it to the data centre on a first-come, first-served basis. Additional capacity would take time to become available. TikTok has been contacted for comment. International tech and social media companies are facing increased scrutiny over their operation of the huge centres used to store vast quantities of data. These centres consume large amounts of energy to power and cool the servers that store customers’ pictures, videos and other cloud-based data. By 2030, the European Commission estimates that data centres will account for 3.2% of electricity demand within the bloc, an 18.5% jump from 2018. A draft plan to force data centres to publish their environmental impact was obtained by Politico last year. Authorities “should not be put in the position of having to choose between attracting … data centres on the one hand and ensuring that businesses and households can access electricity on the other hand,” the plan said.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/28/energy-hungry-tiktok-data-centre-ukraine-ammunition-production-nammo-norway
24,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-27,US moves forward plan to ban TikTok as AOC joins protests supporting app,"Lawmakers have said they’re moving forward with plans for a national ban on TikTok, as users including Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez take to the app to protest. The snowballing effort to take action against TikTok comes after company chief Shou Zi Chew appeared before a US House committee for five hours on Thursday, where lawmakers from both parties grilled him about national security and other concerns involving the app. Following the hearing, Ocasio-Cortez made her first ever TikTok to speak out against a potential ban – highlighting the unprecedented nature of such an action. Meanwhile, thousands of video edits flooded the app making fun of moments in the hearing. Young users have skewered politicians as out of touch for questions about TikTok’s technology. “This is the most boomer thing I have ever seen,” one caption reads on a video of a member of Congress accusing TikTok of tracking users’ pupil dilation. The grassroots social media effort highlights a tension between the app’s growing popularity and lawmakers’ push to ban it. TikTok now has more than 150 million users in the US. Despite the protests, authorities appear set on pushing ahead with restricting the platform. On Sunday, Kevin McCarthy, the US House of Representatives speaker, said lawmakers will move forward with legislation to address national security concerns about TikTok, alleging China’s government has had access to the app’s user data. In the United States, there are growing calls to ban TikTok, owned by China-based company ByteDance, or to pass bipartisan legislation to give Joe Biden’s administration legal authority to seek a ban. Devices owned by the US government were recently banned from having the app installed. “The House will be moving forward with legislation to protect Americans from the technological tentacles of the Chinese Communist Party,” McCarthy said on Twitter. In Thursday’s hearing, the TikTok CEO was asked if of the app has spied on Americans at Beijing’s request. “No,” Chew said. Outside of the hearing, a group of more than 30 content creators protested the potential ban, holding signs that said “Keep TikTok.” Republican congressman Neal Dunn referenced the company’s disclosure in December that some China-based employees at ByteDance improperly accessed TikTok user data of two journalists and were no longer employed by the company. He repeated his question about whether ByteDance was spying. “I don’t think that spying is the right way to describe it,” Chew said. He went on to describe the reports as involving an “internal investigation” before being cut off. Speaker McCarthy, a Republican, said in a tweet on Sunday, “It’s very concerning that the CEO of TikTok can’t be honest and admit what we already know to be true – China has access to TikTok user data.” The company says it has spent more than $1.5bn on data security efforts under a planned dubbed “Project Texas”, which aims to alleviate lawmakers’ concerns by relocating all US user data to centers outside of China, through a partnership with the Texas-based firm Oracle. But rather than appease lawmakers’ concerns, Chew’s appearance before Congress on Thursday “actually increased the likelihood that Congress will take some action”, Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, the Republican chair of the House select committee on the Chinese Communist party, told ABC News on Sunday.

25,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-26,"Yes, it’s crazy to have TikTok on official phones. But it’s not good for any of us | John Naughton","As of this moment, government officials in 11 countries are forbidden to run TikTok on their government-issued phones. The countries include the US, Canada, Denmark, Belgium, the UK, New Zealand, Norway, France, the Netherlands and Poland. In addition, European Commission and European parliament staff were required to delete the app. This raises two questions. First, why were politicians and senior officials in democracies scrolling like zombies through dance crazes, daft pet videos, feeling “bonita” and things you can do with smudged lipstick? And second, what took these governments so long? After all, it’s never been a secret that TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese tech giant based in Beijing. Nor is it a secret that in the People’s Republic of China all corporations bend to Xi Jinping’s will. So anything that TikTok gets to know about its users can, ultimately, also be known by the Chinese regime, right down to Matt Hancock’s dance routines. Even Donald Trump understood that, which is why he launched a half-arsed attempt to “order” ByteDance to sell TikTok to a US company within 90 days. Like most Trump initiatives, this one was dead on arrival. But the political impetus to “do something” about TikTok has reached fever pitch under the Biden administration and last week led to TikTok’s CEO, Shou Zi Chew, being dragged before Congress to persuade legislators that, while ByteDance may own TikTok, it doesn’t call the shots. It was a hard sell and Chew didn’t close the deal. His line was that TikTok had a plan – “Project Texas” – to store US users’ data in Texas. Given that it is hard to think of an American data repository that has not been penetrated by Chinese hackers, this reassured no one. More importantly, though, when an official Chinese spokesman said, during the hearing, that his government would “firmly oppose” any forced sale of TikTok, it was clear that Chew was the monkey, not the organ-grinder, in this story. So we can expect political pressure to ban TikTok to increase until the associated rhetoric runs up against demographic and, possibly, electoral realities. It’s one thing to stop government officials from zombie scrolling, but more than 500 million Gen Z and Gen Y kids are addicted to the app and are likely to be infuriated if deprived of their online fixes by boomers whose economic policies have screwed their hopes of ever owning a home. And – who knows? – one day those disaffected cohorts might even go to polling stations and vote. Similar considerations might give pause to legislators in other polities who are contemplating a general ban on TikTok. But, for the US at least, the app is a sideshow in a much bigger game. The country’s rulers are in the grip of hegemonic panic – increasingly rattled by the emergence of China as a rival superpower that is determined to reshape the US-dominated, postwar global order. And they are determined to prevent that happening. A key element in US strategy is to deny China mastery of digital technology. The legislative tool for achieving that goal is “the Restrict (Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology) act”, a bill that is on its way through Congress. The bill goes well beyond banning TikTok or sanctioning Huawei. It empowers the president and executive branch (specifically, the US Department of Commerce) to act swiftly with legal empowerment from Congress, which avoids the fiasco of Trump’s previous attempt to ban TikTok and WeChat. The aims of the bill are astonishingly broad: “To authorize the Secretary of Commerce to review and prohibit certain transactions between persons in the United States and foreign adversaries, and for other purposes.” The list of technologies includes nearly everything that one might list under the general heading of “digital”. Unusually in the current fractured politics of the US, the bill has strong bipartisan support and the White House is backing it. So it’s likely to become law fairly soon. If it does, says Kevin Xu, a shrewd observer of these things, it’s “game over” for all Chinese technology companies seeking to do business in the US. All of which rather puts TikTok in context. But, as it happens, there are good public health grounds for banning the app – notably its pathologically addictive properties and its ultra-detailed surveillance of its users. If in doubt, just watch your teenage kids when they’re on it: it’s basically Instagram on steroids. But if we were to ban TikTok, shouldn’t we then also ban all social media apps that rely on algorithmic curation for their revenues? Now there’s a really interesting idea. • John Naughton chairs the advisory board of the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

26,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-24,TikTok CEO questioned on China concerns at landmark hearing | First Thing,"Good morning. The chief executive of TikTok, Shou Zi Chew, was forced to defend his company’s relationship with China, as well as the protections for its youngest users, at a testy congressional hearing on Thursday that came amid a bipartisan push to ban the app entirely in the US over national security concerns. The hearing marked the first appearance before US lawmakers by a TikTok chief executive, and a rare public outing for the 40-year-old Chew, who has remained largely out of the limelight as the social network’s popularity soars. TikTok boasts tens of millions of US users, but lawmakers have long held concerns over China’s control over the app, which Chew repeatedly tried to assuage throughout the hearing. “Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,” Chew said in his testimony. Questioning got off to a forceful start with members of the committee hammering Chew on his connection to executives at TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, who lawmakers say have ties to the Chinese Communist party. The committee members asked how frequently Chew was in contact with them, and questioned whether the company’s proposed solutions to US data security concerns would offer sufficient protection against Chinese laws that require companies to make user data accessible to the government. What are the key takeaways from TikTok hearing in Congress? Chew defended TikTok’s privacy practices, stating they are are in line with those of other social media platforms, adding that in many cases the app collects less data than its peers. “There are more than 150 million Americans who love our platform, and we know we have a responsibility to protect them,” Chew said. Here are some of the other key criticisms Chew faced at yesterday’s landmark hearing, and what could lie ahead. US strikes Iran-backed group in Syria after deadly attack on coalition base The US has carried out airstrikes on an Iran-backed group in Syria, after an American contractor was killed when a suspected Iranian-made drone attacked a coalition base in the country’s north-east. Five US service members and one other US contractor were wounded in the attack on Thursday, the Pentagon said. In a statement released later on Thursday, the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said US Central Command forces retaliated against the attack with “precision airstrikes” against facilities in eastern Syria used by groups affiliated with Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. Did the strikes kill anyone? Yes. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported: “US strikes targeted a weapons depots inside Deir ez-Zor city, killing six pro-Iran fighters, and two other fighters were killed by strikes targeting the desert of Mayadine and near al-Boukamal.” ‘Like a war zone’: Congress hears of China’s abuses in Xinjiang ‘re-education camps’ Two women who say they experienced and escaped Chinese “re-education camps” have provided first-hand testimony to members of the US Congress, giving harrowing detail while imploring Americans not to look away from what the US has declared a continuing genocide of Muslim ethnic minorities. Testifying before a special House committee at the beginning of Ramadan, Gulbahar Haitiwaji, a Uyghur woman, said that during her nearly three years in internment camps and police stations, prisoners were subjected to 11 hours of “brainwashing education” each day. It included singing patriotic songs and praising the Chinese government before and after meals. Haitiwaji said detainees were punished for speaking in Uyghur and endured routine interrogations during which they were hooded and shackled to their chairs. On one occasion, she said, she was chained to her bed for 20 days. Female prisoners were told they would be vaccinated, when they were being sterilized. “There are cameras all over the camp,” Haitiwaji said. “Our every move was monitored.” What did the other woman say? Qelbinur Sidik, a member of China’s ethnic Uzbek minority who is now a human rights activist living in the Netherlands, told of being coerced by Chinese authorities into teaching classes at one of China’s internment camps. Through a translator, she described the detention facilities as “like a war zone” with razor wire fencing and armed guards. Sidik recalled hearing the “horrible screaming sounds” of Uyghur prisoners as they were tortured. In other news … The governor of Utah, Spencer Cox, has signed sweeping legislation requiring explicit parental permissions for anyone under 18 to use platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. He also signed a bill prohibiting social media companies from employing techniques that could cause minors to develop an “addiction” to the platforms. The families of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira have voiced frustration and anger after the preliminary court hearings of three of their alleged murderers had to be suspended in Brazil because of poor internet and logistical problems at the high-security prisons where the defendants are being held. The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, accused Republicans in the US Congress of interfering in his investigation of Donald Trump over a hush money payment to the adult film star Stormy Daniels. Bragg published his letter as it became clear another day would pass without an indictment of Trump.

Stat of the day: Majority of trans adults are happier after transitioning, survey finds A large majority of transgender adults say that transitioning has made them more satisfied with their life, according to a survey. The survey, conducted by the Washington Post and KFF, is the largest nongovernmental survey of transgender adults that uses random samplings. The questionnaire found that a majority of transgender adults are happier after transitioning, with 78% of respondents noting that living as a gender outside the one assigned at birth has increased their satisfaction in life, reported the Washington Post. More than four out of 10 adults noted that they are “a lot more” satisfied. While overall rates of life satisfaction among trans adults were lower than the general population, many survey participants said that was largely due to discrimination facing trans people. Don’t miss this: Ethical no man’s land – can the US supreme court be trusted to police itself? The nation’s highest court relies on justices to judge for themselves if they have a conflict of interest. Often members of the hard-right majority decide they don’t. Last July, Samuel Alito, one of the nine justices of the US supreme court, delivered the keynote speech at a gala dinner held at the Palazzo Colonna in Rome. The justice had been flown out to Rome by the Religious Liberty Initiative, an outpost of the University of Notre Dame law school that advocates for religious freedom informed by the Catholic tradition. This was not the group’s first contact with Alito. The initiative and its faculty have filed amicus briefs with the supreme court in at least six high-profile cases since it was founded in 2020. Two of the group’s fellows filed amicus briefs arguing against the constitutional right to an abortion in Dobbs, the case that led to the court overturning Roe v Wade in a contentious ruling written by Alito. … or this: ‘These are my stomping grounds’ – the first Black-owned bookstore opens in Octavia Butler’s home town Books are strewn everywhere and are awaiting their turn to be shuffled into their assigned nooks in tall black shelves, writes Jireh Deng.

Her store, Octavia’s Bookshelf, Pasadena’s first and only Black-owned bookstore, was inspired by the speculative-fiction writer Octavia E Butler, who spent her life and career in the city.

Climate check: Cargo ships powered by wind could help tackle climate crisis Cars, trucks and planes get plenty of blame for helping drive the climate crisis, but shipping produces a large portion of the world’s greenhouse gases, as well as nitrogen oxides and sulphur pollution because ships largely use cheap heavy fuel oil. It’s been a struggle to clean up the shipping industry but one solution is to use wind-powered ships. That may seem like going back to the days of the Cutty Sark, but new hi-tech wind-propulsion can be fitted to existing ships to cut fuel use, supplying between 10% and 90% of a ship’s power needs, depending on where on the ocean they are and which weather patterns they harness. Wind is free, blows harder at sea than on land and weather-routing software uses sophisticated algorithms to plot the fastest and most fuel-efficient voyage. Last Thing: Harvard physicist plans Pacific expedition to find first interstellar meteor A prominent Harvard physicist is planning a Pacific expedition to find what he thinks might be an alien artifact that smashed into the ocean. Avi Loeb announced that he is organizing a $1.5m ocean expedition to Papua New Guinea to look for fragments of an object that crashed off the coast of its Manus Island in 2014. Loeb noticed the object in 2019 and identified it as the first interstellar meteor ever discovered – meaning it originated outside our solar system. According to Loeb, the meteor’s interstellar origin was confirmed to Nasa in April 2022 by the Department of Defense’s space command. Loeb and his team also concluded that the meteor was tougher than all other 272 meteors in Nasa’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies catalog.

27,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-23,"TikTok CEO grilled for over five hours on China, drugs and teen mental health","The chief executive of TikTok, Shou Zi Chew, was forced to defend his company’s relationship with China, as well as the protections for its youngest users, at a testy congressional hearing on Thursday that came amid a bipartisan push to ban the app entirely in the US over national security concerns. The hearing marked the first ever appearance before US lawmakers by a TikTok chief executive, and a rare public outing for the 4o-year-old Chew, who has remained largely out of the limelight as the social network’s popularity soars.

The committee members asked how frequently Chew was in contact with them, and questioned whether the company’s proposed solutions to US data security concerns would offer sufficient protection against Chinese laws that require companies to make user data accessible to the government. Chew’s claims of independence from the Chinese government were undermined by a Wall Street Journal story published just hours before the hearing that said China would strongly oppose any forced sale of the company. Responding for the first time to Joe Biden’s threat of a national ban unless ByteDance sells its shares, the Chinese commerce ministry said such a move would involve exporting technology from China and thus would have to be approved by the Chinese government. Lawmakers also questioned Chew, a former Goldman Sachs banker who has helmed the company since March 2021, over the platform’s impact on mental health, particularly of its young users. The Republican congressman Gus Bilirakis shared the story of Chase Nasca, a 16-year-old boy who killed himself a year ago by stepping in front of a train. Nasca’s parents, who have sued ByteDance, claiming Chase was “targeted” with unsolicited self-harm content, appeared at the hearing and grew emotional as Bilirakis told their son’s story. “I want to thank his parents for being here today, and allowing us to show this,” Bilirakis said. “Mr Chew, your company destroyed their lives.” Driving home concerns about young users, congresswoman Nanette Barragán asked Chew about reports that he does not let his own children use the app. “At what age do you think it would be appropriate for a young person to get on TikTok?” she said. Chew confirmed his own children were not on TikTok but said that was because in Singapore, where they live, there is not a version of the platform for users under the age of 13. Chew, who has kept a relatively low-profile during his two years as CEO, spent much of the five-hour hearing stressing TikTok’s distance from the Chinese government, kicking off his testimony with an emphasis on his own Singaporean heritage. Chew talked about Project Texas – an effort to move all US data to domestic servers – and said the company was deleting all US user data that is backed up to servers outside of the country by the end of the year. Some legislators expressed skepticism that Project Texas was too large an undertaking and would not tackle concerns about US data privacy soon enough. “I am concerned that what you’re proposing with Project Texas just doesn’t have the technical capability of providing us the assurances that we need,” the California Republican Jay Obernolte, a software engineer, said. At one point, Tony Cárdenas, a Democrat from California, asked Chew outright if TikTok is a Chinese company. Chew responded that TikTok is global in nature, not available in mainland China, and headquartered in Singapore and Los Angeles. Neal Dunn, a Republican from Florida, asked with similar bluntness whether ByteDance has “spied on American citizens” – a question that came amid reports the company had accessed journalists’ information in an attempt to identify which employees leaked information. Chew responded that “spying is not the right way to describe it”. The hearing comes three years after TikTok was formally targeted by the Trump administration with an executive order prohibiting US companies from doing business with ByteDance. Biden revoked that order in June 2021, under the stipulation that the US committee on foreign investment conduct a review of the company. When that review stalled, Biden demanded TikTok sell its Chinese-owned shares or face a ban in the US. This bipartisan nature of the backlash was remarked upon several times during the hearing, with Cárdenas pointing out that Chew “has been one of the few people to unite this committee”. Chew’s testimony, some lawmakers said, was reminiscent of Mark Zuckerberg’s appearance in an April 2018 hearing to answer for his own platform’s data-privacy issues – answers many lawmakers were unsatisfied with. Cárdenas said: “We are frustrated with TikTok … and yes, you keep mentioning that there are industry issues that not only TikTok faces but others. You remind me a lot of [Mark] Zuckerberg ... when he came here, I said he reminds me of Fred Astaire: a good dancer with words. And you are doing the same today. A lot of your answers are a bit nebulous, they’re not yes or no.” Chew warned users in a video posted to TikTok earlier in the week that the company was at a “pivotal moment”. “Some politicians have started talking about banning TikTok,” he said, adding that the app now has more than 150 million active monthly US users. “That’s almost half the US coming to TikTok.” TikTok has battled legislative headwinds since its meteoric rise began in 2018. Today, a majority of teens in the US say they use TikTok – with 67% of people ages 13 to 17 saying they have used the app and 16% of that age group saying they use it “almost constantly”, according to the Pew Research Center. This has raised a number of concerns about the app’s impact on young users’ safety, with self-harm and eating disorder-related content spreading on the platform. TikTok is also facing lawsuits over deadly “challenges” that have gone viral on the app. TikTok has introduced features in response to such criticisms, including automatic time limits for users under 18. Some tech critics have said that while TikTok’s data collection does raise concerns, its practices are not much different from those of other big tech firms. “Holding TikTok and China accountable are steps in the right direction, but doing so without holding other platforms accountable is simply not enough,” said the Tech Oversight Project, a technology policy advocacy organization, in a statement. “Lawmakers and regulators should use this week’s hearing as an opportunity to re-engage with civil society organizations, NGOs, academics and activists to squash all of big tech’s harmful practices.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/23/tiktok-shou-zi-chew-congress

Chew’s appearance comes at a pivotal time for TikTok, which is facing bipartisan fire after experiencing a meteoric rise in popularity in recent years. The company is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, raising concerns about China’s influence over the app – criticisms Chew repeatedly tried to resist throughout the hearing. “Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,” he said in prepared testimony.

Concerns about the viability of ‘Project Texas’ In an effort to deflect concerns about Chinese influence, TikTok has pledged to relocate all US user data to domestic servers through an effort titled Project Texas, a plan that would also allow US tech firm Oracle to scrutinize TikTok’s source code and act as a third-party monitor. The company has promised to complete the effort by the end of the year, but some lawmakers questioned whether that is possible, with hundreds of millions of lines of source code requiring review in a relatively short amount of time. “I am concerned that what you’re proposing with Project Texas just doesn’t have the technical capability of providing us the assurances that we need,” the California Republican Jay Obernolte, a congressman and software engineer, said. Youth safety and mental health in the spotlight Another frequent focus was the safety of TikTok’s young users, considering the app has exploded in popularity with this age group in recent years. A majority of teens in the US say they use TikTok – with 67% of people aged 13 to 17 saying they have used the app and 16% of that age group saying they use it “almost constantly”, according to the Pew Research Center. Lawmakers cited reports that drug-related content has spread on the app, allowing teens to purchase dangerous substances easily online. Chew said such content violates TikTok policy and that they are removed when identified. “We take this very seriously,” Chew said. “This is an industry-wide challenge, and we’re investing as much as we can. We don’t think it represents the majority of the users’ experience on TikTok, but it does happen.” Others cited self-harm and eating disorder content, which have been spreading on the platform. TikTok is also facing lawsuits over deadly “challenges” that have gone viral on the app. Mental health concerns were underscored at the hearing by the appearance of Dean and Michelle Nasca, the parents of a teen who died by suicide after allegedly being served unsolicited self-harm content on TikTok. “We need you to do your part,” said congresswoman Kim Schrier, who is a pediatrician. “It could save this generation.” Uncertainty lingers over a possible ban The federal government has already barred TikTok on government devices, and the Biden administration has threatened a national ban. Thursday’s hearing left the future of the app in the US uncertain, as members of the committee appeared unwavering in their conviction that TikTok was a tool that could be exploited by the Chinese Communist party. Their conviction was bolstered by a report in the Wall Street Journal, released just hours before the hearing, indicating the Chinese government would not approve a sale of TikTok. Lawmakers outside of the committee are also unconvinced. US senators Mark Warner and John Thune said in a statement that all Chinese companies “are ultimately required to do the bidding of Chinese intelligence services, should they be called upon to do so” and that nothing Chew said in his testimony assuaged those concerns. Colorado senator Michael Bennet also reiterated calls for an all-out ban of TikTok. But the idea of a national ban still faces huge hurdles, both legally and in the court of public opinion. For one, previous attempts to ban TikTok under the Trump administration was blocked in court due in part to free speech concerns. TikTok also remains one of the fastest growing and most popular apps in the US and millions of its users are unlikely to want to give it up. A coalition of civil liberties, privacy and security groups including Fight for the Future, the Center for Democracy and Technology, and the American Civil Liberties Union have written a letter opposing a ban, arguing that it would violate constitutional rights to freedom of expression. “A nationwide ban on TikTok would have serious ramifications for free expression in the digital sphere, infringing on Americans’ first amendment rights and setting a potent and worrying precedent in a time of increased censorship of internet users around the world,” the letter reads. Where the coalition and many members of the House committee agree is on the pressing need for federal data privacy regulation that protects consumer information and reins in all big tech platforms, including TikTok. The American Data Privacy Act – a bipartisan bill working its way through Washington – is one effort under way to address those concerns.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/23/key-takeaways-tiktok-hearing-congress-shou-zi-chew
29,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-23,TikTok hearing: CEO Shou Zi Chew testifies before US Congress amid looming ban – as it happened,"With that, the blog is closed for today. Please see our full summary of the hearing here, and thanks for reading! What’s next for TikTok? It’s hard to know where we go from here. Members of the committee appeared unwavering in their conviction that TikTok was a tool that could be exploited by the CCP – a conviction that was ultimately bolstered by today’s WSJ report indicating the Chinese government would not approve a sale of TikTok. Lawmakers outside of the committee are also unconvinced. US Senators Mark R Warner and John Thune said in a statement that all Chinese companies “are ultimately required to do the bidding of Chinese intelligence services, should they be called upon to do so” and that nothing Chew said in his testimony assuaged those concerns. Colorado Senator Michael Bennet reiterated calls for an all out ban of TikTok, saying that Chew’s testimony is a departure from what Chew told Bennet in a private meeting weeks prior to the hearing. “When he was in my office, the CEO admitted to me that my interpretation of Chinese law was correct, which was that any time the CPP wanted to say: we’re going to have the data turned over, that ByteDance, and therefore TikTok, had a legal obligation to turn that data over. Now he’s saying something different in his testimony to the committee.” But a coalition of civil liberties, privacy and security groups including Fight for the Future, the Center for Democracy and Technology and the American Civil Liberties Union have written a letter opposing a ban, arguing that it would violate constitutional rights to freedom of expression. “If passed by Congress and enacted into law, a nationwide ban on TikTok would have serious ramifications for free expression in the digital sphere, infringing on Americans’ First Amendment rights and setting a potent and worrying precedent in a time of increased censorship of internet users around the world,” the letter reads. Where the coalition and many members of the House committee agree is that there is a pressing need for a federal data privacy regulation that protects consumer information. Multiple members of the House committee on energy and commerce mentioned a proposed federal bipartisan privacy bill, the American Data Privacy Act, and the need for such a regulation to rein in TikTok. The coalition agrees: federal regulations could address the data-privacy issues the entire tech industry shares with TikTok. “A comprehensive consumer privacy bill would limit data commodification, thereby dramatically increasing users’ security online. A robust privacy bill could address concerns not just at TikTok but across the multiple social media platforms,” the letter continues. That’s a wrap: key takeaways from today’s hearing The first appearance in Congress for TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew stretched more than five hours, with contentious questioning targeting the app’s relationship with China and protections for its youngest users. Here are some key themes focused on today. TikTok’s relationship to China Many members of the committee focused in on TikTok’s parent company ByteDance and executives there who lawmakers say have ties to the Chinese Communist party. The committee members asked how frequently Chew was in contact with them, and questioned whether the company’s proposed solution, called Project Texas, would offer sufficient protection against Chinese laws that require companies to make user data accessible to the government. At one point, Tony Cárdenas, a Democrat from California, asked Chew outright if TikTok is a Chinese company. Chew responded that TikTok is global in nature, not available in mainland China, and headquartered in Singapore and Los Angeles. Neal Dunn, a Republican from Florida, asked with similar bluntness whether ByteDance has “spied on American citizens” – a question that came amid reports the company accessed journalists’ information in an attempt to identify which employees were leaking information. Chew responded that “spying is not the right way to describe it”. Project Texas and user data In an effort to deflect concerns about Chinese influence, TikTok has pledged to relocate all US user data to servers outside of China through an effort titled Project Texas. The company has promised to complete the effort by the end of the year, but some lawmakers questioned whether that is possible, with hundreds of millions of lines of source code requiring review in a relatively short amount of time. “I am concerned that what you’re proposing with Project Texas just doesn’t have the technical capability of providing us the assurances that we need,” the California Republican Jay Obernolte, a software engineer, said. Youth safety on TikTok Another frequent focus of today’s hearing was safety of TikTok’s young users, as the app has exploded in popularity with the age group in recent years. Today, a majority of teens in the US say they use TikTok – with 67% of people ages 13 to 17 saying they have used the app and 16% of that age group saying they use it “almost constantly”, according to the Pew Research Center. Lawmakers cited reports that drug-related content has spread on the app, allowing teens to purchase dangerous substances easily online. Chew said such content violates TikTok policy and that they are removed when identified. “We take this very seriously,” Chew said. “This is an industry-wide challenge, and we’re investing as much as we can. We don’t think it represents the majority of the users’ experience on TikTok, but it does happen.” Others cited self-harm, and eating disorder content have been spreading on the platform. TikTok is also facing lawsuits over deadly “challenges” that have gone viral on the app. “We need you to do your part,” said congresswoman Kim Schrier, who is a pediatrician. “It could save this generation.” Today’s hearing stretched over five hours and included some tense exchanges on everything from TikTok’s relationship to China to the safeguarding of young users. Here are some of the most striking images: And with that, the hearing has come to a close. Stay tuned for some key takeaways from the congressional grilling of TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew that lasted over five hours. Here’s video of a key moment from earlier in the hearing. Republican Kat Cammack showed Congress a TikTok video inciting violence towards the House energy and commerce committee, with the chair of the committee named in the captions. The video was uploaded to the platform 41 days ago and was still circulating despite company guidelines assuring users it would take down threatening content. Shou Zi Chew was denied a chance to respond to Cammack’s claims by the chair. The video was removed from TikTok during the hearing. Several Congress members took the opportunity on Thursday to question Chew about drug concerns on TikTok. Angie Craig of Minnesota referenced a Washington Post report from earlier this month that showed drugs are easily accessible on the platform. “What are you going to do to move past these token efforts to prevent teenagers from accessing drugs on your platform?” she asked. In the past TikTok has directed users who search certain drug-related hashtags, like “fentanyl” to resource pages. Craig suggested that users seeking drugs would likely not use hashtags, and that dealers are able to bypass such measures using different hashtag spellings and emojis. “We do take illegal illegal drugs content on our platform very seriously – it violates our guidelines,” Chew said. He added that the company is working to more proactively find drug-related content. Rick Allen also questioned Chew about drug-related content on TikTok, noting a 2021 investigation from the Wall Street Journal that revealed the app served an account purporting to be 13 years old more than 500 videos about drug use. Chew said such content violates TikTok policy and that they are removed when identified. “We take this very seriously,” he said. “This is an industry-wide challenge, and we’re investing as much as we can. We don’t think it represents the majority of the users’ experience on TikTok, but it does happen.” Upon return from break, Congress questioning continued to take a harsh tone, hours into a grilling of Chew. Texas representative Randy Weber was aggressive with his time on the floor, accusing TikTok of “indoctrinating” American kids with “divisive, woke, and pro-CCP content”. “If this committee gets its way, TikTok’s time is up,” he said. Shortly after, Morgan Griffith of Virginia accused TikTok of being an agent of the Chinese Communist party as well. “Is it part of the Chinese Communist party as everybody thinks, or are you still living in some mystical world?” he asked. We are back in session, with testy questioning from Congress continuing. Stay tuned for more. The hearing has entered recess and will reconvene in a bit. Stand by for updates. Congresswoman Kim Schrier, who is a pediatrician, asked Chew a number of questions about TikTok’s impact on young users’ health. The issue has been a central concern in today’s hearing, which is titled TikTok: How Congress Can Safeguard American Data Privacy and Protect Children from Online Harms. Schrier said TikTok has been particularly dangerous for children during the pandemic, when social media was already replacing in-person interactions. “Social media is designed to be addicting, and your platform is the most addictive of all,” she said. “And this endless, mindless scrolling takes teams away from human relationships.” She added that TikTok is keeping teens awake “well past their bedtimes” at a time when “sleep is critical for brain and physical development”. She also noted that there is a large amount of harmful content on the app encouraging eating disorders. Chew said TikTok has worked with experts to tackle such content and is building models to identify and remove it more quickly. “Anything that glorifies eating disorders we remove,” he said. “It’s something we take very seriously.” Previous Guardian reporting showed that hashtags promoting eating disorders frequently evaded bans on TikTok. Teens attempting to recover from disordered eating described being trapped in algorithmic bubbles that fed them dangerous content. Schrier encouraged Chew to expedite responses to these concerns. “We need you to do your part,” she said. “It could save this generation.” Republican representative Neal Dunn of Florida outright asked: “Has ByteDance spied on American citizens?” The question comes after reports emerged in 2022 that the company accessed location data of reporters in an attempt to identify which employees were leaking information. Chew responded that “spying is not the right way to describe it”. Driving home concerns about young users on TikTok, Congresswoman Nanette Barragán asked Chew about reports that he does not let his own children use the app. “At what age do you think it would be appropriate for a young person to get on TikTok?” she said. Chew said his children are not on TikTok because in Singapore, where they live, there is not a version of the platform for users under the age of 13. In the US there is a version of “TikTok for Younger Users” in which the content is curated for a younger audience. “Our approach is to give differentiated experiences for different age groups and let the parents have conversations with their children to decide what’s best for their family,” he said. California Republican Jay Obernolte, who is a software engineer, asked a series of technical questions of Chew relating to how TikTok plans to manage US user data in the future. The questions related to Project Texas – an effort TikTok is carrying out to relocate all US user data to domestic servers. As part of the project, US tech firm Oracle is going through lines of TikTok source code – a massive undertaking. “I am concerned that what you’re proposing with Project Texas just doesn’t have the technical capability of providing us the assurances that we need,” Obernolte said. Obernolte said that concerns raised by TikTok are not unique to the Chinese company and called for better protections for Americans. “Social media companies gather a tremendous amount of user data and then use powerful AI tools to use that data to make really accurate predictions of human behavior, and then seek to manipulate that behavior,” he said. “That’s not just TikTok – it’s all social media companies that are doing this. Ultimately, the solution is to enact comprehensive federal data privacy legislation that will prevent that kind of behavior, or at least allow users to consent to it.” US representative Tony Cárdenas, a Democrat from California, asked the CEO outright if TikTok is a Chinese company. Chew said TikTok is global in nature, not available in mainland China, and headquartered in Singapore and Los Angeles. Cárdenas again underscored the bipartisan nature of today’s hearing. “You have been one of the few members to unite this committee,” he told Chew. Kari Paul here on the west coast, taking over the blog for the remainder of Chew’s hearing. Stand by for updates. The hearing is now in recess. As expected, two hours into the hearing we’re still hitting on a lot of the same questions. Does the CCP control TikTok decisions, either directly or indirectly? How does TikTok get around CCP laws that require companies provide access to user data? How does the company plan to alleviate the harmful impacts of its platform on teen mental health? It doesn’t appear many lawmakers are interested in hearing Chew’s response and in some cases rarely give him the opportunity to fully respond to their questions. That said, Chew is also repeating much of the same lines from his opening testimony when responding to questions. The WSJ report today, which has been cited by members of the committee at least three times, has not helped Chew at all given the impression lawmakers have from that story is that China would have control over whether or not ByteDance could be sold. Members have also used this hearing as an opportunity to promote their efforts to pass a federal privacy bill that limits how user data is collected and shared. Two moments have stood out as potentially damaging to Chew’s testimony. First, when Cammack pulled up a TikTok post that appeared to threaten the committee and the committee chair that had not been taken down by the company 41 days after it was first posted. Second, when Gus Bilirakis shared the story of Chase Nasca who died by suicide. Bilirakis alleged that it was TikTok content that lead him to do that and then proceeded to play a series of videos that discussed suicide. Representative Brett Guthrie goes back to the threatening video that Cammack presented and asks why and how it’s been up for 41 days. “We had a threat against our committee … you seem to be able to prevent this content in China … and yet it’s on your website,” Guthrie said. “You said earlier as soon as you find this information you take it down. How quickly does your algorithm detect keywords or content that involve illicit drug trafficking before these posts are self-reported or used by others? Chew says there are 40,000 moderators working on this, alongside automated systems … but no company can be perfect. Guthrie is expressing confusion on why Douyin, the ByteDance-owned China-based version of TikTok, is able to stamp out illicit drugs content entirely but TikTok isn’t able to do that. Chew said you have to deal with the reality of the country you’re operating in, but that it’s a shared challenge with other tech companies in the US. Essentially drug laws aren’t as strict here as it is in China. Representative John Sarbanes is asking whether TikTok is looking into how to make its platform less “manipulative”. Chew said the company was the first to implement the 60-minute watch limit and also prohibits users under 16 to use direct messages. Users under 16 also can’t go viral by design, Chew said. But Sarbanes points out that teens have been able to bypass the 60-minute time limit. “If you concluded that putting some reasonable limits in place … would lead some percentage of your users to leave TikTok and go somewhere else is that something you’re prepared to accept?” Chew said yes. Lawmakers are focusing more on teen and children mental health on TikTok now. Representative Gus Bilirakis shares a story of Chase Nasca, a 16-year-old boy who ended his life a year ago by stepping in front of a train. “I want to thank his parents for being here today, and allowing us to show this,” Bilirakis said. “Mr Chew your company destroyed their lives. I admire their courage to be here and share Chase’s story in the hopes it’ll prevent this from happening to other families. The content in Chase’s “For You” page wasn’t a window to discovery … instead his “For You” page was sadly a window to discover suicide. It is unacceptable, sir, that even after knowing all these dangers you still [contend] TikTok is something grand to behold.” Bilirakis then played a series of TikToks that promote suicidal ideation. “Do you have responsibility over the algorithms used by TikTok to prioritize content for its users,” he asks Chew. In his answer, Chew attempted to emphasize that TikTok shares mental health resources but Bilirakis pushes him on the question, taking his attempts to address what TikTok is doing to help teen mental health as a means to avoid answering his question or accept responsibility. Representative Kat Cammack has presented a video that was posted 41 days ago that shows a gun being shot. The text over the video says “me ASF at the House Energy and Commerce Committee…” and the caption includes the name of the chair of the committee, Cathy McMorris Rodgers. “I think this is a blatant display of how vulnerable people who use TikTok are, you couldn’t take action after 41 days when a clear threat, a very violent threat to the chairwoman of this committee and the members of this committee was posted on your platform,” Cammack said. “You damn well know that you cannot protect the data and security of this committee or the 150 million users of your app because it’s an extension of the CCP.” The chair did not allow Chew to respond. Important to note that members of the committee have repeatedly tried to establish Chew’s connection with ByteDance executives – some of whom, they say, work with or are affiliated with the CCP. Representative Diana DeGette is bringing up the WSJ report again and asking Chew for comment. He said that he’d have to get back to them because whether ByteDance would be forced to sell TikTok is still developing so he doesn’t have specifics but that Project Texas would protect US users no matter what. “Does TikTok share user information … overseas?” Degette asked. Chew said in the past, yes but with Project Texas that would no longer be the case. He reiterated that the efforts to protect user data through Project Texas is more than any other company has done. Representative Richard Hudson asked Chew about the reports that ByteDance employees have accessed user data of US journalists in order to investigate an internal leak of information. Chew says TikTok condemns this behavior. “We took swift disciplinary action against employees and are implementing measures to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” he said. Representative Anna Eshoo has asked how TikTok could get around Beijing’s security laws that require companies to provide data to the government and makes the reach of the law “extra-territorial”. “This is very clear,” Eshoo said. “Those are the laws of the PRC, how does TikTok convince the congress of the US that there can be a clean break? Why would the Chinese government sidestep their national law … in terms of user data?” Chew reiterated the plan is to move American data to American soil. Eshoo is not satisfied: “How can you promise the data will move to the US and be protected here?” Chew said he has seen no evidence that the Chinese government has access to our data. “They haven’t asked us,” he said. Eshoo said she doesn’t believe there’s a private sector in China. “When you look at their national law … I think there is a real problem relative to our national security about the protection of the user data.” Members of the committee have cited a Wall Street Journal report that indicates China would oppose a forced sale of TikTok. “China’s Commerce Ministry said Thursday that a sale or divestiture of TikTok would involve exporting technology and had to be approved by the Chinese government,” the article reads. Representative Michael Burgess said despite Chew’s assertions, China seems to believe its in control of TikTok and its software. Chew said that while TikTok is not available in mainland China, the founders of ByteDance are Chinese and they work with Chinese employees just like many companies around the world. Burgess has asked whether anyone from ByteDance “directly provide input, help or instruction for your testimony today”. Chew said he prepared for this hearing with his team in DC. As a reminder, ByteDance is TikTok’s parent company. Pallone said that he doesn’t believe Project Texas is sufficient and that the CCP will still be able to access data. Now he’s asking about some of TikTok’s financials including how much money the company makes off of targeted ads. Chew refuses to share it because the company is private and thus its financials are also private. “My concern here is primarily about the privacy issue the fact that TikTok is making all kinds of money by gathering private information about Americans … and then they sell it,” Pallone said, bringing up the privacy legislation he and Rodgers are pushing. “Would you commit to not selling data to anyone?” Chew said the company doesn’t sell data to data brokers, Pallone says he is talking about selling or sharing data to anyone. Chew said he’ll get back to him on the details. Chew said the company is committed to being transparent about data they collect and that he doesn’t believe the company collects any more data than any other tech platform. Pallone said that he’s not his point: He knows all tech companies collect data he doesn’t think they should and wants to see if Tiktok would commit to being a good actor and stop collecting data. Rodgers asked Chew whether he has regular contact with various executives at Bytedance. He said he was in regular contact with the parent company’s CEO. “All of these individuals work or are affiliated with the Chinese Communist party and are at the highest levels of leadership of ByteDance,” Rodgers responded. “A company where you previously served as CFO and where you regularly communicate with the CEO.” Shou Zi Chew, TikTok’s CEO, is beginning his testimony with an emphasis on his Singaporean heritage. He has tried this strategy before in a letter to lawmakers when he first took over the company. TikTok is run by a Singaporean based in Singapore, he wrote in that letter, and not beholden to the Chinese government. Chew is also emphasizing that the company’s 150 million users in the US use the platform for various purposes that includes educational videos. To address the lawmakers’ national security concerns, Chew is talking about Project Texas – an effort to move all US data to domestic servers. He said the company is deleting all user data that is backed up to servers outside the US, and that it should all be deleted later this year. “Trust is about actions we take, we have to earn your trust with decisions we make … the potential security, privacy … concerns are not unique to us. We believe what’s needed are clear transparent rules that address all tech companies,” Chew said. He ends with this: “There are more than 150 million users who love our platform and we know we have a responsibility to protect them which is why I am making the following commitments to you and all our users: 1) We will keep safety, particularly for teenagers as a top priority for us. 2) We will firewall protected US data from unwanted foreign access 3) TikTok will remain a place for free expression and not be manipulated by any government 4) We will be transparent and we will give access to third-party independent monitors to remain accountable for our commitments.” Ranking member Frank Pallone, a Democrat of New Jersey, is focused more on the spread of misinformation on TikTok, and the platform’s impact on teen mental health. He’s also taking this opportunity to speak to urge the passage of a bill that would create a federal privacy law that would reign in all of big tech’s data-collection practices. Good morning, the hearing has started. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the chair of the House energy and commerce committee, spoke passionately about her concerns with TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance. The main thrust of her argument is that TikTok poses a “grave threat” from foreign influence on American life. She claims that China requires companies to allow the government to access its data, by design. Rodgers tells Chew that he has to not just answer to Congress but also to the American people. Good morning and welcome to our liveblog of today’s interrogation of TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew by US Congress members. The panel, convened by the House committee on energy and commerce, will begin at 10am ET and is titled TikTok: How Congress Can Safeguard American Data Privacy And Protect Children From Online Harms. This marks the first appearance from a TikTok chief executive before US lawmakers. It comes as the political storm surrounding the China-owned social media platform intensifies, with the Biden administration threatening to ban the app entirely in the US. TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has long faced criticisms over the data it holds on US users – data that lawmakers fear could fall into the hands of the Chinese government. According to prepared statements shared in advance, Chew is anticipated to insist that TikTok has never, and would never, share US user data with the Chinese government, nor let the state manipulate what content is shown on the platform. “Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,” Chew said.

31,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-23,From Facebook intern to the crosshairs of Congress: TikTok chief’s stellar rise,"Shou Zi Chew has said the most gruelling experience of his life was a five-day survival course in the jungles of Borneo when he was serving as a conscript in Singapore’s armed forces. The TikTok chief executive, whose trans-global academic and business career has rapidly propelled him to the top job at one of the world’s biggest tech companies, will need to display some of that mettle as he battles to ensure the corporate survival of the controversial but immensely popular social video app. The 40-year-old Singaporean, who faces questioning by US lawmakers on Thursday amid talk of a possible ban in the US, came from a relatively modest background: his father worked in construction and mother in bookkeeping. His fate was transformed at the age of 12 when high marks on a national exam got him into an elite high school, where he added fluency in Mandarin to his native English. Following his military service – Chew is a reservist officer in the Singaporean army until he is 50 – he obtained a bachelor’s degree in economics from University College London. He stayed on in the UK capital, becoming a banker at Goldman Sachs for two years, investment experience that would eventually lead him to meet a young Zhang Yiming, the founder of TikTok’s parent, ByteDance, when he was developing the company in a crammed apartment in Beijing’s university district. In 2010, Chew gained his MBA from Harvard Business School, where he got his first experience of life in the tech sector with an internship at Facebook while the social networking company was still in startup mode before going public in 2012. It was also where he met his Taiwanese-American future wife Vivian Kao, with whom he has two children. Chew – whose TikTok profile was created in February last year and has just 23 posts, including videos of him attending the Super Bowl and NBA games as well as meeting celebrities such as Bill Murray – does not allow his children to use the app, having said last November that they are “too young”. After business school, Chew joined the venture capital firm DST, founded by the Israeli-Russian IT billionaire Yuri Milner, where his Mandarin qualified him to be its China-focused partner. This would see him make his pivotal visit to Zhang’s ByteDance in 2012 before the team created TikTok, resulting in Chew and his partners investing in the startup the following year. He also led investment in Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone maker with global ambitions to take on Apple, which he joined as chief financial officer in 2015 at the age of 32. Chew helped to secure financing that led to the company’s public listing three years later. At the time this was one of China’s biggest ever tech initial public offerings, although its share performance has since been mixed. He was made head of its international business in 2019. In 2021, Zhang persuaded Chew to join ByteDance as its first chief financial officer. Two months later, he was elevated to chief executive following the abrupt departure of the former Disney executive Kevin Mayer after just three months, as the Trump administration attempted to force a sale of TikTok’s US assets. Chew’s rise to the top of the tech industry landed him a spot on Fortune’s 40 under 40 list in 2021. The low-profile exec is now embarking on a media offensive as part of TikTok’s wider efforts to galvanise support to avert a ban in the US and other countries. “This could take TikTok away from all 150 million of you,” he said in a post appealing to US TikTok users.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/23/tiktok-harvard-graduate-ceo-battles-us-market-shou-zi-chew
32,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-23,TikTok to be banned from UK parliamentary devices,"Parliament is to ban the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok from “all parliamentary devices and the wider parliamentary network”, citing the need for cybersecurity. The move goes further than the ban last week of the app on government mobile phones and devices, covering the whole parliamentary network. That means that MPs and parliamentary staff who continue to have TikTok installed on personal devices will find the service blocked if they try to access it over parliamentary wifi. A parliament spokesperson said on Thursday: “Following the government’s decision to ban TikTok from government devices, the commissions of both the House of Commons and Lords have decided that TikTok will be blocked from all parliamentary devices and the wider parliamentary network. “Cybersecurity is a top priority for parliament. However we do not comment on specific details of our cyber or physical security controls, policies or incidents.” Multiple MPs have been outspoken about their desire to continue posting on the social video app even in the wake of the government’s ban. Grant Shapps, the secretary of state for energy security, responded to the ban last week by posting a censored clip from the film Wolf of Wall Street, where Leonardo Dicaprio’s character exclaims “I’m not fucking leaving” after deciding to fight the regulators. Other MPs on the platform include Conservatives Luke Evans and Marco Longhi, Labour’s Zarah Sultana, and the former health secretary Matt Hancock, who had the Conservative party whip suspended in 2022 for appearing on the TV programme I’m a Celebrity. MPs including Shapps will continue to be able to post on the platform from their own personal devices, but not through parliament networks. The latest ban was announced while TikTok’s chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, was giving evidence to a committee of the US House of Representatives. An American decision to ban federal employees from installing TikTok on work devices kicked off a wave of similar bans around the world. The Scottish government has also banned TikTok from its mobile phones and other corporate devices following discussions with the UK government. Scotland’s deputy first minister, John Swinney, said: “Devices managed by the Scottish government are configured in line with best practice from the National Cyber Security Centre, which helps us to manage any risk associated with the use of third-party applications. “Our decision to prohibit the use of TikTok follows engagement with the UK government on the potential tracking and privacy risks from certain social media apps. “Currently there is limited use of TikTok within government and limited need for staff to use the app on work devices. This ban will be implemented immediately. It does not extend to personal devices used by staff or the general public.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/23/tiktok-to-be-banned-from-uk-parliamentary-devices
33,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-20,Monday briefing: How TikTok became the centre of a geopolitical cybersecurity row,"Good morning. Last year, TikTok was the most downloaded app in the world. It has a reported user base of more than a billion people and remains the fastest-growing social media platform since 2020. But now a succession of countries have banned it from government devices – with the UK announcing late last week it will join the US, the EU and New Zealand in imposing controls. Whether or not you actually use it, TikTok’s ubiquity has meant that many of us engage with video content that has originated from the app as it migrates across other platforms. Beyond the general criticisms aimed at TikTok – its addictive nature, its mysterious algorithm, its “shoppertainment” model – the Chinese-owned social media company has attracted a lot of attention from western governments who cite the app as a security issue. Despite its insistence that user data is safe, TikTok has been unable to assuage suspicions that have been brewing since its popularity exploded five years ago. Government officials in the west have maintained that its ownership by Chinese tech giant ByteDance puts sensitive user data at risk of being accessed by the Chinese government. And as geopolitical tensions between China and the US continue to grow, TikTok has found itself in the firing line. This shift could have huge repercussions for the social media giant – yesterday, it was reported that the BBC has urged its staff to delete the app from their corporate mobile phones, and no ones knows who else might follow suit. I spoke to the Guardian’s global technology editor, Dan Milmo, about why TikTok has climbed to the top of the security agenda. That’s right after the headlines. Five big stories Police | The leader of Britain’s police chiefs, Martin Hewitt, has said the Metropolitan Police has no “God-given right” to exist in its current size if it cannot regain public trust that has rapidly deteriorated after a series of scandals. Hewitt, who is retiring after three decades in policing, has said it would take years for the force to regain the confidence of the public. Strikes | A cross-union group comprised of members from Britain’s biggest health unions are organising a campaign to reject the 5% pay increase being recommended by union leaders because it was well below inflation. Climate crisis | Fiame Naomi Mata’af, the prime minister of Samoa, has issued a desperate plea for action ahead of a landmark IPCC report that is expected to issue a scientific “final warning” on the climate emergency. “There are already examples in the Pacific of communities, whole communities, that have relocated to different countries,” she said. “They’re really having to address issues of sovereignty through loss of land.” Russia-China ties | Vladimir Putin has praised Xi Jinping as a “good old friend” in an article published in China on the eve of a state visit to Moscow by the Chinese president, his first since the invasion of Ukraine. Emergency services | The government has launched a new public warning system where siren-like alerts will be sent to mobile phones about events that may put life in danger, such as severe flooding, wildfires or extreme weather. The Cabinet Office is planning a nationwide trial next month. In depth: ‘TikTok aggressively harvests your data – but that’s pretty generic social media behaviour’ The US government has made its stance clear: Beijing-based ByteDance, TikTok’s owners, have to divest their stakes in the company or the video-sharing platform risks being banned from the country altogether. It is a dramatic escalation in the back and forth that has been happening between TikTok and the US government. But how much of this is really about TikTok? And what will happen next? *** What actually is the security risk? So far, there’s no hard evidence to suggest that TikTok has been asked to hand over user data to the Chinese state or that it is manipulating its algorithm to push pro-Chinese propaganda. Dan points out that its practices so far seem to be no different to any other social media platform: “The overarching debate about TikTok is that it aggressively harvests your data, your location, your likes etc. But that’s pretty generic social media behaviour – on a basic level it’s no different to anyone else.” This is not to say that the fears are completely unfounded: ByteDance itself admitted that employees used their own app to spy on reporters in an attempt to track down the journalists’ sources, severely damaging TikTok’s credibility. TikTok has also unveiled security plans in Europe and the US that will cost the company €1.2bn and $1.5bn respectively to convince western governments that it is protecting user data. All data of American users, for instance, would be stored within the US, or in Norway and Ireland for those accessing the app in Europe. Critics however are unconvinced that this is enough, saying that ultimately ByteDance has to comply with demands from the Chinese government. *** How likely is a sale? TikTok’s outsized cultural influence, paired with its highly engaged and growing user base means that it is a tremendous asset. However, Dan points out that selling still wouldn’t necessarily be smooth sailing. “There is an assumption among some experts in the field that the Chinese state will seek to block a divestment of TikTok from its Chinese owners because it owns precious IP [intellectual property] like its famed recommendation algorithm that makes its For You feed such a compelling experience,” Dan explains. Buying TikTok or a significant chunk of it would come with a lot of baggage and complex, unanswered questions about how exactly it could entirely unravel itself from ByteDance. Also, at a potential price of over $50bn for the US business alone, finding buyers that have pockets deep enough will be difficult. Companies like Snap would struggle to take that on, and there would be big antitrust concerns for any social media buyer. Microsoft and Oracle were potential suitors when Donald Trump’s administration first tried to force through a sale of TikTok US in 2020, but that process was derailed amid successful legal challenges from TikTok. And with the Chinese government in the background too, a sale could be messy. *** Will there be a nationwide ban? Rishi Sunak has set out what the UK intends to do about TikTok: copy everyone else. In this case, the British government seems happy to follow the example of its allies. “Quite clearly what the government announced this week was related to what the United States, Canada, Belgium and the European Commission has done,” Dan says. The logical next step is that if the US is able to follow through with its threats that the UK would follow in its footsteps. But a nationwide ban is a very big leap from banning civil servants and politicians from using the app on government phones. It’s become a staple part of many people’s social media diet and “an increasing number of people’s livelihoods depend on TikTok as creators, [so] moving to ban that entirely is quite a big step and I don’t think we’re there yet,” Dan says. It is also important to note that the question of banning TikTok in the US is not legally settled. While there is bipartisan political consensus, TikTok has previously been able to ward off pressure from the White House. “They successfully sued Donald Trump’s attempts to ban the app in the US, so there already is a precedent of legal defence there, which would make it quite difficult for Biden.” *** TikTok becomes more open TikTok’s transition from cultural phenomenon to geopolitical pariah is a symbol of the hardening relationship between the US, the west more broadly, and China. The spy balloons saga, rising tensions over Taiwan and China’s relationship with Russia has meant that TikTok is merely the latest site of contention about a much larger issue than a video-sharing app. But, TikTok has responded to its changing position, deciding it is time to come out of the shadows. “It’s suddenly become a much more public facing company. Its executives talk to journalists a lot more and it’s been making a lot more appearances in front of politicians on both sides of the Atlantic to try to state its case,” Dan says. Whether this is enough is yet to be seen. *** What’s next? It’s unlikely that this hostility will stop at TikTok. Other Chinese tech firms and products are likely in the crosshairs of western politicians, says Dan. “So the obvious question is who’s next? Because either way it seems like this is about China, not TikTok.” What else we’ve been reading It has been two decades since the UK and the US invaded Iraq, marking the start of a long, bloody war that was “based on flawed intelligence, months of lying to the world, and a casual disregard for international law”, write Emma Graham-Harrison and Salim Habib.

34,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-19,BBC urges staff to delete TikTok from company mobile phones,"The BBC has urged its staff to delete the Chinese-own social media app TikTok from corporate mobile phones. Guidance to BBC staff circulated on Sunday said: “We don’t recommend installing TikTok on a BBC corporate device unless there is a justified business reason. If you do not need TikTok for business reasons, TikTok should be deleted.” The move comes after the UK government banned the app on government-issued phones amid fears of sensitive data being accessed by the Chinese government, owing to its ownership by the Chinese internet company ByteDance. Explaining the move, the BBC guidance said: “The decision is based on concerns raised by government authorities worldwide regarding data privacy and security.” The BBC asked employees who have TikTok on their personal phones, but also use those devices for work reasons, to contact the organisation’s information security team in order to discuss “the type of BBC information that you are working with”. A BBC spokesperson said: “The BBC takes the safety and security of our systems, data and people incredibly seriously. We constantly review activity on third-party platforms – including TikTok – and will continue to do so.” The corporation said the use of TikTok on BBC corporate devices – which have been bought and paid for by the organisation – was still permitted for editorial and marketing purposes. But the spokesperson said the BBC would continue to monitor and assess the situation. The move marks a sharp change in approach from the BBC, which has embraced TikTok as a way of reaching new audiences. Its TikTok channel has been running for more than a year and it has recruited a team of four TikTok specialists. Earlier this month Denmark’s DR became the first national broadcaster to ban TikTok from staff work devices. It has gone further than the BBC by requiring staff to use only designated TikTok phones if they need the app for research purposes. On Friday the Cabinet Office said the government’s decision to ban TikTok from government phones was a “prudent and proportionate step”, after China criticised the move. The government said the ban did not extend to personal devices for government employees, ministers or the general public. The Cabinet Office said the ban was being imposed because TikTok users are required to hand over data including contacts, user content and geolocation data. Referring to similar government phone bans in the US, Canada, Belgium and the European Commission, the Cabinet Office said: “The government, along with our international partners, is concerned about the way in which this data may be used.” TikTok says it does not share data with China, but the country’s intelligence legislation requires companies to help the Communist party when requested. Critics fear this policy could expose data to Beijing, amid growing concerns about how China could use technology against the west. There are also concerns that the Chinese state could gain access to the TikTok’s recommendation algorithm, which curates what users see on the app, in order to manipulate what they view on the app’s main “For You” feed. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Britain accused ministers of acting “based on its political motive rather than facts”. Last week TikTok described the UK ban as “based on fundamental misconceptions and driven by wider geopolitics”. However, its denials of Chinese state interference have failed to convince the US government, which stepped up the pressure on TikTok significantly last week. TikTok said the Biden administration had asked TikTok’s Chinese owners to sell their stakes in the business, a move the company said would not address data concerns. TikTok’s chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, will be questioned by lawmakers in Washington DC on Thursday. Referring to the sale demand last week, he said: “So far I haven’t heard anything that cannot actually be solved by this.” TikTok has more than 1 billion users worldwide, including more than 100 million in the US. Previous attempts by the Trump administration to ban TikTok in the US, and to make the company sell stakes to US companies, foundered in the face of legal objections brought by the company. TikTok said: “We are disappointed with the guidance that the BBC has shared but welcome the fact TikTok can still be used as part of editorial, marketing and reporting purposes. The BBC has a strong presence on our platform, with multiple accounts from news through to music reaching our engaged community both in the UK and around the world. “We believe these bans have been based on fundamental misconceptions and driven by wider geopolitics. We remain in close dialogue with the BBC and are committed to working with them to address any concerns they have.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/19/bbc-urges-staff-to-delete-tiktok-from-company-mobile-phones
35,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-18,People are boiling their wooden spoons on TikTok. I won’t be joining them | Rachel Cooke,"A few weeks ago, I finally plucked up the courage and went in … to the shadowy place at the back of the fridge where no hand ever goes (sorry if you were expecting something more daring). To be clear, our fridge is quite clean, relatively speaking: nothing oozes in its salad crisper; no cheese rind awaits death in the place where the butter lives. But the top shelf, where I keep jars, open but not yet empty, was becoming too crowded. In the front row, I could see a Kilner of gherkins and some Daylesford blackcurrant and violet jam bought (ha) with a recent win on EuroMillions, and neither looked to me as if they’d give us botulism. But the Lord alone knew what lurked behind. Something had to be done. Two hours later, and the dishwasher was full of jars, and the bin of their (mostly unrecognisable) contents: a satisfying morning’s work, and one that got me thinking about what else in the kitchen I might profitably clean. The spice cupboard, which looks a bit dusty? The space I laughably call my pantry, which has lately taken on a somewhat forlorn aspect? What I absolutely did not consider, however, was joining the crowd by boiling my wooden spoons. I’m the child of a microbiologist. I hold to the notion that, broadly speaking, wood is naturally antibacterial. I’ve had the same chopping board for more than 15 years, and I’ve only ever wiped it with a damp, soapy cloth; no one has died so far. The creepy trend for boiling spoons – it is said to result in gruesome excretions – began on TikTok. A woman in the US called Lulaboo Jenkins posted a video of a ritual spoon-boiling that has been watched by 49 million people. I read about this, and even as I rolled my eyes – how utterly deranged, I thought – I recognised it as yet another sign of the strange state we are in. Our attitude to hygiene, and by extension to dirt in all its multifarious forms, is increasingly strange and stupid. Every city street is strewn with fast food wrappers; I’ve never known them to look more filthy. But while this seems to induce no disgust whatsoever in most people – they stroll on by, oblivious to the ketchup on their heels – much of the rest of life induces rank nausea. Still, we struggle to convince people to eat items that are past their sell-by date. Still, people cannot deal with food that has not been ruthlessly sanitised for them in advance. Fish must be decapitated, and meat wrapped in clingfilm; shoppers favour potatoes that carry no traces of soil, and apples that come in plastic bags. Something tells me that the spoon-boilers are the same people who are timid to the point of phobic when it comes to the distant prospect of mould; the carcass of a chicken; a foodstuff that has very briefly fallen on the floor; any kind of dish whose appearance is less than Insta perfect. It’s all highly paradoxical. What they cannot see does not disturb them; most would balk if they knew what went on behind the scenes so far as the food chain goes. But equally, what is invisible is also borderline terrifying. These are the people who are forever spraying their work surfaces with chemicals, and who get extremely tense around shared utensils. But back to wooden spoons – and in fact, to all things wooden. I love an aged wooden spoon; in every way, they are more aesthetically pleasing than new (or boiled) ones. In junk shops, I’m always on the hunt for ancient bread boards. They are so beautiful; I favour those with Bible verses carved around their edges. Life in the kitchen should involve pleasing haptic experiences, and there is nothing better than holding in your hand an object that is worn with use and love, but which is still useful. I may have mentioned before that I own an old bread knife with a wooden handle, on which are written the words “Manners makyth man”. The first “m” is almost missing now, the victim of several generations of thumbs. This knife is no longer quite sharp enough for some modish crusts, but using it makes me feel happy and grounded: the kind of person (even more than usually) who couldn’t care less about a few germs.",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/18/people-are-boiling-their-wooden-spoons-on-tiktok-i-wont-be-joining-them
36,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-17,Why is TikTok banned from government phones – and should the rest of us be worried?,"TikTok is wildly popular, with more than 1 billion people consuming its short video posts around the world. But the app is less favoured by politicians in key markets such as the US and UK, where it has been banned from government-issued phones over security fears. We answer your questions about why TikTok has become a lightning rod for suspicion of Chinese state espionage – and whether nationwide bans are likely. Why has TikTok been banned from UK government phones? The main concerns with TikTok relate to data and the fact that it is owned by the Beijing-based ByteDance, a Chinese internet company. Could the Chinese state demand access to data generated by TikTok’s global user base and, for instance, create profiles of people it is interested in, such as government employees in other countries? The UK government raised data concerns in its statement explaining why it was taking the “prudent” step of removing TikTok from government-issued devices. It said the app was able to access user data from devices, including contacts and geolocation. According to a report by the Australian-US cybersecurity firm Internet 2.0, TikTok’s app can access a user’s calendar, other running applications, wifi networks, and even the sim card serial number. Referring to similar bans by the US, Canada and the European Commission, the UK government said: “The government, along with our international partners, is concerned about the way in which this data may be used.” TikTok maintains that its data is stored outside China in Singapore and the US. It is also proposing to store American and European user data in third-party servers in the US, Ireland and Norway. This has not been enough to assuage the concerns of critics, who also fear that the Chinese state could manipulate TikTok’s recommendation algorithm, which curates what people see on the app’s For You feed. Why is it not being banned from personal phones in the UK? The government said the “proportionate step” did not extend to personal devices for civil servants, ministers or the general public. However, it added that individuals should be aware of “each social media platform’s data policies” before downloading them. TikTok has updated its privacy policy to tell European users that their data can be accessed in China – in specific circumstances. The decision to declare TikTok a risk on government devices but not on anyone else’s has led to experts calling for more clarity. “The bottom line is that if there is a cybersecurity issue for the government users, the same applies to all of us,” says Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University. “The only argument might be that boring users such as me are not of interest, but there are plenty of professionals outside government where confidentiality is very important. Journalism, legal, medical and so on. If there is a security issue that nobody has found – and many have looked – then please tell us all so we can all delete it.” Why are there concerns about the Chinese state accessing TikTok data and its algorithm? TikTok is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, which has led to politicians in the US, the UK and elsewhere voicing fears that Chinese officials could demand access to TikTok’s user data and source code under domestic laws including the National Intelligence Law of 2017, which states that all organisations and citizens shall “support, assist and cooperate” with national intelligence efforts. TikTok says it has not received a request from the Chinese government for its data and that, if it did, it would refuse. The US government does not believe TikTok, and this week confirmed that the Biden administration had asked TikTok’s Chinese owners to sell their stakes in the company or face a complete ban in a key market where it has more than 100 million users. TikTok says ByteDance is 60% owned by external investors including the US private equity firm KKR, 20% by its employees and 20% by its founders, Zhang Yiming and Liang Rubo, who carry stronger voting rights than the other shareholders. Can TikTok user data be accessed within China, including by the Chinese state? TikTok has long insisted that user data from western nations does not enter China, where ByteDance is based. But time and again, the company has admitted exceptions to this rule. In a privacy policy update from late 2022, the company admitted that European users may have their data accessed by employees in China, “based on a demonstrated need to do their job, subject to a series of robust security controls and approval protocols”. In 2022, a BuzzFeed investigation revealed a rash of situations in which engineers in China would have access to US data, lasting at least until January 2022. The data was “stored” in the US, but with access controls that allowed staff elsewhere to access it, according to the investigation. The similar functionality of TikTok and its Chinese sister app Douyin suggests overlap between the engineering teams, but the extent to which resources are shared has remained fuzzy. Analysis of both apps suggests that they may share parts of their source code and are developed from a common code base, according to CitizenLab. TikTok’s credibility was also damaged last year when ByteDance admitted that employees had used the app to spy on reporters. Can the recommendation algorithm be manipulated by a state actor? The app’s much vaunted “For You” page has a complex recommendation algorithm that takes into account a huge range of signals, both explicit and implicit, to decide what content a given user should be shown. Despite efforts to introduce transparency to how the company operates, the “FYP” is, like many recommendation algorithms, a black box for users: the total count of signals, how they are applied, and how they result in any given piece of content appearing is ultimately impossible to see from the outside, and difficult even for TikTok itself to answer, given the nature of modern machine learning techniques. That means it is also difficult for the company to counter fears that the recommendation algorithm could be silently tampered with by a state actor, either through pressure at a corporate level, or through corrupting a small number of employees directly. In 2019, the Guardian revealed that TikTok’s moderation guidelines helped promote Beijing’s view of foreign policy, banning the promotion of separatist agendas in Tibet and Northern Ireland; the company says it now writes its moderation guidelines locally, but some fear that a similar approach would be harder to uncover if applied through automatic selective promotion and demotion of videos.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/17/why-is-tiktok-banned-from-government-phones-and-should-rest-of-us-be-worried

Asked whether the submarines could be obsolete by the time they hit the waters in the 2040s, given rapid technological advancements, Marles said to “flip the question”. “How confident are we that the veil of the sea will be lifted by 2050 such that we don’t need a submarine capability? Well, that would be a negligently risky call to make on the part of any Australian government.” You can listen to the episode from 7am tomorrow, or read a sneak preview here. Top news Another US bank in trouble | First Republic is the latest US bank to hit tough times, with Wall Street giants stepping in to provide the mid-sized bank a $45bn rescue package. Cash-short banks have borrowed a staggering $447bn from the US central bank in the past week to prevent a crisis spreading through the global financial system. The Australian treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says not to worry, however, as our banking system is “well placed … to withstand some of the vulnerability”.

Australia buys US cruise missiles | To accompany the Virginia class submarines being bought from the US, Australia is spending $1.3bn to buy 220 Tomahawk cruise missiles. The Pentagon says the sale will “enhance the capability of US Forces operating alongside them globally”. Productivity Commission report drops | And among its 71 recommendations is a contentious idea to allow the Fair Work Commission to revise minimum wages in awards to “expand flexibility for many small businesses”, potentially cutting pay for some. Chalmers says the government “won’t be taking up every idea”, adding that a review of the Productivity Commission is under way. Global water emergency | Global fresh water demand will outstrip supply by 40% by 2030, say experts. The landmark report listed seven recommendations for governments to address the looming crisis. Separately, Australians consume bottled water more than almost everyone else in the world – bar Singapore. We spend, on average, $580 buying 504L of bottled water, despite most of us having drinkable water available to us from our kitchen tap. New Zealand bans TikTok on government devices | New Zealand follows in the footsteps of the US and Canada to enact such bans, as tensions between the US and China heat up over Chinese ownership of the popular platform.

38,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-17,‘I’m not a doctor just FYI’: the influencers paid to hawk drugs on TikTok,"A young TikTok user has long, wavy hair, glowing makeup and a radiant smile. She’s slim and wants you to know exactly why: she’s using Wegovy, a prescription drug originally developed to treat diabetes that’s become a popular drug for weight loss. In one clip, she picks up the medication from a pharmacy, lip-syncing to Cardi B, then demonstrates in a following clip how she injects it into her leg. A caption flashes across the screen: “I’m not a doctor just FYI.” Moments later she advises her nearly 20,000 followers on how to get started on the drug. “Start on the 0.25 mg,” she says directly into camera. “Work your way up with each dose. Do not skip doses. I do not want any of you feeling sick.” She’s what’s called a patient influencer. They have no medical training and claim that they’re simply sharing their personal experiences with their TikTok and Instagram followers. But in this quickly growing and largely unregulated arena, it’s gotten harder to tell when influencing crosses legal and ethical lines. Many patient influencers offer prescription drug advice to their followers without always revealing their relationships with drug companies, according to Erin Willis, a University of Colorado, Boulder, associate professor who authored a study about patient influencers released this week. Since patient influencers often share highly personal, vulnerable stories about their own health conditions, audiences find them trustworthy: a 2020 survey by a Wego, a major patient influencer agency, found that 51% of respondents said they mostly or completely trusted patient influencers, compared with just 14% who said the same for lifestyle influencers. An accompanying blogpost explains: “These patient leaders have built a well-established foundation of authenticity and trust in their communities.” In exchange for hawking a health product or service, a patient influencer can expect to earn anywhere from “the low hundreds to a few thousand dollars” per social media post, depending on the health condition and the size of their online following, according to Amrita Bhowmick, the chief community officer at Health Union, a marketing firm that bought Wego in 2021. Patient influencers can do this thanks to some of the world’s most permissive laws on prescription drug marketing. The US is one of two countries (the other is New Zealand) that allow direct-to-consumer (DTC) ads for prescription drugs. Since 1997, the Food and Drug Administration has allowed drug companies to push prescription medications on American airwaves as long as the ads are truthful, explain what the drug has been approved to treat, mention its major risks, and contain a disclaimer like “talk to your doctor”. Studies find DTC ads lead to doctors prescribing them more – driving the market for these ads to nearly $7bn last year, industry statistics show. There are no published figures on the size of the patient influencer industry – but all indications are that it’s booming, says Willis. Medical ad agencies are typically tight-lipped about using patient influencers, but “they’re all engaged in this practice … this is a strategy that the pharmaceutical companies have found that works,” she says. Last summer, Willis spoke at a pharmaceutical marketing conference and asked the audience to raise their hands if they used patient influencers – nearly the whole room did. Part of what makes patient influencers effective is that they often push messaging further than what would be allowed on media like TV, where ads are far more closely scrutinized by regulators like the FDA and Federal Trade Commission. Willis calls patient influencing “an interactive form of advertising” that’s “difficult to regulate, if it’s been regulated at all”. (In an emailed statement, an FDA spokesperson said the agency “takes its responsibilities seriously and will continue to monitor promotions and communications regarding prescription drugs through its surveillance operations, which include online platforms”.) Willis found that all 26 patient influencers she spoke to in her study viewed themselves as “experts” and framed their efforts as raising awareness by sharing their own experiences. But some said they had discussed medications beyond those that they had taken, and many said they had discussed medications with followers over private messages. It’s those less visible kinds of content – including short-form and disappearing video – that are particularly concerning to Willis: “We don’t actually really know what all patients are doing, or what content they’re posting, or if they’re disclosing their relationship with pharmaceutical companies.” In an email to the Guardian, Health Union’s Bhowmick says the company recruits and approves its influencers, whom it calls “patient leaders”, based on their “existing online presence”, or their participation on message boards that Health Union has set up for specific medical conditions, such as Migraine.com. Bhowmick, who helped Willis analyze her findings, says the company shares Willis’s concerns and “works with all our patient leaders to ensure they follow our best practices and community rules in all online activities – such as not providing medical advice and adhering to FTC guidelines for sponsored activities”. Right now, we can only take their word for it. While federal law requires pharmaceutical companies to disclose the amount of money they pay doctors, no such rule exists for patients. And if an influencer doesn’t reveal that they’re on a drug company’s payroll, there’s no way to tell if it’s an advertisement that should be subject to regulation. On a recent TikTok post by the young Wegovy influencer, one of her followers commented: “I’ve been on it for 3 weeks and haven’t lost a single pound. Pls tell me it will start to work.” The influencer responded: “Bump up the dose.” Another commenter complains: “Made me soooo sick. Projectile vomiting because I didn’t poop for 10-15 days at a time.” The TikToker replies: “Stoppp!!! Omg!! Did you do the .25 dose??” With no listed sponsorships on her profile, it’s not clear whether she’s broken any advertising rules. And with the countless patient influencers out there – Health Union alone boasts a network of “over 100,000 patient leaders” – it’s hard to say how many social media users are dispensing unvetted medical advice, or making money while doing so. A big problem, Willis says, is there remains an “alarming lack of research” on the industry – and that research is difficult because “no one’s willing to talk about it”. “When you ask advertising professionals, they’re not going to tell you much because of NDAs that they sign,” she says. And in her most recent study, “none of the influencers I spoke to were going to get into the weeds of the relationship [with companies] or the contracts with me. My thought is, if nothing is wrong about the practice, then why isn’t more known about it?” This article was amended on 17 March 2023. An earlier version incorrectly attributed the assertion that influencers may not reveal their ties to drug companies to the study rather than to Willis’s own observations.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/17/patient-influencers-tiktok-instagram-medical-prescription-drugs
39,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-17,The TikTok wars – why the US and China are feuding over the app,"TikTok is once again fending off claims that its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, would share user data from its popular video-sharing app with the Chinese government, or push propaganda and misinformation on its behalf. China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday accused the US itself of spreading disinformation about TikTok’s potential security risks following a report in the Wall Street Journal that the committee on foreign investment in the US – part of the treasury department – was threatening a US ban on the app unless its Chinese owners divest their stake. So are the data security risks real? And should users be worried that the TikTok app will be wiped off their phones? Here’s what to know: What are the concerns about TikTok? Both the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share TikTok user data – such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers – with China’s authoritarian government. A law implemented by China in 2017 requires companies to give the government any personal data relevant to the country’s national security. There’s no evidence that TikTok has turned over such data, but fears abound due to the vast amount of user data it, like other social media companies, collects. Concerns around TikTok were heightened in December when ByteDance said it fired four employees who accessed data on two journalists from BuzzFeed News and the Financial Times while attempting to track down the source of a leaked report about the company. Just last week, the director of the FBI, Christopher Wray, told the Senate intelligence committee that TikTok “screams” of national security concerns and that China could also manipulate the algorithm to spread misinformation. “This is a tool that is ultimately within the control of the Chinese government, and to me, it screams out with national security concerns,” Wray said. How is the US responding? The White House national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, declined to comment when asked on Thursday to address the Chinese foreign ministry’s comments about TikTok, citing the review being conducted by the committee on foreign investment. Kirby also could not confirm that the administration sent TikTok a letter warning that the US government may ban the application if its Chinese owners don’t sell its stake but added, “we have legitimate national security concerns with respect to data integrity that we need to observe.” In 2020, then president Donald Trump and his administration sought to force ByteDance to sell off its US assets and ban TikTok from app stores. Courts blocked the effort, and President Joe Biden rescinded Trump’s orders but directed an in-depth study of the issue. A planned sale of TikTok’s US assets was also shelved as the Biden administration negotiated a deal with the app that would address some of the national security concerns. In Congress, US senators Richard Blumenthal and Jerry Moran, a Democrat and a Republican, respectively, wrote a letter in February to the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, urging the committee on foreign investment panel, which she chairs, to “swiftly conclude its investigation and impose strict structural restrictions” between TikTok’s US operations and ByteDance, including potentially separating the companies. At the same time, lawmakers have introduced measures that would expand the Biden administration’s authority to enact a national ban on TikTok. The White House has already backed a Senate proposal that has bipartisan support. How has TikTok already been restricted? On Thursday, British authorities said they were banning TikTok on government-issued phones on security grounds, after similar moves by the EU’s executive branch, which temporarily banned TikTok from employee phones. Denmark and Canada have also announced efforts to block the app on government-issued phones. Last month, the White House said it would give US federal agencies 30 days to delete TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. Congress, the US armed forces and more than half of US states had already banned the app on official devices. What does TikTok say? A TikTok spokesperson, Maureen Shanahan, said the company was already answering security concerns through “transparent, US-based protection of US user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification”. In June, TikTok said it would route all data from US users to servers controlled by Oracle, the Silicon Valley company it chose as its US tech partner in 2020 in an effort to avoid a nationwide ban. But it is storing backups of the data in its own servers in the US and Singapore. The company said it expects to delete US user data from its own servers, but it has not provided a timeline as to when that would occur. The TikTok CEO, Shou Zi Chew, is will testify next week before the House energy and commerce committee about the company’s privacy and data-security practices, as well as its relationship with the Chinese government. In the lead-up to the hearing, Chew has quietly met with several lawmakers – some of whom remain unmoved by their conversation with the 40-year-old executive. After convening with Chew in February, Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado who previously called on Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores, said he remained “fundamentally concerned that TikTok, as a Chinese-owned company, is subject to dictates from the Chinese Communist party”. Meanwhile, TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, has been trying to position itself as more of an international company – and less of a Chinese company that was founded in Beijing in 2012 by its current chief executive, Liang Rubo, and others. Theo Bertram, TikTok’s vice-president of policy in Europe, said in a tweet on Thursday that ByteDance “is not a Chinese company”. Bertram said its ownership consists of 60% global investors, 20% employees and 20% founders. Its leaders are based in cities such as Singapore, New York, Beijing and other metropolitan areas. Are the security risks legitimate? It depends on whom you ask. Some tech privacy advocates say that while the potential abuse of privacy by the Chinese government is concerning, other tech companies have data-harvesting business practices that also exploit user information. “If policymakers want to protect Americans from surveillance, they should advocate for a basic privacy law that bans all companies from collecting so much sensitive data about us in the first place, rather than engaging in what amounts to xenophobic showboating that does exactly nothing to protect anyone,” said Evan Greer, director of the non-profit advocacy group Fight for the Future. Karim Farhat, a researcher with the Internet Governance Project at Georgia Tech, said a TikTok sale would be “completely irrelevant to any of the alleged ‘national security’ threats” and go against “every free market principle and norm” of the state department’s internet freedom principles. Others say there is legitimate reason for concern. People who use TikTok might think they’re not doing anything that would be of interest to a foreign government, but that’s not always the case, said Anton Dahbura, executive director of the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute. Important information about the US is not strictly limited to nuclear power plants or military facilities; it extends to other sectors, such as food processing, the finance industry and universities, Dahbura said. Is there precedent for banning tech companies? Last year, the US banned the sale of communications equipment made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE, citing risks to national security. But banning the sale of items could be more easily done than banning an app, which is accessed through the web. Such a move might also go to the courts on grounds that it could violate the first amendment as some civil liberties groups have argued.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/16/the-tiktok-wars-why-the-us-and-china-are-feuding-over-the-app
40,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-17,New Zealand to ban TikTok from government devices,"New Zealand’s parliament will ban TikTok from all parliamentary devices, amid mounting international security concerns surrounding the app. The country’s MPs were informed by parliamentary service on Friday that the Chinese-owned video-sharing app would be blocked from all parliamentary devices at the end of the month, and were told via email that “the Service has determined that the risks are not acceptable in the current New Zealand parliament environment”. “The decision to block the TikTok application has been made based on our own analysis and following discussion with our colleagues across government and internationally,” the email reads. New Zealand’s decision follows similar rulings by some of its major western allies. Earlier in the week, the UK government announced that TikTok would be banned, effective immediately, from ministers’ and civil servants’ mobile phones. The US, Canada, and the European Commission already had a ban in place. TikTok is owned by Beijing-based company ByteDance, and concerns surrounding its security have centred on whether the Chinese state could access data recorded by the app’s billion users, or manipulate the algorithm to push pro-China content. TikTok has denied its data or algorithms can be accessed or manipulated by the Chinese government, saying it has not been asked for data, and would refuse any future requests. In recent months, however, as relationships with Beijing have been strained by the shooting down of Chinese surveillance balloons, a number of western countries have introduced bans on the app on parliamentary devices – with the US going a step further, to consider an outright ban on the app. In early March, the White House said it supported legislation that would allow the administration to ban TikTok and other foreign-based technologies completely if they pose national security threats. The New Zealand ban does not specifically cover MPs’ personal phones, but those phones must have the app uninstalled in order to access any parliament applications. A number of New Zealand MPs use TikTok to post political videos and commentary. Among the most prolific are Te Pāti Māori leaders Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi, and Act party leader David Seymour. The Māori party had not responded to requests for comment by time of publication. A spokesperson for Act said the party’s TikTok account “is run from a personal phone free of parliamentary information. We have been taking this precaution for some time.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/17/new-zealand-to-ban-tiktok-from-government-devices
41,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-16,MPs and peers ask information commissioner to investigate TikTok,"A cross-party group of MPs and peers have asked the information commissioner to investigate whether the Chinese-owned TikTok’s handling of personal information is in breach of UK law. The letter from the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) argues that TikTok cannot be compliant with data protection rules – and comes just hours after the UK announced a ban on the popular video-sharing app appearing on ministers’ and officials’ government-owned phones. IPAC believes TikTok could ultimately be forced to shut operations in the UK if it cannot find a way of complying, amid escalating western pressure on the company because of its Chinese ownership and the security of the data of its millions of users. But TikTok said it is a victim of “fundamental misconceptions” which it earlier complained were “driven by wider geopolitics” in which ordinary people play no part – and that it had begun work on a European data security plan to head off the legal concern. Earlier on Thursday, Oliver Dowden, the Cabinet Office minister, said that following a security review by UK intelligence officials, the app would be banned from the government phones of ministers, advisers and civil servants “with immediate effect”. Dowden said TikTok required users to give permission for the app to access data stored on the device, which is then collected and stored by the company – and can be accessed from China. Allowing such permissions gives TikTok access to a range of data, including contacts, user content and geolocation data. Dowden said this justified the ban because there was “a specific risk with government devices”. Britain joined the US, the European Commission, Canada and Belgium in banning TikTok on government devices in recent weeks amid a further deterioration of relations with China. A UK foreign policy review earlier this week described Beijing as posing an “epoch-defining challenge” to the west. But China accused the UK of abusing the concept of national security. “The decision was made by the UK side based on its political motive rather than facts,” an embassy spokesperson said, adding that it “undermines the confidence of the international community in the UK’s business environment” and would hurt British interests. Dowden’s announcement marks a sharp U-turn from the UK’s previous position and also came a few hours after TikTok said its owner, ByteDance, had been told by Washington to sell the app or face a possible ban in the country. The fresh complaint from the MPs and peers was made by a group including Labour, Conservative and Lib Dems, and is intended to ask the Chinese-owned company wider questions potentially affecting all of its users. One of the MPs, Carolyn Harris, representing Labour, also said she was “deleting her TikTok account today” and “encouraging others to do the same”. Harris, whose videos regularly notch up tens of thousands of views, said she had believed TikTok was a good way of communicating about her chosen campaign issues, including menopause awareness. But the MP added: “I don’t want my constituents being exposed to the Chinese Communist party’s data harvesting. So I believe MPs have a responsibility to set an example”. At the heart of the complaint is TikTok’s acknowledgment that user data can in some circumstances be accessed from China, and so outside UK safeguards. “It is my understanding that TikTok cannot implement appropriate safeguards to protect personal data that is transferred outside of the UK and EEA region,” wrote Lord Bethell, a Conservative peer, who is another complainant. Other members of the IPAC seeking answers from the information commissioner include the Conservatives Iain Duncan Smith and Tim Loughton, the Lib Dems Wera Hobhouse and Alistair Carmichael, and Labour’s Sarah Champion. Particular concern centres on a 2017 national security law in China, which requires organisations and citizens to “support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work”. It has been cited in the past to justify complete bans on kit made by Huawei, also a Chinese company, in UK and other 5G telecoms networks. Caroline Carruthers, a data consultant, said the concerns of MPs and peers should be examined by the Information Commissioner’s Office because any company that sends its data to China cannot guarantee that the way it is processed will adhere to UK laws. TikTok has told European users – and MPs in evidence given to parliament – that their data can be accessed by staff in China for limited reasons such as checking the performance of its algorithms. “Lord Bethell has a good point that this is a grey area in law, where we have a potential for the cross-country data transfer laws in the UK to be contradicted by the National Intelligence Law in China, for instance.” A spokesperson for the ICO said the letter raised “serious concerns” that it would review. “Protecting people’s rights is an important part of our work, and we work closely with organisations, including scrutinising the privacy practices of the big tech platforms. This letter raises serious concerns, and we will be reviewing it in detail,” they added. TikTok said it had begun work on “a comprehensive plan” to protect European user data, including storing UK user data in its European datacentres and including third-party independent oversight of its approach. A TikTok spokesperson added that the claims in the letter were “based on fundamental misconceptions”. They said “TikTok’s user data is stored in the US and Singapore, not China” and that the company was incorporated outside of China. “We comply with strict data laws, such as GDPR, in the UK and EU, which also govern data transfers,” they added. Earlier in the day, responding to the UK government ban, TikTok also blamed “wider geopolitics, in which TikTok, and our millions of users in the UK, play no part”.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/16/mps-and-peers-ask-information-commissioner-to-investigate-tiktok
42,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-16,Will UK follow US in demanding TikTok be sold by its Chinese owner?,"When asked this week whether the UK would ban TikTok on government phones, Rishi Sunak’s response signalled a change in stance: “We look at what our allies are doing.” Previously ministers had seemed sanguine, even saying that whether or not the app stayed on someone’s phone should be a matter of “personal choice”. Not any more. The UK’s allies are turning against TikTok and it was when Sunak said he was watching their actions closely that a government ban became inevitable. The US, Canada and the EU’s executive arm have already decided to strip the app from official devices. It is now a matter of geopolitical choice. TikTok is owned by the Beijing-based ByteDance. The fear among its critics on both sides of the Atlantic is that the Chinese state can access data generated by its more than 1 billion users and manipulate its recommendation algorithm in order to push a China-friendly point of view to unsuspecting users. There is no hard evidence this is the case and TikTok says it would refuse any data request from the Chinese government, although the UK government cited concerns about “the way in which this [user] data may be used” for the ban on Thursday. But tensions over Taiwan, concerns that China will supply weaponry to Russia, the shooting down of a spy balloon that hovered over the US and warnings of state espionage have created a toxic backdrop to those denials. And on Monday a refreshed integrated review of UK defence and foreign policy described China as an “epoch-defining” challenge. TikTok’s reputation was severely damaged last year when ByteDance admitted employees had attempted to use the app to spy on reporters. TikTok will be concerned that Sunak will match each upward ratchet in pressure from his counterparts. On Wednesday the Biden administration demanded the platform’s Chinese owner sell the app or face a complete ban. Will the UK ultimately threaten the same? If geopolitics is the leading factor in these moves, as opposed to hard proof that TikTok poses a security threat, then it is likely every deterioration in relations between China and the west will push the app further along the road to a complete ban or forced divestment from its owners in the UK and elsewhere. Indeed, a forced sale in the US – if the Chinese government lets TikTok’s owners do so – could lead to TikTok being peeled off from ByteDance in its entirety. The shooting down of a Chinese spy balloon off the east coast of the US last month was followed by reports that negotiations between TikTok and the Biden administration over a deal to resolve security concerns had stalled, while this week the White House gave its support to a Senate bill giving the president the power to ban TikTok. TikTok’s attempts to assuage those concerns – for instance announcing plans to store US and European user data on third-party data servers – seem to have failed with the current American president in the same way they did with his immediate predecessor, who also tried to force a divestment of TikTok’s US business. The backstop used by TikTok’s critics is the existence of Chinese laws that could force ByteDance to cooperate with Beijing authorities, including the national intelligence law of 2017, which states that all organisations and citizens shall “support, assist and cooperate” with national intelligence efforts. For many, this is enough evidence. Perhaps eliminating the concerns over Chinese interference by selling TikTok to non-Chinese investors is the only way to quell the critics. But there are plenty of other aspects of the Chinese tech industry – from Huawei mobile phones to other electronic devices – that are just as capable of eliciting similar fears. Without strong supporting evidence there is no way of knowing how proportionate the UK government is being – and the same could be true for moves against other Chinese tech interests.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/16/will-uk-follow-us-in-demanding-tiktok-be-sold-by-its-chinese-owner
43,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-16,US threatens to ban TikTok unless Chinese owners divest,"The Biden administration has threatened to ban TikTok in the US unless the social media company’s Chinese owners divest their stakes in it, according to news reports on Wednesday. The move, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, is the most dramatic in a series of escalations by US officials and legislators, driven by fears that US user data held by the company could be passed on to China’s government. It also comes amid a global backlash to the popular video-based app over concerns about the potential for Chinese spying, with countries including the UK, Canada and Australia recently moving to ban the app from government phones. The US has already banned TikTok on federal government devices but this marks the first time under Biden’s administration that a potential nationwide ban on TikTok has been threatened. Any US ban would face significant legal hurdles. Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, had tried to ban TikTok in 2020 but was blocked by the courts. A TikTok spokesperson, Brooke Oberwetter, told Reuters that the company had recently heard from the US Treasury-led committee on foreign investment in the United States (CFIUS), which demanded that the Chinese owners of the app sell their shares, and said otherwise they would face a possible US ban of the video app. TikTok is one of the world’s most popular social networks with more than 100 million US users. The Journal said 60% of shares in ByteDance, which owns TikTok, are owned by global investors, 20% by employees and 20% by its founders. CFIUS, a powerful national security body, in 2020 had unanimously recommended that ByteDance divest TikTok. “If protecting national security is the objective, divestment doesn’t solve the problem: a change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access,” TikTok’s Oberwetter said in a statement. The move comes as TikTok’s CEO, Shou Zi Chew, is due to appear before the US Congress next week. TikTok and CFIUS have been negotiating for more than two years on data security requirements. TikTok said it has spent more than $1.5bn on rigorous data security efforts and rejects spying allegations. TikTok said on Wednesday that “the best way to address concerns about national security is with the transparent, US-based protection of US user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification”. China accused the U S of spreading disinformation and suppressing TikTok. The US has yet to present evidence that TikTok threatens its national security and was using the excuse of data security to abuse its power to suppress foreign companies, the foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, told reporters at a daily briefing. “The US should stop spreading disinformation about data security, stop suppressing the relevant company, and provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for foreign businesses to invest and operate in the US,” Wang said. The news of a potential US ban followed reports this week that Britain is moving forward with its own plan to ban TikTok on government cellphones. The European Commission announced a similar ban last month, and on Monday, Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, hinted that he may follow suit, saying he would take “whatever steps are necessary” to protect Britain’s security. The cabinet office’s announcement of a potential ban could come as early as Thursday, sources told the Guardian, which reported that some critics and experts were calling for Britain to extend the ban to also cover personal phones of officials and ministers. Talk of restrictions across the globe have escalated in recent weeks after news of the Chinese spy balloon that was found hovering over the US. The scandal prompted a US congressional committee to move forward with legislation that would empower the US president to ban the app. Michael McCaul, a GOP congressman and chair of that committee, said he feared TikTok was akin to “spy balloon in your phone”. Amid the increasing scrutiny, TikTok earlier this month announced a data security plan that said would protect user information across Europe. That plan, called Project Clover, involves data storage on servers in Ireland and Norway, with a third-party IT company vetting any transfers of data outside of Europe.

44,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-16,UK bans TikTok from government mobile phones,"Britain is to ban the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok from ministers’ and civil servants’ mobile phones, bringing the UK in line with the US and the European Commission and reflecting deteriorating relations with Beijing. The decision marks a sharp U-turn from the UK’s previous position and came a few hours after TikTok said its owner, ByteDance, had been told by Washington to sell the app or face a possible ban in the country. The UK government’s announcement was made on Thursday by Oliver Dowden, the Cabinet Office minister, in the Commons. He said the ban was “with immediate effect”. The decision follows a review of TikTok by government cybersecurity experts that began in November, Dowden said, and will cover ministers’ and civil servants’ work phones, but not their personal phones. “This is a proportionate move based on a specific risk with government devices,” he added. The UK Cabinet Office said TikTok required users to give permission for the app to access data stored on the device, which is then collected and stored by the company. Allowing such permissions gives the company access to a range of data, including contacts, user content, and geolocation data. Dowden said this justified the ban. At least two cabinet ministers use TikTok. Michelle Donelan, the science and technology secretary, and Grant Shapps, the energy security and net zero secretary, have an account on the app, which is used by millions of young people and many celebrities and influencers. The decision brings the UK in line with the US government and the European Commission, both of which announced similar bans on TikTok in the past month, and it demonstrates how fast western trust in China and TikTok has deteriorated in recent months. But it marks a sharp reverse from the UK’s previously relaxed position. Just over a fortnight ago Donelan said the UK would not follow other governments and that the decision to install the app should be for an individual politician or minister to make. “As a Conservative, I strongly believe in personal choice,” she said. A TikTok spokesperson said the company was disappointed. “We believe these bans have been based on fundamental misconceptions and driven by wider geopolitics, in which TikTok, and our millions of users in the UK, play no part. We remain committed to working with the government to address any concerns.” The company said it had begun work on “a comprehensive plan” to protect European user data, including storing UK user data in its European datacentres and including third-party independent oversight of its approach. TikTok has acknowledged that UK personal data goes abroad, including to China, for its global staff to undertake certain “important functions”. Labour’s Angela Rayner accused the government of being “behind the curve with sticking plaster solutions” given the previously announced bans abroad – and asked why the “specific risk” only applied to central government phones and tablets. The party’s deputy leader also asked whether there had been “a root and branch review” of the use of mobile phones by ministers, referring to the feared hacking of Liz Truss’s phone when she was foreign secretary and Matt Hancock’s WhatsApp messages, which ended up in the hands of the Daily Telegraph. “Can he say if there were any discussions during this process about the use of private messaging such as WhatsApp and email by ministers?” Rayner asked MPs. Dowden replied saying that ministers received “extensive advice when they take office” and that the government was updating its guidance on private messaging by ministers. Iain Duncan Smith, a Conservative MP who has repeatedly raised security concerns about China, said ministers and officials’ personal phones also should be covered by a ban because “private phones will remain on their desks”. He added: “The point I’d make is you can’t stop there.” But in answer, Dowden said there was “a balance the government has to try to get right”. He said ministers were made aware of the rules that substantive government business should only be conducted on government devices.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/16/uk-bans-tiktok-from-government-mobile-phones
45,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-16,Afternoon Update: Albanese fires back at Keating over Aukus criticism; global banking fears; and US threatens to ban TikTok,"Good afternoon. The fallout from the Aukus submarine pact continues, with Malcolm Turnbull the latest former PM to criticise the deal. Turnbull questioned the merit of partnering with the UK given their economy faces “existential problems”. “You’ve got to ask yourself whether Britain is going to be able to sustain investment in its navy and its military in the years ahead,” he said. The high-profile rift among Labor figureheads rolls on, with Anthony Albanese saying he “fundamentally” disagreed with Paul Keating’s view, adding that Keating’s remarks yesterday at the National Press Club “diminish him”. Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency says it will insist on inspecting Australia’s future nuclear submarines to ensure no fissile material is diverted. Important reading: Keating attacked the Nine newspapers for what he called a “provocative” series warning of war with China. Nine Entertainment defended the series as an attempt to broaden the China debate in a manner independent of government. But was it truly independent, or merely echoes from a hawkish defence establishment eager to derail foreign affairs minister Penny Wong’s attempts to stabilise relations with China? The award-winning journalist Margaret Simons investigates. Top news Global banking fears | The Swiss central bank will loan embattled giant Credit Suisse $81.5bn a day after its share price plummeted to a record low. That wasn’t enough, however, to assuage fears of a broader crisis in the global banking sector. Asian stocks slid, as did shares in Australia’s big banks, which were down about 2% in early trading today. New Zealand recession? | The economy shrank 0.6% in the December quarter – larger than predicted by any of New Zealand’s major banks. Annually, GDP is still growing, up 2.4% year on year. If the downturn continues this quarter, it would mean New Zealand is about six months into a recession. To be considered “in recession”, the economy has to record negative GDP growth for two consecutive quarters. Unemployment rate falls | Australia’s economy added almost 65,000 jobs in February, more than economists expected, indicating hiring was holding up amid the record run of interest rate rises. The jobless rate fell to 3.5%, compared with January’s reported 3.7%. Bruce Lehrmann ‘millions’ text | Lehrmann (pictured) allegedly sent a text to his then girlfriend on 15 February 2021 that he could obtain millions in a defamation claim if he was named in the media, a court has heard. “If I’m named tonight, he says I’m up for millions as defamation,” the text read. Lehrmann, who was giving evidence in person today, explained that he was trying to placate his girlfriend. Lehrmann is seeking to sue Network Ten and News Corp over their reporting of Brittany Higgins’s allegations of rape two years ago, allegations which he has consistently and vehemently denied. Latitude cyber-attack | Consumer lender Latitude Financial has been hit by a “sophisticated and malicious cyber-attack” that has resulted in the theft of more than 100,000 identification documents and 225,000 customer records. The non-bank lender, which offers personal loans and credit to customers shopping at such stores as JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman, said in a statement that most of the identification documents were copies of driver’s licences. US threatens to ban TikTok | The Biden administration is reportedly threatening to ban the popular social platform unless its Chinese owners divest their stakes. It’s the latest and most dramatic move in a series of escalations driven by fears that US user data held by the company could be passed on to China’s government. Israel civil war warning | Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, says civil war “is within touching distance”. His comments come amid continued mass protests against the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s attempts to weaken the judiciary. Netanyahu has previously said overhauling the judiciary has nothing to do with his corruption trial.

46,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-15,UK expected to ban TikTok from government mobile phones ,"Britain is expected to announce a ban on the Chinese owned video-sharing app TikTok on government mobile phones imminently, bringing the UK inline with the US and European Commission and reflecting deteriorating relations with Beijing. The decision marks a sharp reverse from the UK’s previously relaxed position, but some critics and experts said Britain should also extend the ban to cover personal phones used by ministers and officials – and even consider a complete ban. An announcement is expected from the Cabinet Office potentially as soon as Thursday, sources said, and it follows an official review involving the government’s National Cyber Security Centre, an arm of GCHQ, and similar bans announced by the European Commission last month and the US in the past three weeks On Monday, prime minister, Rishi Sunak indicated he was considering whether to follow suit, saying he will take “whatever steps are necessary” to protect Britain’s security. The prime minister said the UK was “looking at what our allies are doing”, following initial reports that a ban would be recommended over the weekend. At least two cabinet ministers use TikTok. Michelle Donelan, the science and technology minister, and Grant Shapps, the energy security and net zero secretary, also has an account, on an app used by millions of young people and a string of celebrities and other influencers. Until recently, the UK had been relaxed about TikTok, with intelligence officials arguing that it was essentially for entertainment. Jeremy Fleming, the GCHQ boss, said last October said he would encourage young people to use TikTok, but said he would encourage them to “think about” how their personal data is used. Concerns appears to be centred on long-standing concerns about a 2017 national security law in China, which requires organisations and citizens to “support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work”. It has been cited in the past to justify bans on Huawei kit in UK and other 5G telecoms networks. TikTok said this week it would be “disappointed” if the UK banned the app on official phones. Referring to bans on official phones elsewhere it said: “Similar decisions … have been based on misplaced fears and seemingly driven by wider geopolitics, but we remain committed to working with the government to address any concerns.” Charles Parton, a China expert with 22 years of UK Foreign Office experience of working with the country, said he thought any ban should be extended to cover ministers and officials on their personal phones. “This all comes back to a lack of a security culture. In the days of the Soviet Union, there was general acknowledgment that some things had to be off limits. But China, although a bigger long-term threat to our security, economic prosperity, values and data, is not seen in the same light. It should be,” he added. This week the UK published its Integrated Review of defence and foreign policy, and marginally toughened its language on China, describing the country as posing an “epoch-defining challenge” – whilst declining to call it a threat as some, including Sunak’s predecessor Liz Truss, had sought. China’s embassy in London accused the UK of misunderstanding its intentions, arguing that “for all countries, China is an epoch-defining opportunity, not a challenge. China is committed to the path of peaceful development”. TikTok, ultimately owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is scrambling to convince lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic that it can address concerns about data security and access to its recommendation algorithm, which curates what its more than 1 billion users see on the app.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/15/uk-expected-to-ban-tiktok-from-government-mobile-phones
47,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-14,NSW government considers banning TikTok on all public sector devices,"The New South Wales government is considering banning public sector employees from using TikTok on work devices, engaging federal cybersecurity agencies for advice amid concerns over the social video app’s links to China. As the federal government considers the security of the app, the NSW electoral commission has confirmed software – including TikTok – is not permitted to be downloaded on to work mobile phones without prior approval. The state government does not yet have an overarching policy for the app’s download and use on department devices, but Guardian Australia understands that is now being reviewed. Currently NSW departments and agencies are allowed to decide their own course of action. Nearly half of all federal agencies have reportedly banned the app on government-owned devices in recent months, which has been criticised by the federal opposition for lacking a consistent and overarching response to the use of the app. The home affairs department will this month finalise a review for minister Clare O’Neil into the security risks of all social media platforms and the correct government settings. While privacy and security of data is a concern for all social media apps, the concern with TikTok and fellow China-based app WeChat has been for how data could be accessed under China’s national security law. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, this week indicated Britain could follow the US and Canada in banning the app from government devices, saying he would take “whatever steps are necessary” to protect security. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The NSW government has commenced talks with the Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre about the app, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance. “The NSW Government is aware of this issue and is currently working with the ACSC,” a government spokesperson said. “The NSW government does not have an overarching policy prohibiting TikTok from government devices. Each agency has social media guidelines and procedures in place to govern how social media apps are used on work-issued devices.” The state’s own agency – Cyber Security NSW – has advised all users to take security and privacy “into consideration” when downloading any app on to a corporate device. “Cyber Security NSW continually reviews guidance and develops products for NSW government entities on workplace systems and apps,” the spokesperson said. “Cyber Security NSW will maintain a vigilant approach to cyber security.” The NSW electoral commission would not provide “detailed public commentary” on its cybersecurity plans but confirmed employees were banned from downloading the app without explicit approval. The agency is working with Cyber Security NSW, the commonwealth’s electoral integrity assurance taskforce and the ACSC. NSW Labor’s digital spokesperson, Yasmin Catley, said the Coalition had “failed” to provide an overarching policy and vowed to fix it if Labor forms government in a fortnight. “A future NSW Labor government will work with our federal government counterparts in responding to any specific concerns,” she said. Associate professor in national security at the University of Canberra, Dr Michael Jensen, believed the federal review would probably lead to a ban on government devices in commonwealth departments, with limited exceptions, and the states would probably follow. “I think that they’ll generally look to what’s happening nationally,” he said. TikTok Australia’s general manager, Lee Hunter, said TikTok was not a Chinese company, insisting it was a “global” entity that stored the data of Aussie users in Singapore and the US. “The Chinese government cannot compel another sovereign nation to provide data stored in that nation’s territory,” he said. “We have, and will continue to, proactively engage with governments at all levels in areas of shared interest, and we are always available to answer questions they may have.”",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/14/nsw-government-considers-banning-tiktok-on-all-public-sector-devices
48,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-13,Rishi Sunak hints at TikTok ban from UK government devices,"Rishi Sunak has indicated that the UK could follow the US and Canada in banning TikTok from government devices, saying he will take “whatever steps are necessary” to protect Britain’s security. The prime minister said the UK was “looking at what our allies are doing” in the wake of the decision by other countries to remove TikTok from government phones amid fears over the social video app’s links to China. The European Commission and European parliament have also banned TikTok from staff devices. Asked by ITV if the government was considering a ban, Sunak said: “We want to make sure that we protect the integrity and security of sensitive information. And we will always do that and take whatever steps are necessary to make sure that happens.” In a further interview with the BBC, Sunak said: “We take security of our devices seriously.” Earlier on Monday, TikTok said it would be “disappointed” if it was banned from UK government devices, after it was reported that ministers were about to do so. TikTok said such moves were based on “misplaced fears”. The app is under pressure over its ownership by the Beijing-based ByteDance, with politicians on both sides of the Atlantic warning that the Chinese state could access its data or manipulate what people view on the app via its recommendation algorithm. The Sunday Times reported that a review of TikTok had been carried out by the government security group, a team within the Cabinet Office, and that the National Cyber Security Centre had identified security risks related to the app. A TikTok spokesperson said: “While we await details of any specific concerns the UK government may have, we would be disappointed by such a move. Similar decisions elsewhere have been based on misplaced fears and seemingly driven by wider geopolitics, but we remain committed to working with the government to address any concerns.” The report said the ban would not apply to the personal devices of ministers and civil servants, though advice would be issued to explain the risks of using the app. Hours before the Sunak interviews were broadcast, Downing Street had suggested no imminent changes were planned in the position on TikTok being installed on government phones. The prime minister’s deputy official spokesperson said: “There’s no change … All departments have robust processes in place to ensure that IT devices are secure, including managing risks from third-party applications.” Last week, TikTok gave further details of its plan to assuage the concerns of European governments about the security of the platform. Entitled Project Clover, the framework includes the storage of user data on servers in Ireland and Norway at an annual cost of €1.2bn (£1.1bn), with any data transfers outside Europe being vetted by a third-party IT company. The outlines of a security deal have been thrashed out in the US but the White House has not approved the arrangement, which includes the tech firm Oracle storing TikTok’s data and scrutinising its source code. The US banned TikTok from federal government devices in December, and Canada and the EU’s executive arm followed suit last month.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/13/tiktok-would-be-disappointed-if-uk-banned-app-on-official-devices
49,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-08,TikTok unveils European data security plan amid calls for US ban,"TikTok has announced a data security regime for protecting user information across Europe, as political pressure increases in the US to ban the social video app. The plan, known as Project Clover, involves user data being stored on servers in Ireland and Norway at an annual cost of €1.2bn (£1.1bn), while any data transfers outside Europe will be vetted by a third-party IT company. TikTok is under pressure in the US and Europe over its links to China via its Beijing-based parent, ByteDance. On Tuesday the White House gave its backing to a Senate bill that would give the administration the power to ban TikTok and on Wednesday the FBI director Christopher Wray told a Senate hearing that the app “screams” of national security concerns. TikTok, which stores its global user data in the US and Singapore, has denied its data or algorithms can be accessed or manipulated by the Chinese government. “The Chinese government have never asked us for data, and if they would we would refuse to do so,” said Theo Bertram, TikTok’s vice-president of government relations and public policy in Europe. TikTok, which has more than 1 billion users worldwide, has 150 million in Europe. TikTok had said it would store data in two servers in Ireland but announced on Wednesday that it would also use a datacentre in Norway for the same purpose under Project Clover. The use of the Irish and Norwegian data servers will cost TikTok €1.2bn a year. Under Clover, TikTok’s data controls and transfer of data outside of the continent will be monitored by a third-party European cybersecurity firm, although the company has yet to disclose the name of its security partner. TikTok said it would introduce “pseudonymisation” of personal data so an individual could not be identified without additional information. Last year TikTok confirmed employees outside the continent, including in China, could access user data to ensure their experience of the platform was “consistent, enjoyable and safe”. It said European user data could be used to conduct checks on the performance of its algorithms, which recommend content to users, and tracking vexatious automated accounts. TikTok’s European proposals mirror a plan to reassure the US about user data, called Project Texas. Under the US plan, TikTok will store data from American users in the US on servers run by the tech firm Oracle. Oracle will also monitor TikTok’s algorithms and source code – to try to assuage concerns that the Chinese state could influence what people see on the app – as well as vetting updates and delivering them to the Google and Apple app stores. However, the proposals have not received political sign-off from the White House, amid fresh tensions between Washington and Beijing over the shooting down of a Chinese spy balloon off the US east coast. TikTok’s credibility was also damaged last year when ByteDance admitted employees had attempted to use the app to spy on reporters. Concerns about TikTok’s data have been heightened by fears that companies could be legally compelled to hand over data by the Chinese government, citing examples such as China’s national intelligence law of 2017, which states that all organisations and citizens shall “support, assist and cooperate” with national intelligence efforts. Last month the European Commission, the EU’s executive body, banned TikTok from work phones and devices, while the European parliament has also banned the app from staff phones. However, the UK has ruled out similar moves despite lobbying from Conservative politicians, including the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith. Michelle Donelan, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, said last month there were no grounds for a ban. “We have no evidence to suggest there is a necessity to ban people from using TikTok. That would be a very, very forthright move … that would require a significant evidence base to be able to do that,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/08/tiktok-european-data-security-regime-us-ban-social-video-app
50,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-07,"TikTok bans on Australian government-issued phones should be extended to other apps, experts say","Federal department bans on using TikTok on Australian government-issued phones are sensible but should also apply to other social media apps, experts say. A growing number of Australian government agencies have begun banning the popular ByteDance app, amid security concerns over the company’s ties to China and which data might be accessible to the Chinese government about TikTok’s users. The Canberra Times reported that almost half of the nearly 140 federal government agencies canvassed had banned the app on government-owned devices. While most of the focus from the opposition has been on TikTok alone, the Department of Home Affairs is undertaking a review at the request of the home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, of the security risks of all social media platforms and the correct government settings. The report is due to be submitted in the first quarter of this year. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Experts say TikTok should not be the sole focus of bans from work devices. “I don’t think it’s as simple as TikTok – bad; American companies – good,” said Prof Vanessa Teague, a cybersecurity researcher at the Australian National University. “I think they’re all bad.” Teague said while Apple and Google now give users increasing powers to limit which information they provide to social media apps – such as location and contact information – the apps can and do still collect a wide array of information on users. “It’s all well and good to turn off location permission, but if you then upload a photo or a video that has your GPS coordinates … then you told them where you are, so it’s better but it doesn’t completely solve the problem.” Dr Abu Barkat Ullah, a cyber security associate professor at the University of Canberra, also warned of the risks of all apps. He said that while limiting which apps can be installed on work devices makes sense, people will still be providing a lot of information through their own personal devices. “We need to be very much careful about the personal devices, what data we are exposing to outsiders,” he said. A TikTok spokesperson told Guardian Australia on Monday the company was “not unique in how we operate”. “Some of the best-known and trusted Australian companies, including banks and telcos, openly state in their privacy policies that they share Australian user information with employees and third parties around the world, including China,” the spokesperson said. “These organisations often collect sensitive data like financial information, medical records, legal information and more. The TikTok app collects less data than many popular mobile apps.” The spokesperson added that the company would “continue to be diligent in ensuring we meet, or exceed, the data security standards applied to companies that operate in Australia”. In a submission in February to a Senate inquiry on foreign influence through social media, the company’s director of public policy in Australia and New Zealand, Ella Woods-Joyce, said the company should not be a political football. “We are proud of our heritage and it’s important to note that we operate no differently to other global companies and claims to the contrary are unsubstantiated by evidence,” she said. O’Neil has ruled out a wider ban on the app. “TikTok is one of the most widely used apps in Australia, much beloved by Australia’s young people in particular. It’s not currently on the table,” she told the ABC in February. The Liberal, Labor and Greens parties, as well as Pauline Hanson and Bob Katter, are all active on the app. One of the most prominent federal MPs on the app, Labor’s Julian Hill, has said he does not use the app on his government-issued phone. Teague and Ullah said the focus should be on educating Australians about privacy beyond TikTok, not just whether one app should be banned. “Sometimes I say are we driving without seatbelts because everybody is using without knowing the challenges that lie behind [it],” Ullah said. “I don’t actually think they’re really solving the problem, unless they’re solving the problem of Australians’ privacy and security, which would mean strong privacy laws, better education, encouragement of end-to-end encryption and an end to this nonsense that encryption is only for paedophiles,” Teague said. “They actually have to change their whole direction and start encouraging people to use technologies that secure our data.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/07/tiktok-bans-on-australian-government-issued-phones-should-be-extended-to-other-apps-experts-say
51,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-05,Heads warn parents not to back pupil protests spreading via TikTok,"The TikTok videos show pupils throwing bins, tables and even urine. Across England and Wales, a handful of schools have been hit by protests against rules such as banning trips to the toilet during lessons or regulations against rolled up skirts. Schools admit they are extremely worried about the copycat protests that have erupted in the last two weeks, typically sparked by videos shared on TikTok with many thousands of views. But what has shocked many leaders most is the number of parents on social media applauding pupils taking part. Headteachers told the Observer this weekend that parents were wrong to praise students who “stampeded” through schools, insisting school leaders have every right to use unpopular new rules to deal with behaviour such as vaping and bullying in toilets. Sam Strickland, principal of Duston school, an academy in Northampton that teaches children aged four to 19, told the Observer: “Some parents have been arguing that it is an infringement of human rights for schools to restrict toilet use during lessons. That’s ludicrous.” He argues that parents are “legitimising” demonstrations that could quickly get out of hand and become a serious risk to young people’s safety, by openly questioning the fairness of school rules and the authority of teachers. He had a tipoff last weekend that some of his pupils were planning a protest, in part about the school telling pupils they could only use the toilet at break time. He said he decided “to take the bull by the horns”, confronting each of the secondary school year groups as they lined up in the playground first thing on Monday morning. “I looked at them and said: ‘I know about this. Don’t do this.’ I said we would either suspend or potentially permanently exclude anyone who took part in a protest,” he said. He reminded them that there were better channels through which to address their concerns, such as the student council or talking to their form teacher. The protest never materialised, but he thinks all schools are worried about the social media trend catching on. “It is a fundamental safeguarding risk,” he said. “There is nothing healthy about 200 kids stampeding through a school protesting. If it all goes wrong you also risk a safeguarding inspection visit from Ofsted. It’s serious.” However, he is unapologetic about toilet regulations, pointing out that it is hugely disruptive if teachers are interrupted “every two minutes” by someone asking to go to the loo, and that schools are trying to rein in problems with bullying, vaping and drug use in unsupervised toilets. “When I was a kid you worried about getting your head flushed down the toilet at school. Now vaping is the big problem,” he said. “The difference is that schools are now taking control of these issues.” Chris Stokes, principal of Farnley Academy in Leeds, wrote to parents on 24 February condemning a protest at his school that morning over locked toilets during lessons. A parent told the local newspaper the school was infringing young people’s human rights. Others backed her up on social media. But Stokes said in his letter that the decision to lock toilets had followed “two very serious safeguarding events”. He wrote: “It was a necessary decision to keep all pupils safe.” A school leader in the north of England told the Observer many schools are focusing on preventing bullying in toilets. “We are looking at classic places like stairwells and toilets and PE changing rooms and putting things in place to make children safer.” To this end, the school, like a number of others, has taken the entry doors off its toilet blocks, which were being used for bullying and vaping. The school had heard rumours about a protest a week ago, but managed to head it off. The school leader insists they are not trying to suppress young people’s views. “Our job is to keep students safe. Some parents have been praising children on social media for protesting, but they aren’t appreciating the risks and how quickly these situations can escalate.” Many schools have found themselves at the sharp end of such escalation. At Neale-Wade Academy in Fenland, reports on social media of a protest on 27 February referred to pupils throwing urine and bins. Principal Graham Horn had tried to prevent the protest about toilet restrictions by emailing parents asking them to encourage their children to have “sensible conversations”, but this didn’t work. Penrice Academy in St Austell, Cornwall, confirmed last week it would expel some pupils after reports of protesters flipping tables and climbing fences. Meanwhile, Kent’s largest secondary school, Homewood school in Tenterden, had to call in the police to control a protest last Monday. In the local media, some parents were praising students for making their voices heard, but one said her daughter had told her some pupils were being sick because they were so anxious. A mother whose teenage daughter attends a large secondary school in the east of England told the Observer her daughter had opted out of a protest about locked toilets after they discussed it at home. Her daughter sheltered in a classroom for two hours with a few others while the protest was under way, but said more than half the school took part. The mother, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “Frankly, they’re kids, and these aren’t organised protests, but impulsive ones. Thanks to group psychology, they can turn real quick.” She said she understood why the school was taking action, after an expensive new block had been “totally trashed”, but she disagreed with banning their use outside break time. “It’s really irresponsible to deny toilets to girls who are just starting their periods,” she said. Charlotte Haines Lyon, senior lecturer in education at York St John University, said: “Schools are on their knees with no resources, so I absolutely understand why teachers would go and lock toilets to tackle problems.” But she recently surveyed nearly 200 parents about the school toilets debate and more than half of them reported that their child had avoided drinking so they would not need the toilet at school. “One respondent said that if her child needed to use the toilet in lesson time, she had to get toilet paper from the office. Can you imagine how humiliating that would be?” she said. “And what about girls trying to get their heads around periods? Restricting toilets is just adding more pressure.” Thomas Michael, deputy safeguarding lead at a school in the West Midlands, said schools needed to make sure they explained the reasons behind changes to rules like these. But he said: “In some schools, toilets are a dangerous place. Bullying, fighting, buying and selling drugs – it all takes place there and staff can’t really monitor it, so you can understand their actions.” He added: “When you see people outside of education labelling this child abuse, it really hits those staff in tough schools who are trying to do right by all their pupils.” Will Teece, head of Brookvale Groby Learning Campus, a secondary academy in Leicester, said no one should be lauding students for rioting and damaging property: “Yes, it’s really important to listen to students’ concerns, but adults are the ones in charge.” There has been talk of a protest at Teece’s school, but nothing has happened yet. He has written to parents, and planned an assembly to discuss concerns, but said even doing that felt risky. “If something is posted and shared and liked on TikTok, does that mean it’s real?” he said. “There is a fear that by communicating about it you might fuel something that might never have taken off.”",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/mar/05/heads-uk-parents-pupil-protests-tiktok-stampedes-teachers-social-media
52,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-05,"KSI, Logan Paul, Salt Papi: the influencers redefining boxing for the TikTok generation","Salt Papi, real name Busta Breezie, is a 28-year-old with slick dance moves, a pencil moustache and a mean left hook. He was born in the Philippines, moved to the UK as a teenager, and won fame – and a stage name – with his TikTok videos that parody Salt Bae, the celebrity Turkish chef known for ostentatiously sprinkling salt over meals. That, and videos in which he pretends to be running in slow motion. Papi used to be the “chubby” kid at school – fast food was his jam. Now he’s licking his lips as he dances around a boxing ring in Wembley Arena with Josh Brueckner, a YouTuber and MMA fighter with a cut-glass jaw and abs coming out of his ears. It’s not boxing as you know it, but Wembley Arena is packed – 10,000 people on the edge of their seats. We’re midway through an undercard that features a string of match-ups between vloggers, TikTok stars, Love Island-ers and OnlyFans creators. It will culminate in a headline bout between KSI, the 29-year-old rapper, YouTuber and co-owner of the energy drink Prime, and FaZe Temperrr, a pro Call of Duty player and co-owner of one of the world’s biggest esports organisations, FaZe Clan. “Watch it,” KSI told me in the days leading up to the fight, acknowledging the anarchy of the operation, “It’s all over the place.” Beyond the venue, 300,000 people on either side of the Atlantic are doing just that, having paid to tune into the action from their homes. Many more, I imagine, are watching via unofficial channels. And what’s not to like? Ripped internet celebs! Viral violence! Social-media spats! Knockouts! If you were going to bottle late 2010s to roaring-20s culture and send it to space so that aliens could understand the vibes, this is what you’d put in the bottle. It’s the strangest concoction of what could vaguely pass as family entertainment currently streaming to a teenager near you. You don’t need John Prescott to tell you that everyone loves to see public figures swing punches, and celebrity boxing – in the organised sense – has been around for decades. In the past these fixtures haven’t made the easiest viewing. When Fox aired Celebrity Boxing, in 2002, the pairings were bleak. Tonya Harding, the disgraced figure skater, was pitched against Paula Jones, a civil servant known for suing Bill Clinton for sexual harassment. Season two (two!) sunk television programming to the depths of the Mariana Trench with a fight between Joey Buttafuoco, a tabloid villain from Long Island who had been convicted for statutory rape and shooting his wife, and Chyna, a female professional wrestler. Buttafuoco won, and used the platform to say he’d been screwed by the legal system. There was truly nothing to feel good about. A string of charity and exhibition matches followed. Millions watched Ricky Gervais fight Grant Bovey, which Frank Warren, the boxing promoter, said made a farce of this “noble art”. After outrage from the British Board of Boxing, future fights in the series were cancelled. Subsequent events involving celebs were pretty shallow: flash-in-the-pan pop culture moments you’d soon forget had ever happened (or wish hadn’t). But this new incarnation of celebrity boxing, drawing on the vast pool of internet stars, is coalescing into something more sustained. And, strangely, genuinely watchable. It started in 2018. Simmering internet beef between KSI, real name Olajide “JJ” Olatunji, and another British YouTuber, Joe Weller, boiled over into an organised bout that was streamed by millions. After his victory, KSI took the opportunity to call out two of the world’s biggest internet celebrities – Jake and Logan Paul, the fair-haired bros from Ohio with a vast following (and a long list of controversies to their name). They were game. As Jake would later tell the New Yorker: “One thing that is great about being a fighter is, like, you can’t get cancelled.” A few months later an amateur fight was held at Manchester Arena. KSI faced Logan Paul (it was a draw) and KSI’s brother, Deji, took on Jake (who won). It was touted as the “biggest internet event in history” and drew the eyes of millions, including those of Eddie Hearn, who leapt in to set up a professional fight for the pair at the Staples Center in Los Angeles the following year. It was a roaring success, delighting as many viewers as it provoked, unlocking with it a Pandora’s box of debate that swaggers jauntily around the influencer boxing scene to this day. Is it legitimate boxing? Is proper boxing boring? What even is “proper” boxing? To those involved, mere tittle tattle. Two million people paid to view the fight, millions more streamed it illegally. It pulled in an estimated £150m. Ding, ding, ding. In the years since, YouTuber, influencer or crossover boxing, whatever you choose to call it, has grown in stature, with more fights and more fans. It has become increasingly difficult to ignore, even for the most ignorant (and by that, I mean, most people over the age of 30). The audience at Wembley Arena boasts a uniquely broad spectrum of stars, some of whom I would look straight through were it not for Brent Jennings, a 24-year-old student from London, sitting next to me. He’s been tuned into these guys for years, paid £400 for a ringside seat and tells me it’s money well spent. For starters, Jennings is pumped to be mere feet away from Danny Aarons, a 20-year-old Fifa streamer with half a million subscribers on YouTube and Twitch, quietly seated in the row ahead. Jennings’s younger brother watches this guy “for breakfast, lunch and dinner”, I’m told. He flicks open his phone to show me Aaron’s YouTube page. “Mad!” He asks Aarons for a selfie. Shortly after, Aarons leans forward to ask for a selfie with the woman in front of him. It’s Holly Willoughby. She obliges. On the other side of the ring (beyond a smattering of Love Island-ers, KSI’s YouTube crew the Sidemen and members of FaZe Clan) is Louis Theroux. Krishnan Guru-Murthy is also there with his children. So is Katie Price. There’s boxing royalty, like Michael Buffer, in a paisley tux, here to announce the headline billing; Derek Chisora, in shades and a beanie. Rappers like Jme and AJ Tracey. Vape smoke wafts in from behind me where a group of friends converse in a huddle: “I swear that guy used to review chicken wings.” They peer down the aisle: it’s Elijah Quashie (the Chicken Connoisseur) best known for his YouTube series, the Pengest Munch. Who isn’t here? Up by the bar, Brian Michael Hinds, AKA the Bottom G, AKA the Gay Andrew Tate – who went viral last summer for performing a mocking TikTok dance of his controversial doppelganger – is having a dance-off with a bloke who also seems to be cosplaying as Tate with the help of a prosthetic scalp and a pair of aviators. Everybody gathers round to cheer, phones out, filming. Celebrity, clearly, is evolving, but celebrity boxing is evolving, too. What was once a degrading spectacle is now a (sort of) serious sport. As the players throw themselves into training camps, the quality of the scraps has sharpened. Jake Paul, in particular, has gained notoriety as a credible fighter (even Logan lasted the full eight rounds in an exhibition match with Floyd Mayweather Jr). The transatlantic rivalry between Jake Paul and KSI, household names who both remain undefeated, provides an enticing narrative engine with which to drum up attention for all involved. KSI v Jake Paul is touted to take place later this year. If previous fights have lit up the internet, this one will probably break it. In the meantime, KSI is at the heart of those hoping to build something bigger than his imminent grand duel. In 2021, Misfits Boxing was launched. It’s a collaboration between KSI’s management company, Proper Loud, and boxing promoters the Sauerland Brothers (now under the fold of Wasserman Boxing). The fights – featuring an expanding roster of creators to porn stars, rappers to MMA fighters – have been raucous, even if the boxing itself is questionable. In January, after a string of successful pay-per-view events, Misfits and DAZN, the streaming platform, announced a five-year exclusivity deal. The people with the purse strings seem to think they are on to something. Could influencer boxing be here to stay? Three days before the fight, KSI is leaning back in his chair, dressed in a gleaming white suit with a pink pocket square and a chain around his neck. The two of us are in a small room in Wembley Boxpark, where a press conference is due to be held as part of the promotional buildup. He exudes calm and focus – this past week has been pretty chill, I’m told. Watching TV, playing video games, shooting some content. None of the pre-fight nerves he used to get. “It helps when you train hard,” says KSI. “I’ve done about 111 rounds of boxing… not even light work… where they’re trying to knock my head off… and I’m surviving and holding my own.” The commitment among the fighters is commendable (Jake Paul trains at night to acclimatise himself to fight schedules). But people aren’t watching because they expect something balletic, right? “I’m not trying to compete with traditional boxing,” says KSI, as a young guy in a hoodie sneaks in behind him and leaves clutching bottles of Prime. “This is about who can be the most entertaining. Who can talk the talk and walk the walk, and be entertaining along the way. And that’s why people are so obsessed with it.” The rivalries in this rolling soap opera can seem artificial – Jake Paul may be KSI’s arch nemesis, but it hasn’t stopped him partnering with Logan to launch Prime – but what’s wrong with a bit of theatre? Pro wrestling, such as WWE, is completely scripted, but has absolute buy-in from its audience. The “realness” is irrelevant. In that sense, Misfits seems to be built on an understanding that the best sporting events are not simply about who is the best physically, but about the storytelling and characters behind it. As KSI puts it: “We want to be the WWE of boxing.” The press conference commences and the stars of the Misfits universe vie for attention. Each has their own narrative, each moulded to fit an archetype (though arguably the one archetype they all fit is “creator”). There’s Elle Brooke, a TikTok and OnlyFans star from Surrey, sauntering around in a tiara and “Birthday Girl” sash. Anthony “Pretty Boy” Taylor, an MMA fighter from California with a pencil moustache and red velvet smoking jacket. Ryan Taylor, a pro BMX rider from Walsall, lumbering about in a white furry bucket hat shouting back at taunts. On stage, each takes their turn to square up, shout profanities, call out new names for fights and blow out their 15 minutes of fame. When KSI and FaZe Temperrr take to the stage, Anthony Taylor interrupts from the balcony. “What about me?” he yells, waving a bottle of Prime. “What about me?!” Cheering and jeering is a throng of fans in Dragon Ball Z hoodies, Drew House sweatshirts and 50 shades of North Face jacket. There is also a junket of vloggers, part of the self-sustaining media ecosystem fuelling the sport. These are largely fronted by teenagers, some of whom get more privileged access than the mainstream press. Like Fox Townley, who goes by the handle FoxTheG, a lean 17-year-old with long blond hair and a baseball cap with his moniker on it. He was actually flown over from the US by Misfits to film content around the fight, he tells me, and is there with his mum, Avian Townley, 48, who looks a little out of place in her red-checked shirt and Kanken rucksack. “I do not understand about 85% of what the hell is happening,” she says. “But I’m very proud.” The following morning, the cast arrives for weigh-in. Cue more showboating and a stage invasion by Likkleman, a 3ft-tall fighter with half a million Instagram followers. Enjoying the spectacle are Kalle Sauerland and Mams Taylor, a pop producer and owner of Proper Loud, who was raised on a diet of WWE. The duo – dressed in Misfits brand tracksuit – are bridging the two worlds. “Let’s not beat around the bush,” says Sauerland, who ducks and dives like he’s dodging punches when he talks. “It draws numbers that very few entertainment sport segments could dream of reaching.” Now he’s getting calls from all sorts: “mainstream celebrities, footballers, athletes, actors, actresses…” Taylor chips in: “People you’d never dream of… I can’t even tell you.” So what’s changed? What makes this so desirable while celebrity boxing in the past has been associated with Z-listers chasing cash? “This rabid fanbase” says Taylor. “If you connect with those kids, they’ll buy your products. They’ll watch your TV show. They’ll follow you.” He looks at me from under his black cowboy hat, through a pair of blacked-out shades printed with the Louis Vuitton logo. “The uncool has become cool.” Those representing the established sport have their reservations. Last year Jake Wood, the EastEnders actor and co-host of the Pound for Pound boxing podcast, tweeted that YouTuber boxing “undermines what professional boxers and boxing stands for”. Others have taken offence at influencers calling out professionals for a fight. “Know your limit,” Carl Frampton, a former pro boxer, said on the William Hill Stripped podcast. But increasingly, there’s a muted respect. “It’s not boxing, it’s barely even fighting in some cases,” wrote Matt Christie in Boxing News. “But when the fans – those who pay – are happy and not constantly moaning about everything being a waste of money, then ‘celebrity boxing’ is doing something that ‘real boxing’ is not.” Andy Clarke, a boxing commentator who was covering the fight at Wembley for talkSPORT, told me that it used to make him uncomfortable. “I worried that if someone suffered an injury, proper boxing would carry the can for it,” he said. “But as long as they are trying to make it as safe as possible, just as they do with pro boxing, amateur boxing, white-collar boxing – which happens up and down the country every weekend – then you can’t ask for too much more than that.” Besides, says Clarke, since Misfits was set up, it has forged its own identity and community: “It just exists in its own crazy bubble.” Finally, fight night. In the warren of corridors and dressing rooms behind Wembley Arena, the fighters prep for their moment. Glove up. Flurry about for a last moment of shadow boxing. Out on the streets a queue snakes from the building. There are men in sharp suits, women in stilettos, but between the glitz are awkward kids chasing their dads, and teenagers making their first trip to London. Sauerland was right. Unlike the usual boxing match, people really do show up early for the undercards. From 7pm the stadium is energised, though the age of the audience skews far younger than your usual boxing crowd. Some fights are forgettable, others magnetic. KSI, as promised, wins his fight against FaZe Temperrr after an impressive first-round knockout. But by then it’s clear that other fighters are rising up – in this strange new sporting universe, at least – with unexpected talent and unmistakable star quality. That, undeniably, comes from Salt Papi. He showboats his way through his first round with Josh Brueckner, dropping his arms to hop a playful toe-to-toe jig before sharing a smile with the crowd. He has their undivided attention. Moments into round two, and it’s all over; Papi’s southpaw sends Brueckner to the deck. He slices a finger across his throat, raises his gloves in victory and swaggers back to his corner to return his wire-framed spectacles to his nose. Not for the first time that evening, Jennings leaps out of his seat, waving his phone in the air. “Salt Papi, he’s the killer!” It’s not that he doesn’t love “proper” boxing too, it’s just that this has an extra layer to it. Following the stars as they train, watching their journey, their physical transformation, their beef, their banter, is a big part of it. Salt Papi, the chubby kid from school, the TikTok jester… now he’s winning praise from the likes of Chris Eubank Jr. Even Eddie Hearn is tempted. “I want to turn Salt Papi pro,” he said recently. “He’s a man of the people.” It’s a fable for our time.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/05/fight-for-your-likes-the-rise-of-the-youtube-boxers
53,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-03,TikTok ‘acting too slow’ to tackle self-harm and eating disorder content,"TikTok has been urged to strengthen its content moderation policies around suicide and eating disorder material by organisations including the NSPCC and the Molly Rose Foundation. The groups claimed TikTok had not acted swiftly enough following the publication of research suggesting the app’s recommendation algorithm pushes self-harm and eating disorder content to teenagers within minutes of them expressing interest in the topics. In a letter to TikTok’s head of safety, the organisations asked the app to take “meaningful action” including: improving moderation of eating disorder and suicide content; working with experts to develop a “comprehensive” approach to removing harmful content; supporting users who may be struggling with eating disorders or suicidal thoughts; and regular reporting on the steps being taken to address those issues. The signatories, more than two dozen organisations that also include the American Psychological Association and the US Eating Disorders Coalition, claim TikTok has removed just seven of the 56 coded eating disorder hashtags highlighted in research published in December by the campaign group the Center for Countering Digital Hate. CCDH said there had been 1.6bn further views of those hashtags since November last year. “Since CCDH’s report was released in December 2022, you have chosen to deny the problem, deflect responsibility, and delay taking any meaningful action,” said the groups in a letter to the TikTok safety boss, Eric Han. Responding to the CCDH report last year, TikTok said the research, which used fake accounts that dwelt on videos about body image, eating disorders and mental health in order to test the responsiveness of the app’s recommendation algorithm, did not reflect the experience or viewing habits of its real-life users. The letter was disclosed in the same week that TikTok, which has more than 1 billion users worldwide, said it would limit teenagers joining the app to an hour of use each day. However, the restriction can be changed or removed in the app’s settings. A spokesperson for TikTok said many people who struggled with, or were recovering from, eating disorders used the app for support. “Our community guidelines are clear that we do not allow the promotion, normalisation or glorification of eating disorders, and we have removed content mentioned in this report that violates these rules. We are open to feedback and scrutiny, and we seek to engage constructively with partners who have expertise on these complex issues, as we do with NGOs in the US and UK,” said the spokesperson. In the UK, the youth suicide charity Papyrus can be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or email pat@papyrus-uk.org. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

54,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-03,‘Spy balloon in your phone’: growing calls to ban TikTok threaten its future,"The Chinese spy balloon that hovered over the US last month did not just damage relations between Beijing and Washington, it also cast a shadow over the future of TikTok. Last week, a US congressional committee backed legislation that would give the US president the power to ban the Chinese-owned social video app. The Republican chair of the committee, Michael McCaul, said the incident had reinforced fears of Chinese state surveillance, describing TikTok as a “spy balloon in your phone”. It came days after Canada announced it would join the US in barring TikTok from government mobile devices because of security concerns. The EU’s executive arm and the European parliament have also banned the app from staff phones. TikTok faces the threat of these narrow bans escalating. Banning the app entirely would leave a big gap in the social media consumption of the US alone, where TikTok has more than 100 million users. Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, was ambivalent about going further. “This may be the first step, this may be the only step we need to take,” he said. McCaul’s bill has some way to go before becoming law, requiring approval by both legislative bodies in Congress before reaching Joe Biden, but it joins other pieces of legislation with similar aims. In the Senate, the Republican Josh Hawley has introduced an act to ban TikTok nationwide, while fellow Republican senator Marco Rubio is behind similar legislation. The US ban of TikTok on federal devices adds to similar measures by a host of states including Texas, South Dakota and Virginia that prohibited state employees from using the app on their government-issued devices. Free speech groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) are on alert as efforts to ban TikTok progress, arguing it would violate first amendment rights. McCaul’s bill, which moved more quickly than the ACLU anticipated, is also overly broad and would impose sanctions on any company that may be directly or indirectly “subject to the influence of China”, according to the ACLU senior policy counsel, Jenna Leventoff. That could “loop in a lot of companies outside of TikTok”, she said. It is unclear how a US-wide ban on TikTok would be implemented and the bill provides few guidelines or limitations. “It means that they can do whatever they think they need to do to prevent citizens from engaging with a company that meets the relevant criteria,” Leventoff said. The text of McCaul’s bill quotes Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, who warns that TikTok’s parent is “controlled by the Chinese government”. He said the Chinese state can influence people by manipulating the algorithm that curates what people view on TikTok, as well as giving the government the opportunity to collect user data for “traditional espionage operations”. TikTok has denied that its data, or algorithm, is accessed by the Chinese state. Last year it was reported that the US tech firm Oracle had begun auditing TikTok’s algorithms and content moderation models to ensure they were not being manipulated by Chinese authorities. Despite longstanding scepticism about TikTok’s independence from the Chinese state, no hard evidence has been produced to prove there has been state access to its user data or the app’s algorithm. However, TikTok’s credibility was damaged last year when its parent company, ByteDance, admitted employees had attempted to use the app to spy on reporters as part of a leak investigation. Four staff members were fired as a result. But Leventoff argues the collection and sharing of user data is not just a TikTok problem; it is an industry-wide problem and one that requires an industry-wide solution such as a federal data privacy law, which the US does not currently have. The committee vote and phone bans have taken place against the backdrop of an investigation into TikTok by the committee on foreign investment in the US [CFIUS], which reviews investments by foreign entities in US businesses. TikTok believes it had an outline deal in place with CFIUS. Its key components are: TikTok will store data from American users in the US on servers run by Oracle; Oracle will monitor TikTok’s algorithms and source code; Oracle will vet app updates and deliver them to the Google and Apple app stores; and TikTok will create a board of security experts that will oversee its US operations and report to the US government. A TikTok spokesperson said: “We are two years and $1.5bn [£1.25bn] deep into a project to go above and beyond existing law to secure the US version of the TikTok platform. The swiftest and most thorough way to address national security concerns is for CFIUS to adopt the proposed agreement that we worked with them on for nearly two years.” However, the process appears to be in limbo as it awaits signoff from the White House, in the shadow of a surveillance balloon. “The Oracle deal would mitigate any risk and would work, but it’s got an uphill battle to win political acceptance,” said James Lewis, a senior vice-president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a US thinktank. In the UK, the director of the spy agency GCHQ, Jeremy Fleming, said last year he would not be concerned if his children used TikTok. However, a group of Conservative politicians, including the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith MP, have urged Downing Street and senior ministers to shut down their TikTok accounts after parliament closed its own account in August last year following a lobbying campaign. Duncan Smith said TikTok should be banned on government devices and ministers’ personal telephones because the app is a “threat” and a “data harvester”. Citing China’s national intelligence law of 2017, which states that all organisations and citizens must cooperate with national intelligence efforts, he added: “Chinese companies must support the Chinese intelligence services whenever required.” However, a UK ban has been ruled out by Michelle Donelan, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology. Speaking to Politico this week, she said: “We have no evidence to suggest that there is a necessity to ban people from using TikTok. That would be a very, very forthright move … that would require a significant evidence base to be able to do that.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/03/spy-balloon-phone-growing-calls-ban-tiktok-threaten-future
55,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-01,House committee advances legislation to ban TikTok over security concerns,"A powerful US House committee has applied further pressure to TikTok by backing legislation that could give Joe Biden the power to ban the social video app. The House foreign affairs committee voted on Wednesday along party lines to grant the administration new powers to ban the Chinese-owned app as well as other apps believed to pose security risks. The fate of the measure is still uncertain and it would need to be passed by the full House and Senate before it can go to Biden. The Republican committee chair, Michael McCaul, described TikTok this week as a “spy balloon in your phone”, referring to the Chinese surveillance balloon that was shot down off the coast of South Carolina last month. Democrats on the committee voted against McCaul’s deterring America’s technological adversaries act but Republican lawmakers pushed it through 24 to 16. The committee vote came in the same week that Canada joined the US in banning TikTok from being installed on all government-issued mobile devices, due to security concerns. The European Commission has also banned TikTok from staff phones. Politicians who support the TikTok bans have expressed concerns that the Chinese government could access user data or manipulate public opinion via the app – accusations that TikTok denies. On Monday the British government said there was no evidence of the need for a TikTok ban. “We have no evidence to suggest that there is a necessity to ban people from using TikTok,” the UK’s secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, Michelle Donelan, told Politico. “That would be a very, very forthright move, that would require a significant evidence base to be able to do that.” McCaul told Reuters after the vote that he thinks the TikTok bill will be taken up on the floor “fairly soon” and voted on by the full House this month. He said this week that Democrats would prefer to rely on a security review of TikTok being undertaken by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, although an approved plan has yet to emerge from that process. Representative Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House foreign affairs committee, said he opposed the legislation because it would “damage our allegiances across the globe, bring more companies into China’s sphere, destroy jobs here in the United States and undercut core American values of free speech and free enterprise”. TikTok has around 110 million users in the US, according to analytics firm data.ai, and more than 1 billion worldwide. In a letter sent to McCaul this week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) warned that the legislation was “vague and overbroad” and would “violate the First Amendment rights of millions of Americans who use TikTok to communicate, gather information, and express themselves daily”. TikTok, which is owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, said it was “disappointed” to see the legislation being brought forward. “A US ban on TikTok is a ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion-plus people who use our service worldwide. We’re disappointed to see this rushed piece of legislation move forward, despite its considerable negative impact on the free speech rights of millions of Americans who use and love TikTok,” said a TikTok spokesperson. On Tuesday a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said banning TikTok on US government devices revealed Washington’s own insecurities and was an abuse of state power.

56,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-01,Under-18 TikTok users to be limited to one hour – until they change settings,"Teenagers joining TikTok will be limited to an hour of use each day, the social media company has announced – but only for as long as it takes them to realise they can change the settings manually. New default screen time restrictions will be enabled for every account known to belong to someone under 18, the company says. After the first hour’s use each day, the app will warn them their time is up, “so it’s easier to log off”. But parents praying for an intervention – or young people struggling with their own compulsive behaviour – might find the relief is shortlived, since the restriction can be altered or removed altogether in the app’s settings. If the user removes the limit and then goes on to use the app for more than 100 minutes a day, it will prompt them to set a new restriction, which TikTok says will at least require them to make an active decision on their continued usage. Parents wanting restrictions that cannot be overridden can make use of the app’s “family pairing” features, allowing them to link their own TikTok account to their child’s. These have been updated to allow a more rigorous restriction to be set. With a family pairing account, parents can set a custom screen-time limit for their children that cannot be overridden. They can also set a custom schedule to mute notifications, ensuring their children are not disturbed late at night. “While there’s no collectively endorsed position on how much screen time is ‘too much’, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we recognise that teens typically require extra support as they start to explore the online world independently,” said Cormac Keenan, the company’s head of trust and safety. “Research also shows that being more aware of how we spend our time can help us be more intentional about the decisions we make, and this is especially important but typically more difficult for younger audiences.” Social networks have a strong motivation to offer their own screen-time controls, in case people decide to activate the stricter controls built into both the iOS and Android smartphone platforms. New requirements introduced in 2021 require technology companies to be more aware of how their services are used by children. On Wednesday, the first formal complaint against a major tech company was levied under these rules, with a father-of-three alleging that YouTube was improperly harvesting data from under-13s.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/01/under-18-tiktok-users-to-be-limited-to-one-hour-until-they-change-settings
57,tiktok,Guardian,2023-03-01,Afternoon Update: ‘Worst of inflation behind us’; China angry over TikTok bans; and why you should walk 11 minutes a day,"The economy is losing steam, inflation is beginning to ease and unemployment is up – three trends the Reserve Bank wants to see as it considers a 10th consecutive hike to interest rates. Australia’s GDP grew 0.5% in the December quarter, slower than the 0.8% tipped by economists, while inflation in January was 7.4% – down from 8.4% in December and short of the 8.1% predicted by economists. Unemployment also rose in January from 3.5% to 3.7%. “I’m confident the worst of inflation is behind us rather than ahead of us,” the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said. Will it be enough to convince the RBA not to raise interest rates next week? Probably not, according to our economics correspondent, Peter Hannam, who said: “The RBA remains an odds-on favourite to lift its key interest rate when its board meets next Tuesday. At its February rates meeting, the RBA made it clear more interest rate rises were in the works and it would be require an abrupt change of course for them to avert a 10th rate rise in a row next week.” Top news Rajwinder Singh lands in Australia | The man suspected of murdering Cairns woman Toyah Cordingley in 2018 touched down at Melbourne airport today, escorted by Queensland police officers.

58,tiktok,Guardian,2023-02-24,Rishi Sunak faces calls to ban TikTok use by government officials,"Rishi Sunak has been urged to ban government officials from using TikTok in line with moves by the EU and US, amid growing cybersecurity fears over China. Officials in Europe and the US have been told to limit the use of the Chinese-owned social video app over concerns that data can be accessed by Beijing. This week the European Commission decided to suspend the use of TikTok on devices issued to staff and even personal phones if they have official apps installed, following Washington’s ban last year on federal employees using the app on work devices. However, the prime minister is currently resisting pressure to bar parliamentary staff and MPs from using TikTok, which has become increasingly popular among UK politicians. A No 10 spokesperson said he was “not aware” of any ban on Downing Street staff using the platform. “We [No 10] have got a TikTok account, but I don’t think we’ve put anything on it for a little while now,” he said. “It’s for individual departments and ministers to choose which social media platforms they want to use.” On Thursday, the Conservative MP Luke Evans posted a 48-second video on the app, showing his 41,000-strong following what it is like going through security to get into No 10. Alicia Kearns, the chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, told the Guardian: “We’ve now seen both the EU and US take decisive action on TikTok over security concerns: the acquisition of our personal data by a hostile state. We run the risk of becoming a tech security laggard amongst free and open nations. “The government needs to reconsider its policies and move to ban government officials and parliamentary staff from installing the app on any mobile phones utilised for work. We need an informed discussion across our country, including with our children, about the importance of our data and all it can reveal about us, and how it can make us vulnerable.” Tim Loughton, the Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, urged the prime minister to take “concerted action” against Chinese state threats. He said TikTok was in effect a “mega state-affiliated data harvesting organisation” that the UK should not deal with on an equivalent basis to other western multinational companies. The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith added: “Even when their western security operatives show that TikTok poses a security risk to us in the UK, we seem to drag our feet, trying not to take action that might upset China. “The prime minister has an opportunity to take control of China policy and it’s a critical time to do so. I hope the government owns up to the danger China poses and takes action immediately on TikTok.” Last year, parliament’s TikTok account was shut down after Kearns and a number of Conservative MPs raised concerns on the firm’s links to China. A letter last summer from Duncan Smith, the foreign affairs select committee chair, Tom Tugendhat, and the 1922 Committee vice-chair Nus Ghani claimed that “data security risks associated with the app are considerable”. The former health secretary and reality TV contestant Matt Hancock is a regular user, while the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, also has an account. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said he did not have TikTok and that it was important to be “careful” about any social media site. “TikTok is overall owned by a Chinese company and I think if you put your data on there you are not just sharing it with the person publishing it. The caution is, be careful what you put on these things,” he told LBC.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/24/rishi-sunak-tiktok-cybersecurity-uk-government-officials-china
59,tiktok,Guardian,2023-02-23,European Commission bans staff using TikTok on work devices over security fears,"The EU’s executive body has banned its thousands of staff from using TikTok over cybersecurity concerns, a decision the Chinese-owned social video app has criticised as “misguided” and based on “fundamental misconceptions”. The European Commission sent an email to employees ordering them to delete the app from all work phones and devices, and any personally owned ones that use the commission’s apps and email. Employees have until 15 March to comply. A spokesperson said: “This measure aims to protect the commission against cybersecurity threats and actions which may be exploited for cyber-attacks against the corporate environment of the commission. The security developments of other social media platforms will also be kept under constant review.” The commission said it had enacted the ban in line with its “strict internal cybersecurity policies” and longstanding advice to staff to “apply best practices when using social media platforms and keep high-level of cyber awareness in their daily work. “It is therefore our duty to respond as early as possible to potential cyber alerts,” the spokesperson said. ByteDance, the privately owned parent company of TikTok, has denied there were any data security concerns related to its products and said it wanted to “set the record straight” with the commission. “We are disappointed with this decision, which we believe to be misguided and based on fundamental misconceptions,” said a spokesperson for TikTok. “We have contacted the commission to set the record straight and explain how we protect the data of the 125 million people across the EU who come to TikTok every month.” ByteDance said it was continuing to strengthen its approach to security, including recently announcing the establishment of three new datacentres in Europe to ensure users’ information was stored locally and not exported to foreign jurisdictions, such as China. The company is also reducing employee access to data – an internal report released by ByteDance in December found that four employees violated policies by inappropriately accessing data on TikTok users in the US – and “minimising data flows outside of Europe”. Governments and officials in Europe and the US have taken similar steps to the commission to limit use of the app by employees amid fears that data may be accessed by Beijing. Last summer, a lobbying campaign by Conservative MPs resulted in the closure of the @ukparliament TikTok account. In the US, TikTok has been banned on all federal government devices, and most US states have imposed similar bans. Other countries including the Netherlands are assessing whether to implement restrictions on government employees using TikTok.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/23/european-commission-bans-staff-from-using-tiktok-on-work-devices
60,tiktok,Guardian,2023-02-22,What happens if teens get their news from TikTok? | Letter,"Your editorial on disinformation (17 February) highlights a great challenge, but of arguably greater importance are the sources of news young people use. In a 2022 study, the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford provided quantitative evidence on the growth of social media as a news source for 18- to 24-year-olds. TikTok as a source had increased fivefold between 2020 and 2022, and YouTube stabilised its share of young readers in Asia, the fastest growing populace in the world. Combined with Facebook and Twitter, these sources supply 66% of young people their main news source, and all rely on algorithms. To increase views, clicks and advertising revenues, they show stories that viewers want to see – and slant viewpoints further. The result? Increasingly polarised and conflicting views in society, as people are exposed to a less diverse diet of actual current affairs. As a geography teacher, I regularly ask students how they access news. Sadly, it is now rare that one hand will be raised when I ask about mainstream and unsponsored sources. We have accepted that reading newspapers comes with political and social angles, but social media exacerbates this further by denying broad coverage. I am often asked about my greatest fear for the future. Rather than climate change, I reply “poor information”, as this increasingly undermines cooperation and good citizenship that we, as an ingenious species, can use to solve global problems. My message to them is: “Don’t get news from algorithms.” Ollie Davies Balcombe, West Sussex • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

61,tiktok,Guardian,2023-02-18,Charismatic cats: mountain lion besties gain TikTok following,"The internet has a new favorite pair of celebrity cats: Hazel and Holly, two mountain lion cubs whose recovery journey at a California zoo has attracted a loyal following. The abandoned cubs were brought in just a few days apart to the Oakland zoo, after wildlife officials realized they had been separated from their mothers. They have since forged a close bond, racking up millions of views on the Oakland zoo’s social media pages where viewers watch them cuddle and wrestle together. They are “growing quite fond of each other”, the Oakland zoo said in a 11 February Facebook post. The duo aren’t the first California mountain lions the public has fallen for – celeb cat P-22 lived in Los Angeles’ Griffith Park for a decade and made headlines every time he was spotted. Their influencer status could help raise awareness of an animal that is facing grave challenges: deaths from vehicle collisions and a dwindling habitat that causes inbreeding threaten the species in the near term. The cubs were both rescued from the Santa Cruz mountains by California’s department of fish and wildlife. When cubs are brought in, they are generally emaciated and starving, says Oakland zoo veterinarian Alex Herman, and they also usually have anemia. Sometimes the wildlife officials know what happened with the mother, but other times it’s a mystery, Herman says. “It’s technically called maternal neglect and I hate that term – but they were separated,” she says. Fish and wildlife officials don’t take the situation lightly – if they get a report of a cub alone they set up cameras and monitor the area for days to ensure there isn’t a returning mother. That’s important because once cubs come into a zoo for care, they generally can’t return to the wild for the rest of their lives. In Hazel’s and Holly’s cases, their mothers never returned. And for Hazel, who arrived in early January, it was particularly grim. “We couldn’t believe she could even walk in her condition,” says Herman, adding that the vets assign a body score to animals, with 10 being obese and 1 being emaciated – and Hazel was clearly a 1. “She was literally skin and bones, and needed a blood transfusion as soon as she arrived.” Holly also had no parents around and was rescued in late December, when she was about three or four months old. Each mountain lion has their own personality – Hazel is super curious and self-reliant and Holly is more reserved and tough, Herman says. “They are definitely charismatic and clearly individuals.” Since 2017, the zoo has cared for 24 mountain lions in its 17,000 sq ft hospital, says Herman – and it hasn’t always been straightforward. The longest a mountain lion was in the intensive care area was 34 days: that was Cal, who was treated for burns on his feet after the Zogg fire in 2020. He required daily care and anesthesia to change the bandages. “Cal just was an easygoing guy,” says Herman. “We had to do so much to save his life and he was the most forgiving and friendly.” In addition to healthcare, the rescued animals receive behavioral therapy – the zoo likes to give them choices about their activities to build their confidence. A lot goes into little decisions about their habitat, Herman says: should they be given smooth round logs to play on or unstable logs, so when they walk across it wiggles a little bit? A veterinary rehabilitation doctor helps figure out ways to rebuild their muscles. Some mountain lions are eventually able to return to the wild, but it’s unclear what the future holds for Hazel and Holly. In a few months, they will be transferred to the Big Bear Alpine zoo in the San Bernardino mountains of southern California to spend their days together. Eventually, Herman hopes to create a “rewilding” program so some cubs can be nursed back to health and reintroduced in the wild – but that’s not an option right now. Mountain lions are not critically endangered yet, but their population is in a decline that makes this time especially vital. She points to the need for more wildlife overpasses like the Wallis Annenberg, being built over the 101 freeway in northern Los Angeles county, as the main reason cubs come in without their mother is due to vehicle collisions. In Santa Cruz, the first highway underpass for wildlife was recently completed. “Coexistence is complicated but [it’s] so important to realize the time is now,” Herman says. “This opportunity might disappear in a couple years.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/18/hazel-holly-oakland-zoo-mountain-lion-cubs-tiktok
62,tiktok,Guardian,2023-02-15,TikTok ‘deinfluencers’ tap into trend for saving money,"More and more content creators on social media are rejecting traditional influencer culture and becoming “deinfluencers” instead, according to social media experts. Influencers have historically sold something to users. Whether that is the newest trending lipgloss or the viral “it” dress, the products – often available at a discount using influencers’ special codes – are perceived to provide a certain lifestyle, one that is aesthetically pleasing and on trend. However, a different type of viral trend is taking over. Content creators are deinfluencing users, giving advice on which promoted products are not worth the hype or outright telling them what not to buy. Bita, or @bbybeets, 25, posted a video on TikTok listing items she could not be influenced into purchasing because they’re “just not affordable”. In the video, which has had more than 58,000 views, Bita says people on an average salary cannot afford items such as £95 Ugg Tasman slippers and Apple AirPods Max headphones, which cost about £550, but they feel pressured to buy them to stay on trend. “All the brands I mentioned charge hundreds of pounds per item,” she said. “To purchase a lot of these trending items, you’d have to be on a certain income, and most people aren’t and that’s including me. “I personally love the brands I showed. It’s more that I’m reminding my audience it’s actually not normal to have those things. It’s quite a privilege and a luxury.” On TikTok, the #deinfluencing hashtag has more than 159.6m views. The popularity of the trend is driven by timing and people becoming sick of being told they have to constantly buy something, according to Jago Sherman, head of strategy at the social media marketing agency Goat. “We’ve reached a point of critical mass when it comes to consumerism,” he said. “People are kind of fed up with going on social media and being told: ‘You need this and this’, especially with the cost of living.” For Valeria Fridegotto, 22, a student and part-time content creator living in Chicago, Illinois, the economic climate prompted her to make a video about products she thinks are overrated. “With the economic climate in the US, people are more careful with what they spend their money on,” she said. “I feel like they’re naturally attracted to people who discourage them from buying really expensive items.” Fridegotto named Olaplex shampoo and conditioner, costing about $60 (£50) for the set, the Charlotte Tilbury Beauty Light Wand (£30) and the Dior Backstage Rosy Glow Blush (£31) as products that “don’t deserve the hype” they have been given by other content creators. Her video has had more than 1.3m views and hundreds of comments. The TikTok algorithm “can be follower agnostic”, so users with a relatively small amount of followers can go viral, which has fuelled the trend, Sherman said. “The controversial statements are the ones that get more engagement because people comment,” he said. “A big influencer, unprompted, is less likely to start a trend that is ‘deinfluencing’. This trend would have been started by lots of small content creators and it has essentially trickled up to the bigger influencers, because smaller creators have less to lose by defaming products.” The success of deinfluencing feeds into the broader “eat the rich” narrative seen across the media in films like The Menu and TV shows like The White Lotus, said Paul Greenwood, head of research and insight at social media agency We Are Social. “We’ve seen a lot of creators take this money-saving expert approach,” he said. “They’ll talk about the value of the product, whether you can get it cheaper anywhere else, whether you can buy different products that do the same thing. “They know their audience better than anyone else so if they know their audience is feeling the pinch, they’re going to react to that to try to stay on their side.” While some users in the comments below Fridegotto’s video shared her views about the products, she said she worries her openness might backfire in the future. “In a perfect world, we’d like to think that brands would take it as feedback, but I’m afraid that it might put potential collaboration in prejudice. “I will continue to let people know: ‘Hey, I got this viral thing’ because there will continue to be viral products, but I’ll let them make their own decision,” she said. For Sherman, this trend is going nowhere. “My perspective is that another word for it is an ‘honest’ review. “There have been some people who have said: ‘Is deinfluencing the end of influencing?’ To which I say: ‘Deinfluencing is influencing’ – it’s the exact same thing,” he said. “I see no reason why six months down the line it won’t still be around.”",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/feb/15/tiktok-deinfluencers-trend-saving-money
63,tiktok,Guardian,2023-02-14,"Sportsbet is targeting young women on TikTok to diversify male client base, experts say","The online gambling company Sportsbet is using TikTok to target young women with advertising designed to diversify its predominately male client base, according to gambling researchers and marketing experts. Gambling promotions are banned on TikTok but late last year the Chinese-owned social media company agreed to allow Sportsbet to target Australian users as part of a strictly controlled trial. “A closed pilot for sports betting is currently in operation for one managed client who has obtained permission from TikTok via an application process,” states the company’s advertising policy. Shortly before the US Super Bowl this week, Sportsbet published a video ad with a young woman drawing attention to “novelty bet” markets on Rihanna’s half-time performance. The video ran the “gamble responsibly” tag in small print. “Girls group chat going wild because Rihanna is dropping Super Bowl half-time show teasers and Sportsbet has markets on it,” the video caption said as a young woman typed into her phone. The novelty markets allowed people to bet on what outfit Rihanna would wear, what props she would use, how long she would sing for and what colour liquid would be poured on the winning coach after the match. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Sportsbet has published other videos featuring the Sydney-based influencer Luisa Dal Din. One video ran the caption “me pretending I know horse racing to impress my crush”. A spokesperson for TikTok said the ads were only shown to users 21 or older and were closely monitored. Their frequency was also restricted and users could opt out of seeing them. A Sportsbet spokesperson said the ads had been age-restricted to “minimise the risk of exposure to minors while connecting with adult audiences on the platforms they enjoy”. Toby Ralph, an advertising expert, said Sportsbet was using the TikTok trial to maximise its client base and profits. “This means finding new markets. [Young women] who couldn’t give a shit about the merits of the Chiefs or the Eagles can be induced to pony up cash by connecting to a bet on Rihanna, and suggesting that the tribe they want to join is crazy for it,” Ralph said. “Does this lead to ethical concerns? No. From an advertising perspective, if it’s legal, they will go all in.” The Alliance for Gambling Reform has expressed concern about regulatory oversight of the trial, despite TikTok’s insistence it is strictly controlled. Late last year the alliance complained about the ads to the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission, alleging a breach of the advertising rules. The complaint was dismissed. “As Sportsbet is licensed by the Northern Territory gambling regulator, it is suggested that you lodge your complaint with the Northern Territory Racing Commission,” a VGCCC manager said in an email seen by Guardian Australia. An alliance spokesperson said the TikTok trial “opens the floodgates” to a demographic of Australians who have not always been exposed to gambling advertisements. “The sponsored posts have been gender-targeted with young women being told they can now place bets on superficial things like BeReal times, Love Island and White Lotus season three,” an alliance spokesperson said. Dr Simone McCarthy, a gambling researcher at Deakin University, said young women were an untapped market for the gambling industry. “Gambling is becoming normalised for women and a lot of this has to do with the marketing they see,” McCarthy said. “Our research shows that young women perceive that gambling advertising has begun to appeal to women and that women are increasingly featured in gambling advertising. “We saw this with tobacco. When [companies] saturated the male market they started designing products that were appealing to women and this same strategy is now being used with novelty bets.”",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/14/sportsbet-is-targeting-young-women-on-tiktok-to-diversify-male-client-base-experts-say
64,tiktok,Guardian,2023-02-12,Hedi Slimane’s Celine show revives early 00s hedonism for TikTok age,"If it’s fashionable to be immersive, Hedi Slimane is à la mode. His menswear show for Celine involved a takeover of the Paris nightspot Le Palace, where on the opening night back in 1978 Grace Jones had her clothes torn off by the plastered crowd and was covered by Yves Saint Laurent, on hand with a well-placed cummerbund. Downstairs, almost 50 years later, the place was still fabulous and bedecked with sequins. With a fashion show, gig and party, Slimane’s mission – along with showing the clothes for autumn 2023 – was to create a disco to die for, a playground for the era’s new club kids. And, of course, they came, clad in dramatic looks – for instance, the experimental musician Yves Tumour, who was resplendent in a blue wig, outrageously embellished black leather jacket and fishnet stockings. Meanwhile, the street outside was closed in anticipation of the arrival of Lisa from Blackpink, K-pop’s biggest girl band. Slimane’s talent is to create a parallel universe in which fashion, music and youth subcultures all come together to create a dazzling whole. On Friday night, first there was a fashion show, then a concert by the Irish band the Murder Capital and the Libertines, and then a party that stretched until 3am, populated by the club kids of Paris who were the night’s real stars, and some celebrities ranging from Catherine Deneuve to Wiz Khalifa. At the beginning of the show, Pete Doherty caused some consternation by bringing his large dog with him to the front row, but sadly the many TikTokers in attendance were denied their viral moment when the mutt remained well-behaved and was finally led off by a dog handler. In this beguiling other world, Slimane’s rock’n’roll aesthetic reigned supreme. Since the pandemic, the designer has cocked a snook at the fashion week schedules, preferring either to show films instead of catwalk shows, or to stage huge extravaganzas that take in bands and a party. In December in Los Angeles, he staged a show that included performances by the Strokes and Iggy Pop and a runway that posited a return to skinny jeans – a trend that, as the designer of Dior Homme in the early 00s, he pretty much invented. And Slimane’s instincts have proved lucrative, too – Celine has achieved the €2bn turnover that the LVMH boss, Bernard Arnault, set as a target when the Frenchman took over the house in 2018. Slimane had previously applied his rock’n’roll aesthetic to Saint Laurent, a tenure that was controversial among some fashion critics but supercharged the label’s commercial performance. At the Celine show, Slimane was at his most uncompromising. Dozens of pairs of leather trousers were marched down the catwalk, culminating in a shocking pink, diamante-studded two-piece that Khalifa told the Guardian he would be pleased to wear. Aside from that, in classic Slimane styling there was a fake-fur coat worn over a suit jacket, over a vest with a leopardskin scarf. Slimane has dressed rock stars for years, from David Bowie and Mick Jagger to Jack White of the White Stripes, who was also in attendance. If indie sleaze – the revival of the early 00s’ hedonistic looks – was a theme, Slimane was also nodding to electroclash, the early 00s club phenomenon that rebooted 80s synthpop and took its visual cues from Leigh Bowery’s legendary club Taboo. As well as in-your-face fashion, the show also honoured the community that Slimane has built up over more than two decades. Afterwards, the Libertines played, fronted by Doherty, Slimane’s erstwhile muse when the singer was at the height of his indie rock fame, but who is now, happily, burly and middle-aged. The performance yielded the pleasing spectacle of Khalifa nodding along to the lyrics “they all get them out for the boys in the band”. Slimane has remained unshakeable in his enthusiasm for indie music, despite the fact that in the internet era it has faded as an avatar of youthful rebellion. Nevertheless, the young Parisians in the audience lapped it up, underlining the fact that the whole evening was ultimately a celebration of the simple joy of going out. At its root, Slimane’s Celine is about the pleasure of special occasions. He is instinctively aware of the meaning of clothes – the frock you wear for your birthday, the shoes that make you feel as if you can take on the world. Displaying such an extreme iteration of this idea – even the tracksuit tops were styled with leather trousers – Slimane paid tribute to the youth of Paris. But ultimately the show was about community in the internet age, the power of togetherness and of finding your impeccably dressed tribe.",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/feb/12/hedi-slimane-celine-show-revives-early-00s-hedonism-for-tiktok-age
65,tiktok,Guardian,2023-02-05,TikTok: how the west has turned on gen Z’s favourite app,"The FBI has called it a national security threat. The US government has passed a law forcing officials to delete it from their phones. Texas senator Ted Cruz has denounced it as “a Trojan horse the Chinese Communist party can use to influence what Americans see, hear, and ultimately think”. And in March its CEO will defend its existence before the US Congress. For those unaware of the debate broiling on the other side of the Atlantic, the target of this strong rhetoric might prove surprising: an app best known for viral dances, launching generation Z media stars, and sucking teens down an hours-long content abyss. But the rancorous debate over TikTok that began under the Trump administration has rolled on under President Biden. In addition to a ban of the app on all federal government devices, at least 27 states have blocked TikTok on devices they’ve issued, affecting a number of state schools and universities, too. A bipartisan bill, introduced in Congress last December, stipulates banning the app’s use by everyone in the United States. TikTok scepticism is spreading to Europe too. Some politicians – echoing their Washington-based counterparts – contend that TikTok poses a security risk, warning it could potentially hand user data to Chinese authorities, and/or be wielded as a propaganda tool for the Chinese government – subtly influencing TikTok’s more than 1 billion monthly active users in a direction that dovetails with Chinese foreign policy goals. It’s emblematic of ratcheting Sino-western tensions, where tussling over technology is as much about genuine paranoia over espionage as it is a useful arena for geopolitical grandstanding. In the age of the “splinternet” – which has seen the once-open web fracturing across different jurisdictions – anxieties over data sovereignty and information flows are on the rise. How western governments respond to TikTok could mark a decisive step in how technology is regulated in the decades to come. While accusations that TikTok hands over user data to the Chinese government are so far unsubstantiated, the app’s claims over its trustworthiness took a blow in December with the revelation that employees at ByteDance (TikTok’s parent company) accessed TikTok data in an attempt to track the whereabouts of several western journalists in order to discover their sources within the company. TikTok says the incident involved improper data access and that the employees responsible have been fired, but the transgression has nevertheless served as a lightning rod for apprehensions surrounding the company and the app’s data privacy protocols. Alicia Kearns MP, the Conservative chair of both the Foreign Affairs Select Committee and of the China Research Group, has previously called upon TikTok to provide testimony about the data privacy of UK users. “In their evidence, they said something like ‘This could never happen’,” says Kearns. “Well, obviously that is not true, and it has happened.” (Last October, ByteDance tweeted that “TikTok has never been used to ‘target’ any members of the US government, activists, public figures or journalists.”) TikTok met European commissioners last month to discuss data privacy and content moderation, in the context of how the company plans to comply with the EU’s new digital services regulation. “They’re starting to realise that TikTok is not just another app to communicate, or send videos to one another, or for amusement,” says Belgian MEP Tom Vandendriessche. “TikTok is gathering the data of our citizens.” It’s worth noting TikTok is not the only company that has engaged in this practice: American businesses, including Microsoft and Uber, have also been found guilty of tracking individual users through their products in the past. But in the US, the news arrived at a highly sensitive time for the company. “This should be the final nail in the coffin for the idea that the US can trust TikTok,” tweeted Brendan Carr, a member of the US Federal Communications Commission. *** The conversation in Europe is a little different. So far, the bloc has been less willing to single out TikTok on the basis of the location of its parent company. It is scrutinising the app over data privacy concerns: Ireland’s data protection commissioner opened two probes into the company in 2021 – one focusing on its handling of children’s data, the other to check that its data transfers to China complied with EU data legislation. (A draft decision has been submitted on the first inquiry.) However, this is not unique to TikTok. The likes of Facebook and Google have also become ensnared in Europe’s data privacy laws, and the EU is currently wrangling with the US over whether EU data should be allowed to be sent there, for fears it could be hoovered up by US intelligence agencies. “While some questions about TikTok and our Chinese heritage have become politicised, we take national security concerns very seriously,” says Theo Bertram, vice-president of public policy and government relations, Europe at TikTok. Regardless of where you are, how seriously should you take the warnings? Some technology experts say the accusations are somewhat overblown. Both the data privacy and content manipulation threats cited by politicians currently lack convincing evidence, says Graham Webster, research scholar and editor in chief of the DigiChina Project at the Stanford University Cyber Policy Center in California. “I think both of these theories are possible, but at this point they both require a significant amount of imagination to actually constitute a US national security threat,” says Webster. He doesn’t think it’s unreasonable at this stage to think that Chinese officials might have unauthorised access to TikTok user data. “But you would have to make an argument for why that access can be used in such a way that constitutes a national security threat,” he says. This is because the data held by TikTok isn’t unique. The app can collect location data, but must ask users before tracking detailed GPS data. If the user declines, only their rough whereabouts can be gathered. (In fact, a TikTok spokesperson claims its employees didn’t succeed in the attempted tracking of journalists precisely for this reason.) What’s more, the same data is gathered by any number of apps – and is routinely sold on to third-party data brokers who make it available to prospective buyers. “There are lots of ways that foreign governments can access data in the United States,” says Anupam Chander, professor of law and technology at Georgetown University Law Center, Washington DC. “TikTok seems to be an unlikely target of data gathering by the Chinese government, because of the largely public nature of the activity on the app.” *** Data privacy issues aside, what about the “Trojan horse” argument advanced by the likes of Cruz? Is TikTok secretly inculcating in generation Z a taste for Chinese Communist party talking points? In 2019 the Guardian revealed that the app’s content guidelines for moderators on how to deal with inflammatory content yielded the serendipitous by-product of stifling any mention of Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or Falun Gong – all topics that are suppressed by Beijing. At the time, the company insisted the documents didn’t reflect its current policy and that it had since embraced a localised content moderation strategy tailored to each region. A 2021/22 study by Nato’s Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence found that TikTok compared favourably to other platforms on combating inauthentic manipulation (coming second to Twitter, and ahead of Facebook, Instagram and YouTube). The report recommended more cooperation with external researchers to make it easier to study content moderation on the platform, something a TikTok spokesperson says the app is aiming to grow. Although TikTok has repeatedly said that western user data is not stored in China, that it has never, and would never, share user data with Chinese officials, and that its global content moderation strategy is not beholden to Beijing, over the past six years, TikTok and Washington’s committee on foreign investment in the United States (CFIUS) have been negotiating a deal aimed at finally allaying the concerns of US politicians. The $1.5bn Project Texas involves the establishment of a data centre that will store US user data in Texas, under the watchful eye of Oracle, the American software giant headed up by billionaire GOP funder and Trump ally Larry Ellison. To address fears about content manipulation that serves the Chinese government, Oracle will also inspect the app’s source code and content algorithms. TikTok is now making similar arrangements for Europe. The company is setting up a data centre in Ireland that will store the data of users in the UK and EU. These measures would place the app’s data practices under far more scrutiny than its Silicon Valley competitors, according to Webster. “Based on the reporting of what [Project Texas] would look like,” he says, “it sounds like they’re talking about measures that should basically mitigate these potential security threats – as much as is reasonable, in my opinion.” Whether it will be enough to satisfy regulators is another issue. One party eyeing the negotiations with interest is Facebook, which views TikTok as an existential threat. Last year, the Washington Post revealed a Facebook-backed lobbying campaign targeting TikTok that specifically played on data privacy fears. This could prove money well spent, given that TikTok users say in the event of the app being banned they would probably pivot to (the Facebook-owned) Instagram or other social media apps. More bans raise the prospect of legal challenges on the basis of freedom of speech or expression. The obvious parallels between banning apps and the Chinese government’s strict internet controls have been widely noted – a phenomenon that’s particularly ironic for Republicans, who have spent the past few years pounding the drum for supposed freedom of speech. But there is agreement on one thing – that this should serve as a catalyst for the US to finally start thinking about data privacy more generally. “The idea of foreign ownership as being the critical basis for intervention [on TikTok] seems unwise,” says Chander. “We should have a broader approach that examines the national security risks posed by data flows more generally.” He’s not alone in hoping the TikTok debate might spur progress on the establishment of national data privacy legislation that would protect American consumers on all apps, not just TikTok.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/05/tiktok-how-west-turned-on-gen-z-favourite-app
66,tiktok,Guardian,2023-02-03,Australian TikTok creators could dump app after month-long test removed sound from videos,"A month-long test by social media platform TikTok has resulted in many of its Australian users having the sound removed from their videos, rendering them unwatchable. According to a spokesperson for TikTok, it has been testing in Australia to analyse how music is accessed and used on the platform. “While the test is under way, we expect that some of our users will not be able to access our full music and sounds library. For more than half of our community there will be no change to their experience and the test will not impact them,” a spokesperson for the platform said. However, rather than just the background music being removed, entire audio tracks have been muted, including those used in videos for educational and news content. For Mary McGillivray, a large Australian creator who makes art history content, this has meant approximately 57% of her back catalogue has been rendered unwatchable for a significant portion of her audience. “It’s really confusing, because for a lot of my content I upload my own audio tracks, where I’ve paid for a licence from an external provider, so these aren’t even TikTok sounds … they’ve been flagged as violating TikTok’s community guidelines, but there isn’t even a place for me to respond to the ‘violation’ and provide my music licence,” McGillivray said. She said this has been particularly stressful given that neither the creators or users received any warning from TikTok indicating the existence of the test or their participation in it. McGillivray’s only source of information has been through other, larger creators, with a direct line to workers at the company. “It’s very disappointing,” McGillivray said. “Creators are not guinea pigs, we’re the people who provide the content and therefore the entire value of a platform … it does make you feel like it’s a platform that doesn’t value its creators as much as it should.” ABC News and Guardian Australia have also had sound removed on a number of TikTok videos. McGillivray said it was luck she had alternative revenue streams, but other big name creators have told Guardian Australia that the test poses a serious threat to their livelihoods this month, with scheduled brand collaborations now at risk. The alienation of these users comes at a tricky time for the platform. The Guardian understands a number of large TikTokers have been approached by other short-form video platforms and offered lucrative deals for exclusive content. Some have now said this test may be the “final straw” and they will make the switch. TikTok has developed a symbiotic relationship with the music industry in recent years – with the use of popular songs in videos becoming an integral part of the app’s appeal, and in turn a track’s ability to go viral on TikTok influencing its success. Reports published by Bloomberg suggest TikTok has been engaged in lengthy negotiations with various large record labels over the share of ad revenue they receive in turn for allowing the use of their tracks on the app. The Australian test is being viewed by some as an attempt by TikTok to see if usage remains steady despite limited access to music, thus strengthening their parent company, ByteDance’s, bargaining position. The company has now set up a feedback form for affected creators. In a public statement TikTok apologised for any “disappointment” caused, stating it looked “forward to restoring the full catalogue at the conclusion of the test period.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/03/australian-tiktok-creators-could-dump-app-after-month-long-test-removed-sound-from-videos
67,tiktok,Guardian,2023-02-02,‘Watch this creep’: the women exposing gym harassment on TikTok,"Women have long been hyper-vigilant about unwanted male attention at the gym. But before smartphones, the sense they were being stared at was more of a feeling than a certainty. Now catching perceived offenders in action has become its own sport on TikTok, with women covertly leaving their phones on record and then watching the resulting video to see who was staring at their behind while they were doing squats. On the app, the pitiless hashtag “gym weirdos” has over 1.9m views, with videos showing men attempting to flirt with or pick up women who just want to get through their sets unbothered. Gina Love is one such TikTok detective. She goes to the gym at least four times a week, because the endorphin boost that comes from a good deadlift counteracts the daily stress of life. “Watch this creep come over to my personal bubble while doing [Romanian deadlifts],” Love wrote in the caption of an encounter she posted on TikTok, which was liked over 50,000 times. “The gym was practically empty, and so many corners to be in and he chose this one.” In the clip, the man stands directly behind Love as she lifts dumbbells before deciding to leave. “I would say I experience creeps 15% of the times I work out,” Love, who is 29 and lives in Atlanta, told the Guardian. This usually manifests as a man staring at her for an “uncomfortably long” amount of time. “It’s almost like they’re trying to undress you in their heads,” Love said. Some might say inappropriate looks or creepy comments are as much of a feature in the gym for women as broken workout equipment or crowds. One study from 2021 found that 76% of women feel uncomfortable exercising in public due to harassment. In another survey from Run Repeat, 56% of women reported facing harassment during their workouts. Love sometimes leaves the gym when the staring is too much. “It makes me feel disgusted, anxious and my survival instinct kicks in,” she said. “I’ll typically cut my workout short because I can’t get back into feeling comfortable with that person around me.” Love swaps stories with friends: one recently told her that a man had tried to secretly record her during a workout. Comments on her videos, and others posted by women with similar experiences, elicit different reactions. Some commenters agree that gyms feel like predatory spaces. But others dismiss the women’s complaints as overreactions. “It’s not your personal space,” one person wrote in reply to Love’s clip. “WTF is a personal bubble at a public gym?” another asked. Joey Swoll is a male trainer and TikToker who calls himself the “CEO of gym positivity”. He frequently reposts these videos with commentary on gym etiquette, either exonerating the so-called “creep” or validating the frazzled woman’s feelings to his 6 million TikTok followers. Last month, an influencer named Jessica Fernandez posted a video from the gym showing a man glancing in her direction as she worked out. “I hate this, I hate when there’s weirdos,” she said under her breath in the clip. “Feral, feral, feral, like fucking feral.” The man then asked her if she needed help with a weight, and she declined. Swoll responded to her video, writing: “Women are harassed in gyms and it needs to stop, but you are not one of them. An act of kindness or a glance does not make you a victim.” The video was liked over 812,000 times, and Fernandez ultimately apologized for her post. Swoll and Fernandez did not respond to requests for comment. Why can’t men mind their own business at the gym? Natalia Mehlman Petrzela, a historian and author of the new book Fit Nation: The Gains and Pains of America’s Exercise Obsession, said that gyms had long been gendered spaces. Historically, separate men’s and women’s gyms existed, or health clubs hosted intentional “ladies’ days”. “When I hear about men ogling or hitting on women at the gym, I am often reminded of how for decades, women exercising was considered a kind of sexy spectacle,” Petrzela said. In June of 1972, for instance, New York held its first Mini-Marathon, which was televised and hosted by the hosiery brand L’eggs. Playboy Bunnies flanked the starting line of the race. “It’s clear from the footage that some of the male spectators were there to leer at, rather than cheer on, the women’s athletes,” Petrzela said. Even as second-wave feminism of the 1970s and 80s encouraged women to sign up for workout classes en masse, late-night hosts constantly joked about watching Spandex-clad personalities like Debbie Drake or Jane Fonda gyrate on TV for something “other than the exercise”. In the 1980s, after co-ed gyms became the norm, columnists wrote articles about how gyms were “the new singles bars”, a concept that powered the 1985 romantic comedy Perfect, starring John Travolta as a reporter who falls for a perpetually sweating health coach, played by Jamie Lee Curtis. The majority of today’s gyms are co-ed, and the idea of going back to women-only workout spaces remains controversial. Last year, Connecticut’s supreme court ruled that these areas violated a state law banning discrimination based on gender. Despite this, certain sections of the gym tend to be unofficially sex-segregated. “Women are overrepresented in the studios and on cardio equipment while men disproportionately flock to the weight floor,” Petrzela said. “But the boom in popularity of women weightlifting, and thus being more present in a part of the gym that has traditionally been more male, means that there are probably more instances of those unwanted advances.” This means that women like Love, who find so much joy in working out, have to negotiate with their sense of safety any time they want to head to the gym. “This behavior from men encourages me to work out at the earliest time possible, typically when the gym opens,” she said. “I tend to go with a friend because creeps are more timid when there are two girls together. I try to keep my clothing incognito: oversized hoodie and a hat. It’s sad that girls can’t be comfortable wearing whatever they please to work out without being harassed.”",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/01/gym-weirdos-tiktok-videos-women-recording-sexual-harassment
68,tiktok,Guardian,2023-02-02,I tried the TikTok ‘non-aesthetic’ home fad. But it was a nightmare designed to inflict pain on me | Michael Sun,"You have seen the videos: the celebrities trotting through their squillion-dollar manors on camera, beckoning towards the signifiers of their (and their underpaid assistants’) impeccable, lavish taste. If you scrunch your eyes enough, you can picture yourself living there too: among Troye Sivan’s stupidly chic tchotchkes; in Dakota Johnson’s entirely green kitchen; alongside Kylie Jenner’s inexplicable, outsize James Turrell sculpture. Because I am a writer, my only hope is to marry rich. But that has not stopped me from trying – to the distress of many housemates – to style my hovel like these palatial showrooms, on the off-chance that I become suddenly famous and Architectural Digest decides to email me. I spend my days endlessly fussing and rearranging homewares. I like to think of myself as a Marketplace maven, except for the times I wimp out of a tough negotiation and end up getting scammed by a side table seller (actually this is every time). I tell any and all houseguests that turning on overhead lighting is like killing my firstborn. Well, no, that one is a lie. Overhead lighting would be worse. Call it mass delusion, but I am far from alone. House porn, while hardly a new phenomenon, has made victims of us all over the last three years, sucking us into its fastidiously styled vortex as we languished at home; just look at the deluge of Instagram accounts hawking midcentury goods and bubbly glassware. Buying trend pieces like checkerboard rugs, tiled tables and mushroom lamps makes us feel celebrity-adjacent – like we, too, have a design agency on speed dial and more than $5 to our name. (I am embarrassed to say I own two-thirds of these items.) Yes, overconsumption is bad. Yes, screw fast furniture, algorithmic tastes, egregious displays of wealth, etc etc. But no amount of protest can dim the tiny, monkey part of my brain that lights up when I place a candle into an absurdly shaped holder at just the right angle. If I hadn’t ghosted my therapist she would probably tell me that this is the result of my upbringing with two parents whose primary hobby was mopping, but then again therapists love to tell you everything is about your upbringing. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning But another form of therapy is spreading on TikTok as an antidote to this trend. It’s a call to arms for the “non-aesthetic home” – a hashtag with close to nine million views and counting. Users share videos of broken cabinetry, toys strewn across the floor, sauce stains on walls and doors. You get the point – which is that, like everything on social media, real life doesn’t (and needn’t) resemble the interiors we see online. “Reminder,” one popular video goes. “It’s okay to have a non-aesthetic, visibly lived-in home.” When I encounter this video in my feed, I groan like a petulant child. Also like a petulant child, I eventually acquiesce: would forcing myself to live in a “non-aesthetic home” make my life … better? I set some ground rules for my new, supposedly unencumbered existence: no cleaning up crumbs, no dish-washing, no furniture fussing, no tidying up of any kind unless absolutely necessary – so basically what it feels like to be a straight man. Within 10 minutes, there are flecks of toast on the dining table and I can feel myself heading into withdrawal. A vein is throbbing in my temple. My hand clenches; the involuntary urge to reach for a dish cloth surges through me. Maybe, I say to my housemate – who has graciously allowed me to sully our home for 48 hours – just maybe, I will come out of this a more relaxed person. She immediately laughs. By the end of the day, I am longing for death: sweet release from this nightmare specifically designed to inflict pain on me. There are glasses stacked on the counter, a tea towel crumpled somewhere, a coffee brewer left abandoned in the sink, a rice cooker open like a gaping maw on the bench. I accidentally knock a chair an inch to the left and am not allowed to reset it. “Arggghhhhhhhh!” I scream into the void and an extremely untidy void screams back. My partner comes over and does not notice the whirlwind that has beset the space, because – fine – objectively the space does not look so different, only slightly more ruffled. But I am not objective. I am obdurate and neurotic, and all I can see is clutter (which probably means I shouldn’t have ghosted my therapist). “What if Architectural Digest walks in RIGHT NOW??” I moan. My pleas go unheard. We are more than halfway through the experiment. The house is now well and truly “non-aesthetic”, unless that aesthetic is “food fight”. I now understand why my parents loved mopping so much. With hours to go, I leave the house for temporary reprieve – so blissfully unaware of what’s to come. I am prone to exaggeration, but I promise this next part is the unadorned truth: I return home to find the dryer completely unhooked from the wall after a particularly vigorous cycle, hanging precariously from a single hinge, all of its contents emptied onto the floor still sopping. This, I decide, is enough to make anyone religious: a surefire sign from above to punish me for my feeble attempts to live carelessly. I buckle in the face of this mighty mountain of mess. Then I start cleaning again.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/02/i-tried-the-tiktok-non-aesthetic-home-fad-but-it-was-a-nightmare-designed-to-inflict-pain-on-me
69,tiktok,Guardian,2023-02-01,"Mascara? Accountants? Le dollar beans? On TikTok, nothing means what you think it does | Arwa Mahdawi","OK, quick: define “mascara”. If you answered “a substance you apply with a wand to your eyelashes” or something along those lines, then congratulations – you are officially not a young person on TikTok. If you run in those circles, however, then “mascara” is code for a variety of things ranging from a vibrator to a penis to a romantic partner. Julia Fox, the Uncut Gems actor, came to this eye-opening revelation in an extremely awkward way last week. She made a jokey comment on a viral TikTok video in which someone talked about their “mascara” being stolen and was promptly accused of making light of sexual assault. After a frankly ridiculous backlash, Fox apologised and explained that she thought the person was talking about “mascara like as in makeup”. Which, if you are not very young (Fox turns 33 on Thursday) and not extremely online, is a perfectly natural thing to think. “Mascara” is far from the only code word being used on social media. There are well-founded concerns that posting about “controversial” or explicit subjects might get your account “shadow-banned”, meaning the platform artificially limits your reach. To avoid this happening, users have started getting creative. People will talk about having “seggs”, for example, or use “accountant” as a stand-in for sex worker. Anti-vaxxers on Instagram apparently refer to vaccinated people as “swimmers”. My personal favourite? “Le dollar bean” is code for lesbian (it’s how TikTok’s text-to-speech feature pronounces “le$bian”). Emojis are also deployed artfully: the corn emoji (🌽) is a censor-friendly way to talk about pornography. This modern-day cockney rhyming slang has been termed “algospeak”, because you are gaming the algorithm. Perhaps Fox’s faux pas has put the fear of God into you (as it has me). Perhaps you are wondering if the next time you make an innocent gag on a TikTok about sausage rolls you will be accused of genocide denial. I wish I had failsafe advice on how to avoid this fate. Alas, the only way to stay on the right side of the internet is to stay off the internet. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/01/mascara-accountants-le-dollar-beans-on-tiktok-nothing-means-what-you-think-it-does
70,tiktok,Guardian,2023-01-30,TikTok CEO to testify before US Congress next month over data privacy,"As the US legislative battle over TikTok continues to escalate, Shou Zi Chew, the chief executive of the video-sharing app, will make his first appearance before Congress to testify next month. Chew will testify before the House energy and commerce committee on 23 March, Republican representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers confirmed in a statement on Monday, as scrutiny of the Chinese-owned app over data privacy concerns grows. The news comes after the app was banned on government devices and school campuses in a number of states in recent months, as well as on federal devices after a ban was passed in Congress in December. Next month the House foreign affairs committee plans to hold a vote on a bill aimed at blocking the use of TikTok entirely in the US. “ByteDance-owned TikTok has knowingly allowed the ability for the Chinese Communist party to access American user data,” McMorris Rodgers said, adding that Americans deserve to know how these actions affect their privacy and data security. TikTok has denied these claims, stating: “The Chinese Communist party has neither direct nor indirect control of ByteDance or TikTok,” according to a company spokesman. It confirmed on Monday that Chew will testify. “We welcome the opportunity to set the record straight about TikTok, ByteDance and the commitments we are making to address concerns about US national security before the House committee on energy and commerce,” the spokesman said, adding the company hopes “by sharing details of our comprehensive plans with the full committee, Congress can take a more deliberative approach to the issues at hand”. McMorris Rodgers and other Republican lawmakers have demanded more information from TikTok regarding the app’s impact on young people, concerns about harmful content and details on potential sexual exploitation of minors on the platform. TikTok was first targeted in earnest by the Trump administration in 2020, with a sweeping executive order prohibiting US companies from doing business with ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company. In the three years since, the company has sought to assure Washington that the personal data of US citizens cannot be accessed and its content cannot be manipulated by China’s Communist party or anyone else under Beijing’s influence. While Biden revoked the Trump administration ban in June 2021, the reversal was made with a stipulation that the US committee on foreign investment (CFIUS) conduct a security review of the platform and suggested a path forward to avoid a permanent ban. That review has been ongoing as the CFIUS and TikTok have been in talks for more than two years aiming to reach a national security agreement to protect the data of US TikTok users. The White House on Friday declined to comment on whether it would support a legislative ban on TikTok or the status of the talks.

71,tiktok,Guardian,2023-01-29,OMG! It’s Jane Austen... the TikTok generation embraces new heroine,"“I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book!” wrote Jane Austen in Pride and Prejudice. This weekend, 210 years after the publication of the second of her six novels, Austen’s work is providing as much enjoyment as ever – and to a younger audience than the author probably ever dreamed of. “We have seen an increasing number of young Janeites visiting,” said Alice Hodges, who works at the Jane Austen Centre in Bath. These include children as young as eight. As well as screen adaptations and young adult fiction reimaginings of Austen and her novels, interest is being driven by a proliferation of internet memes and TikToks. These have spawned so many videos, images and hashtags online that it prompted a recent study led by a Cambridge academic entitled OMG Jane Austen. One of its authors has suggested Austen is the most memed writer after Shakespeare. The Bath museum features actor guides who play characters from the books, something that goes down well with younger visitors, says Hodges. It also offers the chance to try on costumes and write with quills. Eleven-year-old Clem Melling, who lives near Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, will be visiting the centre in June for her next birthday. “Jane Austen’s writing is so energetic and fun, I love how witty, funny and clever she is,” she says. “The focus on friendships and relationships means that you aren’t concentrating on historical details all the time. The way she makes funny, sarcastic comments about her characters makes it feel as though she’s talking to you like a friend.” Clem’s sister, Gillie, 10, is also a Janeite. Her favourite character is Eleanor Tilney from Northanger Abbey “because she’s very calm and more relatable to modern girls, especially an introverted girl like me”. Their mum, Hazel Davis, 46, a writer, welcomes her daughters’ interest in Austen. She says: “I am a bit tired of books for children and young adults that are dystopian or apocalyptic. It’s nice to read books with the girls that address human concerns but without angst. “There’s no dumbing down with Austen. She’s smart, funny and insightful, and it’s so lovely that they relate to her writing so much. It’s also a great, fun way to teach history – and especially feminist history. Many of her role models are intelligent and sparky women fighting to change their circumstances.” Julia Golding runs an Austen-inspired podcast, What Would Jane Do?, and is the author of the Jane Austen Investigates series of books, which reimagine the author as a child detective. She, too, has noticed a lot of younger readers coming to the work of the writer, who died in 1817. “It may seem unlikely at first – what does this generation with all their social media options and frenetic visual culture find in Austen?” says Golding. “Then you realise that’s the answer. Jane Austen allows everyone to step aside and take a breath in the beautiful worlds she creates. Then we see that we share more with the past than we imagined.” Even in a world where young girls’ role models seem to be found on Love Island, Instagram and TikTok, there is a space for Austen, says Golding. “Her works are strangely applicable to our online existence. In the smaller worlds of her novel – a village, a great house – everyone is under a microscope, just as young people are with their connectivity,” she says. “Jane Austen might’ve worn a bonnet and muslin but you feel, reading her, that she would’ve been an amazing best friend for us now and help us get out of trouble.” Younger readers often come to Austen through reimaginings such as Golding’s books, or film adaptations. Olive Jenkins, 16, who lives near Esher, Surrey, discovered her four years ago when she saw the 2005 film of Pride &amp; Prejudice on Netflix. “From then, I felt a connection to how true the love presented in this story was, despite complications that make the plot interesting,” says the A-level student, who went on to read the book after seeing the film. “I felt that, despite the tricky language, she imparts a very clear and euphoric idea of love, which is a sense that I only ever get when reading classical literature.” Dr Rita J Dashwood, who specialises in 18th- and 19th-century studies at the University of Liverpool, has researched how media riffing off Austen’s work has affected the author’s legacy and brought new readers to the source material. “The number of recent young adult novels that reimagine Austen’s works – particularly her most popular one, Pride and Prejudice – such as Ibi Zoboi’s Pride (2018) and Alice Oseman’s Solitaire (2014), as well as new media series such as The Lizzie Bennet Diaries (2012) for YouTube, make Austen’s novels accessible to young people in new and engaging ways,” she says. “My experience as a university lecturer is also that, by the time students come to university, they have admired Austen for years, having encountered her both through the original novels and popular culture adaptations of her work.”",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/29/jane-austen-tiktok-generation-heroine-fans
72,tiktok,Guardian,2023-01-24,TechScape: Is ‘banning’ TikTok protecting users or censorship? It depends who you ask,"The US battle with TikTok over data privacy concerns and Chinese influence has been heating up for years, and recent measures have brought college campuses to the forefront - with a number of schools banning the app entirely on campus wifi. Students have responded, of course, on TikTok. Taking advantage of viral sounds, they have expressed outrage at their favourite app being blocked at universities like Auburn, Oklahoma and Texas A&amp;M in the past few months. “Do they not realize people in college are actually adults?” one user wrote. “We should make our own independent decision to use TikTok or not,” another said. But how did we get here? The actions come amid a cascade of TikTok bans by state and federal lawmakers in the US, who say the app’s China-based parent company, ByteDance, could collect sensitive user data and censor content that goes against the demands of the Chinese Communist party. TikTok was first targeted in earnest by the Trump administration in 2020, with a sweeping executive order prohibiting US companies from doing business with ByteDance. That measure was later revoked by Joe Biden in June 2021, but the company’s problems were far from over. The current president stipulated that the US committee on foreign investment (CFIUS) conduct a security review of the platform and suggested a path forward to avoid a permanent ban. That review is ongoing, with no timeline released for a final decision. Meanwhile, states have taken action of their own, with Congress passing a ban of TikTok on all federal devices in December and 31 individual states banning the app on government devices, most of which were passed in the last two months. Most of the campus bans have been carried out in states that have already passed their own rules against the app, but questions remain about how impactful such measures will be. How does banning TikTok work? Schools often block or regulate traffic to certain websites on campus wifi networks, including harmful content and pornography and such measures can extend to specific apps. Similar measures have been taken in the past like with controversial anonymous social media platform Yik Yak. But tech experts say these bans are quite easy to circumvent, as the app will only be banned on shared campus wifi and not on individual devices. To bypass the block, students can simply turn off wifi and use personal cellular data, as one expert told me in my story on the topic this week. “This specific ban will likely count as barely an inconvenience for the students subject to it, and it would be incredibly difficult, if not impossible, both technically and ethically, to enforce students using TikTok on their own personal devices,” said Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at cybersecurity firm Vulcan Cyber. An increased number of students exclusively using data rather than wifi could cause additional issues, like data networks being clogged on campuses, making student devices run more slowly and ineffectively. “This is an extension of the clumsy and extreme state actions we have seen taken against TikTok at state levels,” said Angelo Carusone, president of the non-profit media watchdog Media Matters for America. “The ban will be ineffective and does nothing except score political points and tax already flimsy infrastructure.” ‘A red herring’? Many internet freedom advocates have questioned the policies, saying they amount to censorship and are largely ploys for influence at a time when targeting Chinese technology is politically beneficial. Others say such actions will only ramp up in coming months as election season approaches and politicians try to outdo each other with new measures. “It’s fertile ground, but TikTok is a red herring because such security concerns exist with all platforms,” Carusone said. “It ends up being a hyper-political issue that does not respond to actual threats.” Meanwhile, many who oppose such measures have called for a broader effort to address some of the issues raised by TikTok’s recent legal battles, including the need for a national data privacy law, mandating data transparency, and encrypting messaging on social platforms. “These problems exist on every social media app out there, not just TikTok,” said Gillian Diebold of the Center for Data Innovation.

73,tiktok,Guardian,2023-01-20,The new frontier in the US war on TikTok: university campuses,"There’s a new frontline opening up in the US war on TikTok: college campuses. The China-based app has already been banned on all federal government devices and on government devices in 31 states over data privacy concerns. Now restrictions are spreading to universities, with the Auburn University, University of Oklahoma, Texas A&amp;M and others all blocking the platform from school wifi networks in recent weeks. Such bans are possible because school policies allow for the blocking of traffic to certain websites on campus wifi networks, measures that are typically reserved for harmful content and pornography. But those policies can also extend to specific apps, which has been done in the past with platforms like anonymous social media account Yik Yak. Students at schools impacted by the bans have already taken to TikTok to complain, using popular memes and viral sounds to speak out. “This regime is ridiculous,” one user wrote. Others seem to be testing the limits of such policies: “I’m not allowed to post TikToks anymore, so let’s see if I can,” another user said. “Do you guys see this video?” (The policies only prevent access to TikTok on school networks and do not prevent posting to the app using cellular data.) Some internet freedom advocates are also questioning the policies, calling them a misguided form of censorship. And others say such bans amount to pandering at a time when targeting Chinese technology is politically beneficial. “This is an extension of the clumsy and extreme state actions we have seen taken against TikTok at state levels,” said Angelo Carusone, president of the non-profit media watchdog Media Matters for America. “The ban will be ineffective and does nothing except score political points and tax already flimsy infrastructure.” The university bans come amid a cascade of actions against TikTok in recent months by lawmakers who say its China-based parent company could collect sensitive user data and censor content that goes against the demands of the Chinese Communist party. In late December, Congress passed a measure banning the platform on all federal government devices and similar bans have taken hold in more than 30 states in the past year, including Maryland and Georgia. Many internet freedom advocates have highlighted the irony of states and schools purportedly combatting Chinese censorship by censoring these apps themselves. “If it weren’t so alarming, it would be hilarious that US policy makers are trying to ‘be tough on China’ by acting exactly like the Chinese government,” said Evan Greer, deputy director of non-profit advocacy group Fight for the Future. “This is classic, state-backed Internet censorship.” While bans on state and school devices are easier to implement, the university measures will be much more logistically difficult, experts say, since students can still easily get around them by using cellular data instead. “This specific ban will likely count as barely an inconvenience for the students subject to it, and it would be incredibly difficult, if not impossible, both technically and ethically, to enforce students using TikTok on their own personal devices,” said Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at cybersecurity firm Vulcan Cyber. This could also lead to data networks being clogged on campuses, making student devices run more slowly and ineffectively. TikTok spokesperson Jamal Brown criticized the ban, and warned there could be unintended consequences for students’ ability to share information and connect on campus. “We’re disappointed that so many states are jumping on the political bandwagon to enact policies that will do nothing to advance cybersecurity in their states and are based on unfounded falsehoods about TikTok,” he said. Most of these bans were enacted by schools that take government funds in states such as Texas where lawmakers are already waging political war on TikTok. This chapter marks just the latest example of global culture wars playing out on college campuses, Carusone said. Whether the counterculture movement of the 1960s, the Satanic panic of the 1980s, or allegations of liberal indoctrination on college campuses that began in the 1990s and continue today, young people are often used as pawns in larger political battles. “College campuses can be an important frontline for how the rest of the culture and the political landscape deals with the actual problem,” he said. “Part of the reason political figures feel as though they can get away with these kinds of things is that they feel there won’t be political consequences, they think young people don’t have political power.” Carusone said the battle will only ramp up in coming months, as we move into a presidential primary season during which being “tough on China” is seen as beneficial to both Democrats and Republicans. “This is going to be a new focus where they’re all going to try to out-match each other,” he said. “It’s fertile ground, but TikTok is a red herring because such security concerns exist with all platforms. It ends up being a hyper-political issue that does not respond to actual threats.” The bans distract from legitimate issues at hand, said Gillian Diebold of the Center for Data Innovation, including data privacy, app security and national security. What would be more effective, she added, are measures like passing national data privacy legislation, or mandating transparency around what data is collected and enforcing end-to-end encryption on all social media apps. “Targeting one single app is not going to make a dent in combatting these real issues,” she said. “These problems exist on every social media app out there, not just TikTok.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/20/us-tiktok-bans-university-campuses
74,tiktok,Guardian,2023-01-19,TikTok is overrun by amateur sleuths – so which clues should I leave in case I go missing? | Michael Sun,"If I was a more dedicated podcast listener, I am certain I would be a nutter for true crime, a genre with which I share many core values: a zeal for prying into the lives of total strangers, a generally melodramatic way of talking, an overactive imagination which crafts grand, paranoid narratives from the most quotidian of events. (These are also the traits of anyone who did theatre in high school.) TikTok, apparently, agrees. When Serial exploded the genre in 2014, the power of amateur sleuths – and the sway they possessed over the real-world results of justice – was still a novelty. Now, nearly a decade on, new mysteries sweep through TikTok at dizzying pace. Everyone from awkward boyfriends to supposedly nefarious fiances are held to account on the platform by users conducting their own frenzied investigations, hoping to catch their suspects cheating, philandering and premeditating. The jurors: a million deranged zoomers. The tone: nothing short of fever pitch – the type that accompanies all good conspiracy theories. All of this can be ugly. But it can also be funny: as in a video which has made the rounds in the past month where one true crime obsessive shows off their fastidiously arranged binder containing fingerprints, handwriting samples, locks of hair, medical records – in case they, you know, get murdered and someone decides to start a podcast about it. See above: theatre kids. They’ve labelled this a “5 things in case I go missing binder”, which is a very dry way to describe your own kidnapping. Like all TikToks, the video makes it look somehow sane and easy to collect all the things that would be necessary in a murder investigation. But I wasn’t so sure. *In an extremely true crime voice* I knew I had to investigate, and by investigate I mean assemble my own assortment of personal data in the unlikely scenario that I am murdered. (If you are reading this, please do not murder me.) I make a quick decision to forgo the fingerprint samples, as I have not had access to an ink pad since I was seven and deep into my spy era, when I would subject everyone around me to spontaneous and annoying “forensic” “inspections”. This says a lot about me. Moving onwards: a lock of hair. Luckily, I am able to unearth a pair of barber scissors from the back of the toiletries cupboard. I grit my teeth and lop off one measly bang – then I realise, via a very unscientific Google search, that you are meant to rip your hair out from its roots so that a DNA sample can eventually be procured by a bored 20-year-old scrolling through TikTok. Because I have the pain tolerance of a toddler, I opt out of this cruel and unusual punishment and instead sticky-tape the chunk I’ve already chopped off to a sheet of A4 paper. Next, a handwriting sample – easy enough, though I am convinced my carpal muscles have atrophied to the point that merely holding a pen could give me an immediate RSI. As usual, I am being melodramatic. I am not, however, being melodramatic when a bolt of fear strikes me at the thought of attaining my medical records – the fourth requirement in this binder. For posterity, I phone up the last doctor’s office I haphazardly looked up. They put me on hold for 15 minutes and the line goes dead. I apologise to all future podcasters who are now unaware I had asthma from the ages of five to 12. At last, my binder is almost complete. The final piece is a list of everyone I know and their contact details because, according to the TikTok, “my friends and exes are the first people they need to bring in for questioning”. Personally, it seems like the primary suspects should be my enemies, but what do I know? I reach out to an ex and tell him I am including him in my file. “If you were to murder me,” I ask him, “how would you do it?” Perhaps, I think, he will reply with something ludicrous: a sensational homicide plot straight out of a slasher. Or maybe he’ll be cautious, or even outraged that I could implicate him in such wicked deeds. Instead, his response is entirely unblinking. “Slow poison or choking,” he texts back instantly, as if he has stewed on this many times before. This is when I know the binder has gone too far.

75,tiktok,Guardian,2023-01-17,Children hurt eating liquid nitrogen ‘dragon’s breath’ snack in Indonesian Tiktok trend ,"More than 20 children have been hurt in Indonesia after taking part in a TikTok trend in which they are filmed devouring a street snack infused with liquid nitrogen known colloquially as “dragon’s breath”. The government has warned of the dangers of using liquid nitrogen in ready-to-eat food and urged greater vigilance after some children suffered stomach burns and food poisoning while eating chiki ngebul or chikibulis – a rainbow assortment of candies coated in a cloud of liquid nitrogen mist. The liquid nitrogen causes the snack to appear to smoke when consumed but if it is consumed before the liquid nitrogen has evaporated, there is the potential for intestinal burns and perforations, and in the most severe cases it can lead to death, said Dr Dicky Budiman, an Indonesian doctor and researcher of global health security at Griffith University. Skin burns and severe breathing difficulties are other potential risks, the Indonesian ministry of health’s director general, Maxi Rein Rondonuwu, said in a statement. No deaths have been reported, but the ministry said around 25 children have been affected, with two hospitalised. Budiman said the number of children affected could be much higher. The ministry has asked local health agencies to supervise restaurants using liquid nitrogen whilst informing them of how consumers can enjoy it safely. “Mobile hawker food outlets” are advised against selling such snacks at all. It has also asked schools to educate children about the dangers. On TikTok, dozens of videos, accompanied by dance music, show teenagers and young children with tendrils of smoke coming from their mouths as they devour chiki ngebul. In one video that has racked up nearly 60,000 views, a toddler can be seen puffing the smoke through the hole in the sweet. Although the snack has been around for several years and liquid nitrogen is commonly used in food, such snacks are now easier to access than they historically have been, said Budiman. “Maybe now it’s decreasing [in price] and not only easier to access but also the number of new businesses using this liquid nitrogen is also increasing”, he said. They’re often sold by street vendors, and many food handlers don’t know how to use liquid nitrogen properly, while children aren’t aware of its dangers, said Budiman. “For some teenagers, the experience [of] dangerous things [generates] more enthusiasm. They [are] eager to try it. That’s a dangerous thing,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/17/dragons-breath-tiktok-trend-children-hurt-indoneseia-eating-liquid-nitrogen-dragon-snack-chiki-ngebul
76,tiktok,Guardian,2023-01-12,‘Uh oh … boom!’: TikTok is in love with simulated shipwrecks,"A shark swims slowly and serenely beneath the Bismarck seconds before it sinks deep into the ocean. Seemingly out of nowhere, the battleship tilts and falls; its bow crashes on to the seabed. Its hull floods before briefly resurfacing out of the water. Then the voiceover says: “Oh! Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh! Boom!” The Bismarck snaps in half and sinks. This was not the Bismarck’s real end, but a shipwreck simulated by Alex Reifsnyder, a 27-year-old retail supervisor from Pennsylvania. Reifsnyder uses the physics simulator Floating Sandbox to sink ships with tidal waves, icebergs and lightning for between one and two hours almost every night. On his TikTok page @an_angry_flyy, 167,000 loyal followers cannot get enough. Not even they seem to know exactly what draws them. A comment under one video from October reads: “Don’t know what I am watching … and why … but I still come back every day.” Though some are given a soundtrack of slow, sinister music and others upbeat pop, all Reifsnyder’s videos seem to capture the terror of an eerie expanse of ocean that has the power to crush you and drag you down. The comment section reveals that viewers cannot help but picture themselves onboard: “Imagine your boat goes completely airborne,” reads one, while others joke: “I’m fine, I had my seatbelt on,” and “I’d survive.” There is also a clear appetite for further destruction: “Can fire be added or an explosion?” asks one commenter. Another requests: “Could you drop it from the sky into the water?” More than 1.7 million people watched the Bismarck go boom in early October, and Reifsnyder’s most popular video has 21m views. In it, an unfathomably tall wave approaches the Bismarck as Hans Zimmer’s Cornfield Chase from the film Interstellar plays. The ship is lifted up into the air; its stern slams into the ocean and snaps in half. Water pours into the ship. In pieces, it sinks to the seabed. “I’ve always had an interest in the Titanic, the Britannic, the Lusitania. I’ve watched a lot of history videos on these ships,” says Reifsnyder, who began wrecking ships in July 2022 after two years of failing to get fans by streaming the shooting game Call of Duty. Finding fans has not been a problem this time. “A lot of people find it really satisfying,” he says. “It’s actually pretty therapeutic to watch boats sink. In my streams, I create a very relaxing and inclusive environment for everybody and anybody.” Initially, Reifsnyder’s viewers were mostly men aged 15 to 35, but recently others have hopped onboard. “I have noticed more females coming in and watching,” he says, “I even have people that speak languages that I can’t even recognise.” Reifsnyder is bilingual and occasionally speaks Spanish on streams. “A lot of people tell me I have a great narration voice,” he says. His commentary varies from deadpan and descriptive to excitably absurd: “It’s going to get yeeted into the air!”, “Oh my, into the spikes she goes.” Dr Coltan Scrivner, an expert on morbid curiosity, argues that what keeps people coming back is that it is a form of learning. “Humans, like other animals, have a built-in cognitive bias that encourages them to pay attention to situations that can inform them about threats or danger,” says the research scientist at the Recreational Fear Lab in Aarhus University, Denmark. Scrivner says such “threat information” is especially appealing “when the cost to look is low – such as when we watch the news, play a game or see a simulation. “Our minds see a simulated shipwreck as an opportunity to learn important and consequential information at a very low cost. This makes it difficult to look away.” Reifsnyder, too, views his content as educational, not about mocking tragedies. Unlike other games, there’s “nobody onboard” the ships of Floating Sandbox, and no population counter that ticks down as a vessel sinks. “This is all about history, and we’re learning physics here,” Reifsnyder says. “Hydrodynamic physics are accounted for in the game, thermodynamics are accounted for, gravity is accounted for.” Or to put it another way: Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh! Boom!",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/12/tiktok-is-in-love-with-simulated-shipwrecks
77,tiktok,Guardian,2023-01-10,TechScape: TikTok has been spying on reporters – exactly no one is surprised,"Hello and welcome to TechScape. Alex is now off on paternity leave, and in his place a rotating cast of writers will give their takes on the world of tech. Apologies to any readers who have begged Alex for fewer stories about Elon Musk and crypto, but in a post-Twitter takeover world there are no quiet weeks for tech reporters. In the last few weeks, Musk has handed over documents for the latest edition of the “Twitter Files” to controversial author Alex Berenson (with the not-so revelatory news that Twitter was asked not to spread vaccine misinformation); hinted that we’re getting 4,000-character long tweets; and tweeted messages about the arrest of disgraced influencer and the “king of toxic masculinity” Andrew Tate. All of this has happened while the share price of his electric car company, Tesla, has cratered. For good or ill – and it appears mostly, so far, to be ill – Musk became the main character of 2022, Trumping tech. Which is why I hope you’ll forgive us for focusing quite so much on him – and continuing to do so into 2023. Because, like Trump, Musk’s way of doing things has a butterfly effect beyond Twitter. Musk (pictured above) is redrawing the TechScape, and how we as journalists (and politicians as regulators) should treat it. Alex Hern has, like I have, long treated big tech with a healthy dose of scepticism. The Guardian was among the main outlets to hold Facebook’s feet to the fire during the Cambridge Analytica scandal; it uncovered issues with TikTok’s content moderation system; it (rightly) laughs at the metaverse. It’s long been obvious that social media executives can’t always grapple with the issues they need to, given their companies’ central role in our society, and I personally have felt that they’re just not up to the job of understanding their own impact. Yet with hindsight we might now appreciate how lucky we were. Even if big tech’s executives weren’t always up to the task, they recognised the enormity of the problem. Mark Zuckerberg made plenty of bad decisions and acted many times in his own flagrant self-interest, but he seemed to realise his company’s position in our lives meant he had to try and keep his platform in check. There’s little sense of that with Musk. The risk is that, just as politicians started flouting the norms after they realised Donald Trump got away with it, other tech executives could start doing the same. We may look back on 2022 and think we never had it so good when it comes to big tech’s behaviour – which is a worrying thought. The metaverse … lives? Breaking news this week that the flatlining folly known as the metaverse could – and I stress could – be resuscitated. Ever since Facebook overhauled its entire business and rebranded itself as Meta in late 2021, the metaverse has been little more than a dream of Mark Zuckerberg’s looking for a use case. The reason? No consumer wants to spend thousands of pounds on virtual reality hardware (pictured above) that could increase the likelihood of tripping in their own home just to enter a universe with sub-Sims graphics. Until now. Bloomberg reports that Apple is due this spring to unveil a virtual and augmented-reality headset, in what is the world’s worst-kept secret. It’s a significant moment, not least because there’s a supposition (which may be wide of the mark) that Apple could do to virtual reality headsets, and therefore the metaverse, what it did to the smartphone in 2007. Back then, people didn’t see the point of having an all-in-one device that could replace one’s camera as adeptly as it could take a call. They didn’t always see the point of apps. But 16 years on, we’re in thrall to Apple’s world. The theory is that the headset, which may be called Reality Pro, could propel the metaverse out of the realm of wonky tech nerds and into the mainstream. But as with everything Apple, it’ll come at a (hefty) cost. The metaverse just got interesting again. Ticktock for TikTok? Another major news story broke in the tech world. TikTok slipped up for the first time – and it was a biggie. Two days before Christmas, TikTok sent an internal email from parent company ByteDance general counsel Erich Andersen revealing that staff members spied on reporters covering the company. I have some experience covering TikTok and, like a phalanx of reporters, I have been searching for the story that torpedoes the company. Not out of malice, but because every tech company has skeletons in the closet. So far, plenty of talented reporters couldn’t find much beyond the issues that blight every big tech company: bullying (£), content moderation missteps and white lies (£) that aim to make the platform seem less intrusive than it is. It turns out that we didn’t need to dig to find the smoking gun. TikTok did it for us. It’s hard to overestimate how much of an own goal their spying is for TikTok. Sinosceptic politicians in the UK and US, for instance, might argue it confirms their fears that the company is not truly westernising itself, and they might argue that claims TikTok is unmooring itself from Chinese government control are little more than lip service. The spying decision is, in its own way, as significant as Elon Musk ripping up of the rule book on how to be a big tech executive. It’s the worst possible start to 2023 for TikTok, and means the company must rebuild trust not just with politicians and users but also with the reporters who cover the company.

79,tiktok,Guardian,2023-01-07,TikTok car-fishing craze leads to closure of ancient Rufford ford,"Deep in the English countryside is an ancient river crossing that has been used, in various forms, for at least 1,000 years. It featured in the Domesday Book, attracted Cistercian monks who built an abbey nearby, and more recently served as a handy shortcut for Nottinghamshire commuters. But Rufford ford has now been closed, after clips of cars driving through it attracted hundreds of millions of views on TikTok. “That ford has been there since Adam was a lad,” said Neil Clarke, a local councillor. He decided to close the crossing this month after requests from the fire and police services, who were unable to cope with a small rural lane becoming one of the most famous roads in the world. “With the age of social media it has become a tourist attraction. People are driving there specifically to have a go at going through the ford. They don’t realise how deep it is and suddenly their car starts floating,” Clarke said. Rufford ford cuts across Rainworth Water, a small river east of Mansfield. When the weather is dry, the river crosses the road as a small trickle that is easily traversed. But after heavy rain it becomes several feet deep and up to 30ft (9 metres) wide, and the crossing resembles a log flume at a theme park. Over-optimistic drivers have a moment of realisation as their cars are turned into a boat. As their engines fill up with water, they are left begging onlookers to tow them out. For years this was a local concern. Then in 2020, a local teenager called Ben Gregory started uploading videos he had filmed to YouTube of cars conking out in the water. Suddenly, a small Nottinghamshire lane was a global tourist attraction with an obsessive fanbase. “People love seeing pain and failure,” said another YouTuber, who insisted on being referred to by his online username midlifecrisis101x. “They don’t want to seeing people winning. What they want to do is to watch idiots and go: ‘I’m having a really bad day but he’s having a worse one.’” This 50-year-old YouTuber has spent months filming at the ford alongside Gregory. He said audiences delighted in watching other people failing. “It’s wanton stupidity. You’ve got a perfectly good motor vehicle and a sign that says road closed. Why are you going to put your car in that?” Capturing a car failing can take hours of time, with the YouTubers filming hundreds of crossings before getting footage that elicits peak schadenfreude, such as a waterlogged BMW or Mercedes. “It is relaxing there – it’s like fishing. But you’re fishing for cars,” midlifecrisis101x said. As for the motivation of those crossing the river, he believes there is a deep “bloodlust” on the part of drivers who want to drive a vehicle worth tens of thousands of pounds through a flooded ford. “It’s like when somebody knows they’re about to do something wrong, they won’t look around, and they carry on and do it anyway.” The global interest in Rufford ford quickly became hard to manage. Large crowds turned up on the narrow, tree-lined country lane, parking their cars and bringing their families to spend a day cheering drivers attempting the crossing. Local businesses did a strong trade in ice-creams. Nottinghamshire police had to divert officers to manage numbers. Other YouTubers and influencers turned up, creating a bank of cameras filming every crossing. Occasionally, the fire service had to send staff to help pull cars out. Midlifecrisis101x said: “I had a guy come over from Germany and spend a week in his car in the car park. Twice. He’d just sit there with his supply of food and watch.” The videos became valuable YouTube content, with the creators receiving a cut of the site’s advertising revenue, earning tens of thousands of pounds. But the crowd control really began to get out of control over the course of this year as the videos made their way from a core loyal audience on YouTube to TikTok, where algorithm-driven recommendations drove millions of new viewers to the mill. This intense attention provided by TikTok, according to midlifecrisis101x, resulted in a change in the type of person who was coming to the ford. “TikTok attracts a more excitable audience who want instant entertainment, they want 15 to 20 seconds of high-adrenaline consumption. The high-energy people came to Rufford ford. It was originally fishing for cars, and then TikTok brought more energy – and not in a good way.” Clarke, who is the cabinet member responsible for highways and environment at Nottinghamshire county council, said crowds were encroaching on the road and it was becoming a public safety hazard. “We had complaints saying we’re spoiling everyone’s fun. I’m sure it’s great entertainment and people go to watch the spectacle, but I don’t think people realise there’s a lot of danger and hazard. Very quickly things like this can change to a tragedy.” The councillor said the ever-growing online attention had caused people to attempt riskier crossings in recent months. “There was a motorcyclist who approached it at 50mph, went full pelt, and came straight off head over heels over the handlebars. He went so fast he bounced all the way along the water before collapsing on the other side in a heap.

80,tiktok,Guardian,2023-01-06,"Why is TikTok obsessed with dogs that look like pizza slices, and why is that making me sad?","OK Calla, apparently there is a new TikTok trend that has not yet filtered through to Instagram, where geriatric millennials like me can “discover” it. Tell me about it. Jo, I’m so glad you asked. To understand this meme, you need to know two very important things about TikTok. The first is that the good people of the clock app are absolutely mad about borzois, or Russian wolfhounds. You know, the lanky, wispy-haired dogs that look like they have just appeared on a misty bridge at midnight to ask you their riddles three. A large part of this popularity is due to a borzoi named Esper, who sadly died last year. Esper was owned by Jacob Chattman, a US actor whose account is dedicated to the animals he calls hose goats. The hose goats, in turn, are dedicated to ruining his life by howling. The second thing you need to know is that if a song exists, there will be a Muppet cover of it on TikTok. They often sink below the waves but occasionally the algorithm will drag one to the surface and whenever that happens, a meme is born. You had me at “lanky, wispy-haired dogs”. So what do the memes look and sound like? The essential feature of the borzoi is its extremely long nose. Just a lone pair of nostrils and then miles and miles of snout before you reach the eyes, which always convey the expression of an animal that has suffered a moral injury. They look like a stray sock with eyes on. So a few months ago, people started dueting videos of borzois with a googly-eyed sock puppet. Then people realised that if you draw two little dots on a HB pencil, that also looks like a borzoi. Around Christmas time, a video of another dog that looks like a pencil with eyes was dueted by a pencil with eyes that looked like the dog, paired with the FKA twigs song Cellophane as sung by Miss Piggy. And now I cannot escape it. Everything looks like a borzoi. Surely not that many objects look like a long-faced European dog? Hotel room taps. The pump dispenser on a bottle of moisturiser. Other dogs with slightly less long noses (one of the earliest memes featured a Silken windhound). Anteaters. A doorstop. A collection of taxidermy at Oxford Museum. A banana. Shelving brackets. A skinny slice of pizza. Whatever this thing is in the birthing ward with Jacob Chattman and his partner and new son (congrats btw). They are everywhere. Oh my. I find this both very funny and weirdly … poignant? I want to adopt all these weird little triangular objects. How can a skinny slice of pizza make me feel so much? It may be because sighthounds, with their short life spans, remind us of the ephemeral nature of life. Their soulful eyes, or two burnt patches on a skinny piece of pizza, tell us that every moment is to be treasured. But I suspect the real reason is that FKA twigs is a very good songwriter, even when being covered by a Muppet.",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/06/why-is-tiktok-obsessed-with-dogs-that-look-like-pizza-slices-and-why-is-that-making-me-sad
81,tiktok,Guardian,2023-01-05,Screen and heard: is TikTok changing the way pop stars perform?,"After a punishing two years for the live music industry, pop shows returned with full force in 2022, with many of the world’s top-tier stars jostling to see their fans in a live setting once again. Punters have been faced with an embarrassment of riches, from Harry Styles’ multi-night US arena residencies to Charli XCX’s Grecian rave fantasia to Dua Lipa’s Studio 54-esque disco spectacular. But even if you couldn’t afford the higher-than-ever price tags for big pop shows – the result of a significant labour shortage and the need for artists to recoup losses after two years without touring – it was also easier than ever, in 2022, to experience shows from afar. The year’s most-talked about tours – Lady Gaga’s Chromatica Ball, Lorde’s Solar Power tour, Rosalía for Motomami and the 1975’s At Their Very Best – felt as though they were designed to be shared on social media, with clips from each show proving inescapable on TikTok and Twitter. Each night of Gaga’s tour trended on Twitter; each new 1975 show has led to a flood of new footage of frontman Matty Healy doing all manner of outrageous things from kissing fans to eating raw meat. For fans watching online, the beats of each show became as indelible as the actual hits. Tobias Rylander, who designed the 1975’s tour, says he’s always trying to put together “a show that reads well on social media”. Over his time working with the band over the past decade, he says, his designs have become increasingly “Instagram-ready” – the band’s previous tour, for example, featured vertical screens, “so people could actually hold their phone the way they wanted to and take pretty pictures.” Rylander even says that he tries to design shows “so that any fans googling or YouTubing the show will be able to tell, by the colour of the thumbnail, what year it was and what song it was”. For the 1975 At Their Very Best tour, Rylander and the band wanted to highlight the performers onstage – a shift from the bright LED screens and coloured lights of past shows – so he instead conceptualised a house set lit in white, like a theatre production. Part of this was due to Covid: Rylander says that because lighting technology, trucks and crews are “twice, if not three times” more expensive than pre-pandemic, “we couldn’t afford the big, expensive tech lights”. Rylander and the band were also conscious of their environmental impact, and the house set allowed them to build a show with few bespoke parts that would have to be shipped from continent to continent. Instead, the set is largely built of steel and aluminium, and has created “minimal landfill waste”. Still, one thing didn’t change: “We wanted the set to read well on camera, both moving image and still.” Rylander isn’t the only designer keeping fan footage in mind when working with pop stars. LeRoy Bennett, a lighting and production designer who works extensively with Lady Gaga, as well as Paul McCartney, Ariana Grande and the Weeknd, says that he and Gaga were “absolutely” thinking about social media when designing the Chromatica Ball. “I take that approach quite a bit because social media has become such a big part of the world,” he says. When conceptualising the Chromatica Ball, Bennett was drawn to the “stark, strong, harsh” world of brutalist architecture; the resulting show featured a dramatic grey set bright enough to be perfectly captured for social media and neutral enough for Gaga’s outlandish outfits to stand in stark relief. “The people way at the back have to see the artist – so when you light an artist, you have to pretty much do what you would do for a television show,” he says. “It’s a combination of theatre and TV, and a rock show and a pop show. It lends itself to that social media-friendly atmosphere.” The clean, dynamic design of the Chromatica Ball is mirrored in the sets of Rosalía, the 1975 and Lorde. Rosalía performs on a brightly lit white backdrop against which she and her dancers dance and scoot around the stage. Lorde’s show is architectural and geometric – and plainly striking enough for one fan to get a tattoo of the show’s bold centrepiece. All four shows look great on TikTok. In Rosalía’s, the gigantic vertical screens on each side the stage outright mimic the video-sharing app’s interface. Phones are situated around the stage for her musicians and dancers to broadcast to the screens throughout the show, with certain moments – selfie videos with fans taken from high-up, a spare ballad with a phone propped against the piano lid as she plays – echoing the familiar visual formatting and intimacy of popular videos on the platform. Chiara Stephenson, a stage designer who has worked with Björk and the xx, and who worked on Lorde’s tour, describes herself as a “theatre creature” – she trained under Michael Grandage and Christopher Oram – and says she wanted to bring a “theatrical sensibility” to the Solar Power shows. Unlike Bennett and Rylander, Stephenson says that she wasn’t thinking about social media when working on the tour, despite the telegenic setup. “With the amount of people coming to see the show over the months, you can’t get away with it just being aesthetic,” she says. “What [Lorde] is doing is so rooted and grounded in the music that the law for us was: what’s enhancing the music? What’s telling a story?” Lorde’s intention, she says, was to step away from the gargantuan LED screens that are often standard in pop shows and return to something more analogue, but still distinctive. “I’m most excited, when you’re in an arena or theatre, feeling the three-dimensionality of the light coming through whatever the sculpture or design is on stage,” Stephenson says. “That’s something you can’t ever really capture – I’m delighted that it photographed well, but that wasn’t the guiding reason.” Even so, it’s undeniable that many of the year’s most viral moments on TikTok were derived from live shows this year: Rosalía elaborately chewing gum during her song Bizcochito, Healy relentlessly touching his crotch, Gaga belting a power ballad while wearing an Edward Scissorhands-style claw and standing on a flaming stage. Perhaps these moments are reverse-engineered to go viral or, perhaps, fans are just sharing more content than they used to, thrilled to be back in arenas and metres away from their heroes. “Doing shows after all this time, it’s a joyous moment for the audience,” says Bennett. “People always want to go to see live entertainment. I mean – you can only watch so much TV.” The 1975’s At Their Very Best UK tour starts in Brighton on 8 January",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/05/screen-and-heard-tiktok-changing-pop-shows-rosalia-lorde-1975
82,tiktok,Guardian,2023-01-03,Matt Hancock closes his app and urges users to follow him on TikTok,"Matt Hancock has closed his personal app, five years after its launch made it a 24-hour social media hit. The Matt Hancock MP app was launched in 2018 when the West Suffolk MP was culture secretary as part of Theresa May’s government. He said he hoped it would keep his constituents up-to-date and “promote a healthy, open and impartial debate within its community”. However, within hours it was full of users, many who were journalists or people trolling the MP, who realised that they did not have to live in Hancock’s patch to become members. One early post that gained popularity was someone posing as Ed Balls, mimicking his famous “Ed Balls” tweet. Settings were later changed to discourage non-constituents from registering. In a post released on the app on Tuesday, Hancock announced he was calling time on his virtual venture. He said: “After almost five gloriously fun years, it’s time to bid a fond farewell to the ‘iconic’ Matt Hancock App – a platform that secured multiple exclusives, including my backing of Rishi Sunak for PM. “While the news will come as a blow to those who can’t remember life before the app, fear not …,” he said, before recommending people follow him on TikTok. “Thanks for the memories and see you all soon,” he added. The app wasn’t Hancock’s only foray into the digital world. He also planned to speak to the 2018 Conservative party conference as a hologram. However, his alternative address did not go ahead. In December the former health secretary announced he would be standing down as an MP at the next election. He had appeared on I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here! as a contestant, and finished third – losing the Conservative party whip in the process.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/03/matt-hancock-closes-his-app-and-urges-users-to-follow-him-on-tiktok
83,tiktok,Guardian,2023-01-01,Andrew Tate arrest: TikTok and Twitter under fire over false posts from fans,"Social media firms are under fire this weekend for allowing the spread of misinformation by followers of “king of toxic masculinity” Andrew Tate after his arrest in connection with a human trafficking investigation. In the hours after his detention, TikTok and Twitter were flooded with posts falsely claiming he had been freed and conspiracy theories saying he had been set up, Observer analysis shows. Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said: “Having conspiracy theories proliferating which might put at risk the integrity of an investigation or the safety of those involved is unconscionable.” Tate, 36, a British-American internet personality best known for his misogynistic views, was arrested with his brother Tristan in Romania on 29 December as part of an investigation into human trafficking, rape and organised crime. An investigation by the Observer in August into the former kickboxer and Big Brother contestant revealed that TikTok was aggressively promoting his content to users including boys and young men. Members of Tate’s online academy had been instructed to post deliberately controversial clips in an effort to boost engagement and manipulate the algorithm. After his arrest last week, a statement from prosecutors said four people, including two Britons, were suspected of being part of a criminal group that sexually exploited women after luring them with promises of a relationship. The women were allegedly subjected to “physical violence and mental coercion through intimidation, constant surveillance, control and invoking alleged debts” and forced to make pornographic videos. Six potential victims had been identified. Further details of the specific allegations against Tate have not been made public. On Friday, it was confirmed that he would spend the next 30 days in detention as Romania’s Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism continues its inquiries. On social media, thousands of supporters have already reached their verdict. On TikTok and Twitter, Tate’s fans claimed without evidence that he had been framed, using hashtags such as #freetopG and #tateinnocent. “People lie because they hate Tate,” one wrote on Twitter. “I’m 100% sure Tate is innocent. FREE TATE,” said another. Others blamed “the Matrix” for setting him up. This was fuelled by Tate himself in a tweet posted after news of his arrest: “The Matrix sent their agents,” he wrote on Friday. Since the release of the 1999 sci-fi film about people living in a simulation, where a man is given the choice to take a red pill and “wake up”, the metaphor has been repeatedly repurposed in a range of conspiracy theories, as well by fringe online groups who use “redpill” to mean men waking up to the “reality” that feminism subjugates them. On TikTok on Friday, the most-liked recent video about Tate was one that appeared at first to be a factual report but ended by asking viewers: “What do you guys think is the real reason Tate was arrested? Was it the Matrix, or did Tate actually commit a serious crime?” On Twitter, where Tate has more than 4m followers after his account was reinstated in November, many posts referenced #Pizzagate – a debunked theory that predated QAnon and claimed senior Democrats were behind a child sexual abuse ring – and suggested he was being used as a scapegoat by real paedophile rings. In a video made shortly before his arrest, after a Twitter spat with the climate activist Greta Thunberg, Tate had appeared on camera with a pizza box in front of him in what some speculated was a reference to the conspiracy. “They want to cover up Pizzagate with Andrew Tate,” one Twitter user wrote, tagging Elon Musk. Other accounts posted old videos suggesting Tate had been cleared, despite him remaining in detention. One clip viewed 780,000 times on Twitter by Saturday claimed to show him being freed from custody. “Andrew Tate got Released Matrix attack Failed,” the caption read. The fierce defence of Tate and spread of misinformation since his arrest will add to concerns about the impact on any future legal proceedings and raise questions for the social media platforms that helped propel him to the mainstream. In the weeks after the Observer’s August investigation, TikTok banned Tate’s official account and said it took a tough stance on hateful content including misogyny. On Saturday night, TikTok said it had begun a systematic review of content flagged with it and would remove any that violated its guidelines, which ban “misinformation that causes significant harm to individuals, our community, or the larger public”. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jan/01/fans-andrew-tate-king-of-toxic-masculinity-flood-web-arrest
84,tiktok,Guardian,2022-12-31,Why did the US just ban TikTok from government-issued cellphones?,"The US government has approved an unprecedented ban on the use of TikTok on federal government devices. The restrictions – tucked into a spending bill just days before it was passed by Congress, and signed by Joe Biden on Thursday – add to growing uncertainty about the app’s future in the US amid a crackdown from state and federal lawmakers. Officials say the ban is necessary due to national security concerns about the China-based owner of the app, ByteDance. But it also leaves many questions unanswered. Here’s what you need to know. Why did the ban happen? The US government has banned TikTok on federal government-issued devices due to national security concerns over its China-based parent company, ByteDance. The US fears that the Chinese government may leverage TikTok to access those devices and US user data. TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter said the company was “disappointed” that Congress moved forward with the proposal and that it was “a political gesture that will do nothing to advance national security interests”. The ban means that, in about two months, federal government employees will be required to remove TikTok from their government-issued devices unless they are using the app for national security or law enforcement activities. The director of the US Office of Management and Budget and other offices have 60 days to come up with standards and processes for all government employees to remove the app from their phones. Several federal agencies such as the White House and the defense, homeland security and state departments have already banned TikTok, so it won’t change anything for those employees. And earlier this week, Catherine Szpindor, the chief administrator of the House of Representatives, also instructed all staff and lawmakers to delete the app from their devices. How did we get here? US security concerns about TikTok have existed for years. Donald Trump first attempted, unsuccessfully, to ban TikTok in 2020, but bipartisan efforts to regulate and rein in use of the app reached a fever pitch in 2022 after news outlets reported ByteDance employees were accessing US TikTok user information. National security concerns were reinforced by warnings from the FBI director, Christopher Wray, that the Chinese government could use the app to gain access to US users’ devices. Several, predominantly Republican-led states – including Texas, South Dakota and Virginia – have also recently banned the use of TikTok on state government-issued devices. In April, Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a similar ban to the one now taking effect, calling TikTok a “Trojan horse for the Chinese Communist party”. The measure, the contours of which were largely replicated in the ban that was passed on Friday, was unanimously approved by the Senate earlier in December. Have other countries taken similar actions against TikTok? While other countries such as Indonesia have imposed temporary bans on TikTok, the biggest country that continues to prohibit the use of the app is India. India permanently banned TikTok along with more than 50 other Chinese apps after a deadly border dispute with China, citing national security concerns. National bans in other countries have not lasted more than, at most, a few months. Should we be more worried about TikTok than other apps? It depends on whom you ask. Several digital privacy and civil advocacy groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Fight for the Future say while the potential for China to exploit access to TikTok is indeed concerning, other apps and services offer government entities, including in the US, similar access to user data. “Unless we’re also [going to] ban Twitter and Facebook and YouTube and Uber and Grubhub, this is pointless,” said the Fight for the Future director, Evan Greer. “Yes, it’s possibly a bit easier for the Chinese government to gain access to data through TikTok than other apps, but there’s just so many ways governments can get data from apps.” But lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have introduced bills and applauded efforts to limit the use of TikTok. In addition to Hawley’s bill, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida introduced a bill to ban the company from operating in the US entirely. “This isn’t about creative videos – this is about an app that is collecting data on tens of millions of American children and adults every day,” Rubio said in a press release announcing the bipartisan bill. The Democratic senator Mark Warner of Virginia has also encouraged efforts to ban TikTok on government devices and called for more states to “take action to keep our government technology out of the CCP’s [Chinese Communist party’s] reach”. What are the geopolitical implications of this ban? The US has ramped up its efforts to address potential national security concerns from China over the last few years, including adding more China-based companies and entities to a commerce department blacklist limiting exports to those firms. The focus on TikTok is part of this larger campaign, but some groups warn that a ban on TikTok would lead to similar moves from China. “Blanket bans on apps based on a company’s foreign ownership will only hurt US businesses in the long run because countries could seek to block US online services over similar national security concerns,” said Gillian Diebold, a policy analyst at the Center for Data Innovation. Like other privacy advocates, Diebold said that “policymakers should pursue more promising solutions that address the underlying risks. “For example, to address data concerns, lawmakers should prioritize passing federal privacy legislation to protect consumer data that would explicitly require companies to disclose who they share data with and hold them accountable for those statements,” Diebold said. Could the US ever ban TikTok outright? There have been several attempts at banning TikTok from operating in the US entirely. Rubio’s bill, for instance, would block all of the company’s commercial operations in the US. But the viability of such bans have yet to be proved. Trump’s previous attempt to ban new users from downloading TikTok was blocked in court in part due to free speech concerns. The EFF general counsel, Kurt Opsahl, said a total ban is a violation of free speech and while Rubio’s bill and similar proposed laws to ban TikTok purportedly “protect America from China’s authoritarian government”, they actually adopt “one of the hallmarks of the Chinese internet strategy”. “A government is within its rights to set rules and restrictions on use of official devices it owns, but trying to ban TikTok from public use is something else entirely,” Opsahl said. “TikTok’s security, privacy and its relationship with the Chinese government is indeed concerning, but a total ban is not the answer,” he continued. “A total ban is not narrowly tailored to the least restrictive means to address the security and privacy concerns, and instead lays a censorial blow against the speech of millions of ordinary Americans.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/30/explainer-us-congress-tiktok-ban
85,tiktok,Guardian,2022-12-30,US bans China-based TikTok app on all federal government devices,"TikTok has been banned on all federal government devices in the US, with limited exceptions, after Joe Biden signed a $1.7tn (£1.4tn) spending bill on Thursday containing a provision that outlaws the China-based app over growing security concerns. The ban – which was approved by Congress in a vote last week – is a major step targeting the fastest-growing social media platform in the world as opponents express worry user data stored in China could be accessed by the government. Various government agencies will develop rules for implementing the ban over the next two months. It will mean that federal government employees are required to remove TikTok from their government-issued devices unless they are using the app for national security or law enforcement activities. It follows a flurry of legislative action against the platform in the US, after more than a dozen governors have issued similar orders prohibiting state employees from using TikTok on state-owned devices. Earlier this week, Congress passed legislation to ban TikTok on devices issued to members of the House of Representatives. Meanwhile, there has been a push to ban TikTok outright in the US, with legislation introduced by Senator Marco Rubio earlier this month to “ban Beijing-controlled TikTok for good”. That bill echoes moves from the previous administration, after Donald Trump issued an executive order in August 2020 prohibiting US companies from doing business with TikTok’s parent company ByteDance. The order was later revoked by Biden in June 2021 under the condition that the US committee on foreign investment (CFIUS) conducted a security review of the platform and suggested a path forward. In a statement, TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter said that the CFIUS agreement, which is still under review, would “meaningfully address any security concerns that have been raised at both the federal and state level”. “We’re disappointed that Congress has moved to ban TikTok on government devices—a political gesture that will do nothing to advance national security interests—rather than encouraging the Administration to conclude its national security review,” she said. Although ByteDance is based in China, the company has long claimed all US user data is stored in data centers in Virginia and backed up in Singapore. But political pressure began to build anew after BuzzFeed reported in June that China-based ByteDance employees had accessed US TikTok user data multiple times between September 2021 and January 2022. Legislators have expressed concern that the Chinese Communist party could manipulate young users with pro-China content on its algorithmic home page and access sensitive user data. “TikTok, their parent company ByteDance, and other China-based tech companies are required by Chinese law to share their information with the Communist party,” Senator Mark Warner said in July when calling for further investigation of the platform. “Allowing access to American data, down to biometrics such as face prints and voice prints, poses a great risk to not only individual privacy but to national security,” he added. The legislative pressure on TikTok comes as the app has exploded in popularity in recent years, amassing a user base of more than 1 billion after reporting a 45% increase in monthly active users between July 2020 and July 2022. In 2022 it became the most downloaded app in the world, quietly surpassing longstanding forebears Instagram and Twitter. With the meteoric rise has come broad concerns about the app’s impact on its relatively young users. Nearly half of people between 18 and 30 in the US use the platform, a recent Pew Research Center report showed – and 67% of users between the ages of 13 and 18 use the app daily.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/30/us-tiktok-ban-government-devices-china
86,tiktok,Guardian,2022-12-28,TikTok banned on devices issued by US House of Representatives,"TikTok has been banned from any devices issued by the US House of Representatives, as political pressure continues to build on the Chinese-owned social video app. The order to delete the app was issued by Catherine Szpindor, the chief administrative officer (CAO) of the House, whose office had warned in August that the app represented a “high risk to users”. According to a memo obtained by NBC News, all lawmakers and staffers with House-issued mobile phones have been ordered to remove TikTok by Szpindor. “House staff are NOT allowed to download the TikTok app on any House mobile devices,” NBC quoted the memo as saying. “If you have the TikTok app on your House mobile device, you will be contacted to remove it.” The move was also reported by Reuters. In a statement the US house of representatives confirmed the ban, saying “we can confirm that the Committee on House Administration has authorized the CAO Office of Cybersecurity to initiate the removal of TikTok Social Media Service from all House-managed devices.” In August the CAO issued a “cyber advisory” labelling TikTok a high-risk app due to its “lack of transparency in how it protects customer data”. It said TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, “actively harvests content for identifiable data” and stores some user data in China. TikTok says its data is not held in China, but in the US and Singapore. The CAO move comes amid multiple attempts to restrict the use of TikTok by government and state employees. Last week Congress passed a $1.7tn spending bill, which includes a provision banning TikTok from government devices. The ban will take effect once President Joe Biden signs the legislation into law. According to Reuters, at least 19 US states have partially blocked the app from state-managed devices over security concerns. In a statement released after the Congress ban, TikTok said the move was a “political gesture that will do nothing to advance national security interests”. This month the US senator Marco Rubio, a former Republican presidential contender, unveiled a legislative proposal to ban TikTok from the US entirely. Rubio said it was time to “ban Beijing-controlled TikTok for good”. Biden has revoked presidential orders targeting TikTok issued by his predecessor, Donald Trump, which included requiring TikTok to sell its US business. However, the US Committee on Foreign Investment, which scrutinises business deals with non-US companies, is also conducting a security review of TikTok. According to a recent Reuters report, TikTok is offering to operate more of its US business at arm’s length and subject it to outside scrutiny. The office of the House’s chief administrative officer and TikTok have been approached for comment.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/28/tiktok-banned-on-devices-issued-by-us-house-of-representatives

88,tiktok,Guardian,2022-12-25,Professor sues TikTok accuser for linking her to Idaho students’ murders,"A University of Idaho professor has filed a defamation lawsuit against a self-proclaimed psychic on TikTok after the tarot card reader accused her of killing four of the school’s students, whose murders shocked the US last month. The federal lawsuit filed by the university’s history department chair Rebecca Scofield on Wednesday alleges that TikTok user Ashley Guillard spread baseless claims which falsely linked the professor to the 13 November slayings of Xana Kernodle, 20; Ethan Chapin, 20; Maddie Mogen, 21; and Kaylee Goncalves, 21, in Moscow, Idaho. “Ashley Guillard – a purported internet sleuth – decided to use the community’s pain for her online self-promotion,” the lawsuit seeking damages said of Guillard, whom Scofield has never met before. Guillard has sought to take credit for solving other high-profile murders, including that of musician Takeoff, the third member of the rap group Migos. “She has posted many videos on TikTok falsely stating plaintiff Rebecca Scofield … participated in the murders because she was romantically involved with one of the victims,” the lawsuit added. “Guillard’s statements are false. Professor Scofield did not participate in the murders, and she had never met any of the victims, let alone entered a romantic relationship with them.” Guillard’s TikTok account – which states “Ashley is God” in the bio – features dozens of videos in which she hypothesizes over the killings, often through tarot card readings. Guillard claims that Scofield had been romantically involved with one of the students and ordered their murders in attempts to hide the relationship, according to the lawsuit. In one of the videos, Guillard wrote: “I don’t care what y’all say … REBECCA WAS THE ONE TO INITIATE THE PLAN.” In another video, Guillard said: “Rebecca Scofield is going to prison for the murder of the 4 University of Idaho Students whether you like it or not.” The lawsuit recounts how Scofield was with her husband in Portland, Oregon, visiting friends when the students were murdered. “Guillard’s videos have been viewed millions of times, amplifying Guillard’s online persona at the expense of professor Scofield’s reputation,” said the lawsuit, which states that none of the victims ever took a class with Scofield. “She does not recall ever meeting any one of these students,” the lawsuit said. It added: “She does not know why Guillard picked her to repeatedly falsely accuse of ordering the tragic murders and being involved with one of the victims. Professor Scofield does know that she has been harmed by the false TikToks and false statements.” On 29 November, a lawyer sent a cease and desist letter to Guillard on behalf of Scofield. Guillard continued to post videos accusing Scofield of the murders in Moscow. On 8 December, a second cease and desist letter was sent, asking Guillard to take down her “defamatory posts”, the lawsuit said. “Rather than change her conduct, Guillard made a TikTok showing the cease-and-desist letter … and explaining that if professor Scofield, through counsel, believed that Guillard was making false statements, counsel would need to ‘file actual legal documents in a federal court … asking me to remove it’.” Scofield’s lawsuit describes how she fears that she and her family could be targeted with physical violence. Guillard has since released several TikToks in response to the lawsuit, including one in which Guillard taunts Scofield by stating: “I’m ON FIRE with excitement! SEE YOU IN COURT REBECCA SCOFIELD!!” In another video, Guillard writes: “You sure you want to do this Rebecca SCOFIELD? This isn’t going to end well for you.” So far, no suspects have been arrested or even publicly identified in the case, leaving the university community on edge. A Moscow police statement from earlier this month warned against “speculation, without factual backing, [that is] stoking community fears and spreading false facts”. “We encourage referencing official releases for accurate information,” it said. The relative of one person who was considered a person of interest in the case – but has since been cleared as a suspect – spoke about how difficult the rampant speculation has been. The aunt of Jack DuCoeur, the ex-boyfriend of Kaylee Goncalves, told the New York Post her nephew “not only lost the love of his life, and what we all thought and he probably thought as well, would be his future wife – you know, get married and have kids and all of that”. But also, the aunt – Brooke Miller – said, “half of America” thinks DuCoeur could “be responsible” for the murders, particularly online users. Guillard has been among those to insist on calling DuCoeur a potential suspect and that he somehow may have been involved in the murders despite the police clearing him. • This article was amended on 26 December 2022. An earlier version incorrectly referred to Scofield instead of Guillard in relation to the second cease and desist letter and in the attribution of a video quote.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/25/tiktok-sleuth-ashley-guillard-rebecca-scofield-defamation-idaho-murders
89,tiktok,Guardian,2022-12-15,TikTok self-harm study results ‘every parent’s nightmare’,"TikTok’s recommendation algorithm pushes self-harm and eating disorder content to teenagers within minutes of them expressing interest in the topics, research suggests. The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) found that the video-sharing site will promote content including dangerously restrictive diets, pro-self-harm content and content romanticising suicide to users who show a preference for the material, even if they are registered as under-18s. For its study the campaign group set up accounts in the US, UK, Canada and Australia, registered with ages of 13, the minimum age for joining the service. It created “standard” and “vulnerable” accounts, the latter containing the term “loseweight” in their usernames, which CCDH said reflected research showing that social media users who seek out eating disorder content often choose usernames containing related language. The accounts “paused briefly” on videos about body image, eating disorders and mental health, and also liked them. This took place over a 30-minute initial period when the accounts launched, in an attempt to capture the effectiveness of TikTok’s algorithm that recommends content to users. On “standard” accounts, content about suicide followed within nearly three minutes and eating disorder material was shown within eight minutes. “The results are every parent’s nightmare,” said Imran Ahmed, CCDH’s chief executive. “Young people’s feeds are bombarded with harmful, harrowing content that can have a significant cumulative impact on their understanding of the world around them, and their physical and mental health.” The group said the majority of mental health videos presented to its standard accounts via the For You feed – the main way TikTok users experience the app – consisted of users sharing their anxieties and insecurities. Body image content was more harmful, the report said, with accounts registered for 13-year-olds being shown videos advertising weight loss drinks and “tummy-tuck” surgery. One animation that appeared in front of the standard accounts carried a piece of audio stating “I’ve been starving myself for you” and had more than 100,000 likes. The report said the accounts were shown self-harm or eating disorder videos every 206 seconds. The researchers found that videos relating to body image, mental health and eating disorders were shown to “vulnerable” accounts three times more than to standard accounts. The vulnerable accounts received 12 times as many recommendations for self-harm and suicide-related videos as the standard accounts, the report said. The recommended content was more extreme for the vulnerable accounts, including methods of self-harm and young people discussing plans to kill themselves. CCDH said a mental health or body image-related video was shown every 27 seconds, although the content was dominated by mental health videos, which CCDH defined as videos about anxieties, insecurities and mental health conditions, excluding eating disorders, self-harm and suicide. The group said its research did not differentiate between content with a positive intent – such as content discovering recovery – or negative content. A spokesperson for TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese firm ByteDance and has more than 1 billion users worldwide, said the CCDH study did not reflect the experience or viewing habits of real-life users of the app. “We regularly consult with health experts, remove violations of our policies and provide access to supportive resources for anyone in need,” they said. “We’re mindful that triggering content is unique to each individual and remain focused on fostering a safe and comfortable space for everyone, including people who choose to share their recovery journeys or educate others on these important topics.” TikTok’s guidelines ban content that promotes behaviour that could lead to suicide and self-harm, as well as material that promotes unhealthy eating behaviours or habits. The UK’s online safety bill proposes requiring social networks to take action against so-called “legal but harmful” content being shown to children. A DCMS spokesperson said “We are putting a stop to unregulated social media causing harm to our children. Under the Online Safety Bill, tech platforms will need to prevent under-18s from being exposed to illegal content assisting suicide and protect them from other harmful or age-inappropriate material, including the promotion of self-harm and eating disorders, or face huge fines.” • In the UK, the youth suicide charity Papyrus can be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or email pat@papyrus-uk.org.

90,tiktok,Guardian,2022-12-09,Squishmallows go from TikTok sensation to top Christmas toy,"Times are tough and budgets are squeezed, so it is perhaps no surprise that the runaway success story in Toyland this Christmas is Squishmallows, the squidgy, huggable pillows-with-a-face that became a viral sensation on TikTok. The £8 toys are flying off retailers’ shelves with UK sales up 300% this year and stores on track to sell 4m. This pattern is being repeated around the world as total Squishmallows sales doubled in less than a year to surpass 200m this summer – a success story that Frédérique Tutt, toy expert at market researchers NPD, said reflected the staggering “power of social media”. For the uninitiated, Squishmallows are a line of whimsical, stuffed creatures. They can be fruit, vegetable or animal or, in keeping with this quirky world, a hybrid – think pug dressed as watermelon or penguin in a pineapple costume. They rose to prominence on social media as fans – the toys are particularly popular with teenage girls – shared their collections online, resulting in more than 9bn video views on TikTok alone. This was aided by famous devotees such as Kim Kardashian, Lady Gaga and the US social media star Charli D’Amelio posting about the toys to their huge numbers of followers. Tutt said Squishmallows united several big consumer trends including wellness and collecting. “It is a bit of ‘cuddles’,” she said of the sensory appeal of the supersoft, cushionlike toys. “People are also collecting more than ever, we see that in our data with things like Pokémon and Panini stickers. Pull those things together and add the power of social media, and Squishmallows became a viral sensation.” Launched in 2017, there are now 3,000 Squishmallow designs, each with a unique name and biography, a facet that stokes their appeal for collectors who seek out characters they relate to. For example Cam the Cat, one the US brand’s first characters, likes skateboarding, the beach and cat naps. Gerhard Runken, the senior vice-president of brand and marketing at Jazwares, which owns Squishmallows, said the low-priced toys struck a chord during the Covid era when people were spending more time at home and needed a “little hug or something soft to play with”. The toys are popular with children and adults who relate to them in different ways, he said. “Squishmallows are fun to have around the house, you can collect them, they’re fun to sleep with, lay on, and share,” said Runken of the toys, which range in size from 18cm to 50cm, with the largest ones selling for £50 to £60. “While we don’t say in our brand statement that we are a mental health pillow, we embrace how they help people.” One of the most appealing things about the toys is how they feel, he said. They are covered in a special stretchy fabric while the filling, which utilises recycled plastic bottles, feels like a marshmallow. “We process it more than other people’s fillings and it really gives us that cloud-type feel,” explained Runken. Even the legendary investor Warren Buffett is a collector, in a sense. His Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate recently bought the investment company that owns Jazwares. The Squishmallows brand has big plans for the future as it moves beyond toys into new product areas such as clothing, bedding and stationery. The Entertainer toy chain said it would sell 1m of the toys this year. “Squishmallows has been phenomenal,” said its founder, Gary Grant. “You see people touching, pulling and stretching them. It is not just any soft toy, it is very cuddly and tactile. “The other thing that we’ve noticed is the age group appeal is much wider than children. Where we’ve got shops in university towns and cities, we’ve had university students buying them. It’s bonkers but that’s what is happening.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/09/squishmallows-go-from-tiktok-sensation-to-top-christmas-toy
91,tiktok,Guardian,2022-12-09,Is TikTok killing off the pop music bridge?,"Back in March, the Australian singer Hatchie tweeted: “Why are pop songs with a bridge a dying breed?” She wasn’t the only one pondering that question; it was a sentiment that would be echoed in a post by the TikTok musician Boy Jr in August, who – to the tune of Video Killed the Radio Star – told her 300,000 followers that the very platform she was posting from had, along with streaming services and algorithms, “killed the bridge in pop songs”. In another TikTok post that garnered 100,000 likes in November, user, R00keries wrote “shoutout to every artist that still writes bridges in their songs … they’re the best part and I hate that they’re going away”. Indeed, if you have listened to pop music at all in the past few years, you may have noticed that something is missing. The bridge – that part of the song where verse and chorus give way to an alternate section that ramps up the tension (or the fun) – is seemingly on the wane. Where a big, barnstorming section – perhaps complete with an epic key change, a la Céline Dion’s My Heart Will Go On or, er, Avril Lavigne’s Sk8er Boi – may have once been de rigueur, these days you often just get another verse or a moody final chorus. Bridge-free hits of recent years have included the country-inspired smash Old Town Road by Lil Nas X, Gayle’s pop-punk breakout single ABCDEFU, and Harry Styles’s Late Night Talking, whose muzak-y R&amp;B sound largely loops for its three-minute running time. Of all of the UK No 1 singles in 2022, only a handful have a definitive bridge – among them Kate Bush’s 1985 hit Running Up That Hill, which found viral success again thanks to Stranger Things. On his heartstring-tugging single Forget Me, Lewis Capaldi offers a redo of the chorus, and even Taylor Swift – often acclaimed as the contemporary queen of the bridge by pop fans (and Time magazine), for tracks such as All Too Well and Cruel Summer – opted for a third verse on her No 1 single Anti-Hero, rather than going into full-on key-change mode. It is a trend that hasn’t gone unnoticed by those in the know, with none other than Sting calling out the seeming dearth of bridges in a 2021 interview with the music producer and YouTuber Rick Beato. “The structure is slightly simpler now … it’s more minimalist,” he said. “The bridge has disappeared. For me, the bridge is therapy … the structure is therapy. In modern music, most of it, you’re in a circular trap … You’re not getting that release.” But is the bridge actually disappearing, and is TikTok – with its short, meme-heavy format – to blame? Twenty-year-old Caity Baser is a singer-songwriter from Southampton who started uploading her music to the social media app during lockdown, inspired by the likes of Kate Nash, Rizzle Kicks and her own dating dramas, and has since gone on to sign with EMI. “I was really stressed about going to uni, and having no money,” she says. “So I wrote a song about it [Average Student]. I almost deleted it, but then I turned my phone back on and it had half a million views …” For Baser, it is unlikely that artists are specifically ditching bridges to appeal to the site’s users (“I won’t not put a bridge in because I’m like: ‘Oh, TikTok won’t like it.’ I love a bridge”), but rather that pop songs themselves are getting shorter, leading artists to be more concise. “I think [shorter songs] are a bit of a clever thing,” she says. “You want to hear them again; you want to play them again.” It is a sentiment shared by Sophia Ikirmawi, a London-based music publicist. “Songs are definitely shorter but it’s not just for TikTok, it’s for streaming,” she says. “If you have an album full of shorter songs, people can play through the album more quickly, and your sales will go up.” It is difficult to know exactly which parts of a song might go viral on an app such as TikTok which, in turn, could tempt artists to adopt more repetitive song structures, but Ikirmawi warns against generalisations. “I don’t know how much people are thinking about TikTok,” she says. “It’s difficult to know what will go viral. Look at how random songs like an Abba track or [That’s Not My Name by] the Ting Tings can blow up on there … you’d be foolish to change a song just to try and go viral.” Ikirmawi cites Harry Styles’s As It Was, for example – with its “Leave America” line which crowds screamed at the singer on tour as an unsubtle protest against him spending so much of his time in the US – as proof that the bridge still has potential to jostle out a singalong chorus for attention. Olivia Rodrigo’s Drivers License, released in 2021, is another example that goes against the grain, with its “Red lights / Stop signs” crescendo arguably the most memorable part of the song. “There’s a generation of pop singers who have grown up with Taylor Swift, and are obsessed with [her sound],” says Ikirmawi of Rodrigo and contemporaries such as Maisie Peters and Griff, both of whom are also partial to a bridge. For Charlie Harding, co-host of the Vulture podcast Switched on Pop, the “bridge or no bridge” question is inextricably linked with the evolution of music itself. “Song form in general is changing,” he says. “People are experimenting more and more. Bridges go back to classical pop, when you had to give the listener some kind of reprieve to earn your final section. There are probably a few reasons why people don’t feel compelled to write a bridge today. One of those is certainly a long disconnect from classical pop, and songs have been getting shorter for a long time.” Harding adds that the ubiquity of software-made music based around eight- to 16-bar loops can make a bridge “difficult to write, because you’ve built your whole song around this loop, and now you need to generate completely new material. Frankly it might be too much of a deviation.” Besides, who is to say what a bridge is now anyway? For Harding, Swift’s third Anti-Hero verse fulfils the same brief of dipping the energy before a final build up, even if it sounds more like a verse or a “down chorus” (the stripped-back, energy-free version of a refrain you hear just before a triumphant finale). He does, however, reject the idea that music is becoming simpler overall. While there may be “more things that stay in common” throughout a song, in the form of chord loops, Harding sees it as “leaning into a different musical language … Today you have layers upon layers of unique sounds that can make a four-bar chord loop really interesting, with new things constantly happening. I’m very hesitant to say that things have become simpler or we’ve become dumber; it’s just that different things are taking precedence.” It seems, ultimately, that bridges are not going away for good but merely evolving, or taking on new forms in the age of streaming and social media virality. And, even if you may be hearing fewer of them right now, that doesn’t mean that music is necessarily worse for it. “Look at Jolene by Dolly Parton,” says Baser. “No bridge – and it’s a smash. There’s no right or wrong.”",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/09/pop-music-is-tiktok-killing-the-bridge
92,tiktok,Guardian,2022-12-08,Texas bans TikTok on government devices amid China data-sharing fears,"Governor Greg Abbott of Texas on Wednesday ordered state agencies to ban TikTok on government-issued devices, citing security concerns of the app’s data-sharing practices with the Chinese government. “TikTok harvests vast amounts of data from its users’ devices – including when, where and how they conduct Internet activity – and offers this trove of potentially sensitive information to the Chinese government,” according to one of the letters the governor sent to state agency leaders. “While TikTok has claimed that it stores US data within the US, the company admitted in a letter to Congress that China-based employees can have access to US data. It has also been reported that ByteDance planned to use TikTok location information to surveil individual American citizens,” it added. The letter also cited China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law, stating that businesses are required to assist China in intelligence work including data sharing. It recounted that TikTok’s algorithm had already censored topics politically sensitive to the Chinese Communist party, including the Tiananmen Square protests. Several other Republican lawmakers across the country have implemented similar TikTok bans. Indiana’s attorney general went a step further and sued the social media app, claiming the video-sharing platform misleads its users, particularly children, about the level of inappropriate content and security of consumer information. Todd Rokita claimed in the complaint filed on Wednesday that while TikTok says it is safe for users 13 years and older, the app contains “salacious and inappropriate content” available to young users “for unlimited periods of time, day and night, in an effort to line TikTok’s pockets with billions of dollars from US consumers”. As part of Abbott’s order, state agency leaders are required to immediately ban its employees from downloading and using the app on any government-issued device including cellphones, laptops, tablets, desktop computers and “other devices capable of Internet connectivity”. In addition, Abbott announced a direct joint action by the state’s department of public safety and department of information resources to address the app’s “vulnerabilities” on personal devices by 15 January 2023. Every state agency will then be given a month to set its own policy regarding the use of the app on employees’ personal devices. Abbott’s order follows in the footsteps of Maryland’s governor, Larry Hogan, who on Tuesday also ordered the ban of Tiktok and several other China and Russia-based platforms in the state’s executive government branch. “There may be no greater threat to our personal safety and our national security than the cyber vulnerabilities that support our daily lives,” Hogan, a Republican, said in a statement, adding: “To further protect our systems, we are issuing this emergency directive against foreign actors and organizations that seek to weaken and divide us.” Similarly, Wisconsin’s Republican representatives in Congress on Tuesday called on Governor Tony Evers to delete TikTok from all state government devices, calling it a national security threat. “Wisconsinites expect their governor to be aware of the dangerous national security threats TikTok poses and to protect them from this avenue for CCP intelligence operations,” said Senator Ron Johnson and the representatives Mike Gallagher, Tom Tiffany, Glenn Grothman, Bryan Steil and Scott Fitzgerald said in a letter. The Maryland directive comes a week after South Dakota’s governor, Kristi Noem, also a Republican, banned state employees and contractors from accessing TikTok on state-owned devices, citing its ties to China. Similarly, the South Carolina governor, Henry McMaster, on Monday asked the state’s department of administration to ban TikTok from all state government devices it manages. Nebraska’s governor, Pete Ricketts, blocked TikTok on state electronic devices in August 2020. In response, TikTok said that the recent slew of bans “are largely fueled by misinformation about our company”. “We are always happy to meet with state policymakers to discuss our privacy and security practices,” TikTok spokesperson Jamal Brown told the Associated Press. “We are disappointed that the many state agencies, offices, and universities that have been using TikTok to build communities and connect with constituents will no longer have access to our platform.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/07/texas-bans-tiktok-government-devices-china-data-sharing-fears
93,tiktok,Guardian,2022-12-02,Twitter and TikTok could be called to negotiate under Australia’s news media code,"Social media sites like TikTok and Twitter could be assessed for whether they should pay news companies for content, under recommendations from the Treasury’s review of the news media bargaining code. In its first year of operation, the code was a success, facilitating 23 agreements between Google and news publishers, and 13 agreements between Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, and news publishers, according to a Treasury report released on Thursday. Andrew Forrest’s Minderoo Foundation also helped negotiate an agreement with the platforms representing 24 publishers in May this year. Publishers including Guardian Australia and Nine said that in the absence of the code, there would not have been meaningful licensing negotiations with the platforms. The ABC said it used the funding to appoint 57 regional positions, including reporters in 19 locations, 10 of which did not previously have them. Under the code implemented by the former Coalition government, the treasurer can designate a digital platform’s involvement and that would bring on strict rules around negotiations with news publishers. So far no digital platform has been designated – the Morrison government was able to leverage the threat of the code being applied to bring Meta and Google to the table. But this has meant some news publications have not been able to negotiate with the companies and other digital platforms such as TikTok and Twitter have not been included. Treasury recommended the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) conduct periodic inquiries into what other platforms should be included. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Media companies have already suggested expanding the code. In a submission to an ACCC review of social media, Nine said TikTok had a “rapidly growing and unfair market power” and was an “unavoidable business partner” for news in Australia, meaning it should be covered by the code. The report noted that some of the clauses in existing agreements would end the contracts should the digital platforms be designated under the code, meaning the news companies would not receive whatever outstanding funding had yet to be paid. Google’s director of government affairs and public policy, Lucinda Longcroft, said Google’s contribution to the news industry in Australia now covered 70 Australian news businesses, representing 200 mastheads, the majority of which were local or regional. Many of Google’s agreements run for five years, while all of Meta’s agreements run for three years. The shorter run for Meta’s agreements raises questions about whether the company will come to the table with a new agreement when the deals expire. Meta cut a number of roles from its Australian news team as part of a global restructure last month that saw 11,000 people leave the company. The company had already indicated its plan to end in-house curation of Facebook news in Australia by 2021. Meta declined to comment on the Treasury report, but in a response to the cuts announcement last month, its Australia and New Zealand managing director, Will Easton, indicated the company’s focus had shifted. “While we have maintained news partnerships resources in Australia, user preferences have shifted to creator-driven content in products such as Watch and Reels, and this is where we will focus moving forward.” The Treasury report has recommended a review of the code after four years of operation. The Public Interest Journalism Initiative criticised this proposal, however, saying it would be after many of the deals have expired. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, and the assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, said they would consider the recommendations of the report. Jones said the platforms “must continue to negotiate in good faith with news businesses to ensure they are fairly remunerated for the news content they create”.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/02/twitter-and-tiktok-could-be-called-to-negotiate-under-australias-news-media-code

There were iconic scenes at Melbourne’s Federation Square, prompting envy in the harbour city where no such live site exists. That will be remedied for this Sunday’s Socceroos clash with Argentina, with the New South Wales government announcing it will set up a live site in the Sydney CBD – specific location TBD. The victory was a heartfelt tale for player Bailey Wright, who shortly after leaving the field received a text from his wife about the condition of his seriously ill mother-in-law. “I’ve just come in from a message from my wife,” Wright said. “I just want to dedicate this to my wife – bless her – and her mum. I’ll be honest, I’m not sure if she’s still with us.” Top news Christine McVie dies | The voice behind Fleetwood Mac classics including Everywhere and Don’t Stop has “passed away peacefully” following a short illness. She was 79 years old. Tributes have flowed from across the music industry, with sometimes fellow band member and Crowded House frontman, Neil Finn, calling McVie a “supremely gifted songwriter and a warm and wonderful friend”. Concussion in sport | An inquiry proposed by the Greens with Labor and Coalition support will examine concussion and repeated head trauma in contact sports at all levels, for all genders and age groups. It comes amid growing concern about chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a disease which former AFL concussion doctor Paul McCrory has been accused of downplaying the risks of. Medibank hacker’s data dump | The cyber-criminals behind the Medibank hack have declared “case closed” after posting a file on the dark web that looks to be the remainder of the customer data they acquired. The health insurer said it was in the process of analysing the data but that it “appears to be the data we believed the criminal stole”. TikTok tanning ban | The social media company will ban videos that encourage tanning and add educational content to its platform in its place, after concerns raised by Australian medical experts. In September, Melanoma Institute Australia co-medical directors, Prof Georgina Long and Prof Richard Scolyer, took issue with the app for its popular #sunburnchallenge hashtag. Emissions target falling short | Australia is on track for a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030, short of the 43% target set by the Albanese government. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said the projection is still an improvement on the Morrison government, when projections “were at only 30%”. “That is, we’ve lifted the outlook by a third in just our first six months,” Bowen said. US railroad strike | The House of Representatives voted to approve a bill to block a railroad strike, after president Joe Biden called on Congress to intervene, warning the strike would “devastate our economy”. The sticking point is a demand for sick pay, which is not provided to workers. Progressive pushback in support of worker demands resulted in a second House vote to mandate sick pay, but it’s unclear whether that will pass the Senate. China economy worries | As well as prompting social unrest, there are signs China’s zero-Covid strategy is throttling the world’s second largest economy. China’s GDP is forecast to grow by 3.2% this year, well below the official target of 5.5%. This would make 2022 the slowest year for GDP growth in more than 40 years, excluding the Covid-affected rate in 2020. The IMF said this forecast could be cut even further. Iranian shot dead | Mehran Samak, 27, was shot dead by security forces after honking his car horn in celebration of Iran’s exit from the World Cup. Samak “was targeted directly and shot in the head by security forces … following the defeat of the national team against America”, the Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights said.

95,tiktok,Guardian,2022-12-01,TikTok to ban videos that encourage sunburn and tanning after alarm from medical experts,"Social media giant TikTok has announced it will actively ban videos that encourage tanning and add educational content to its platform after alarm from Australian medical experts over the platform’s sharing of pro-tanning material. In September, Melanoma Institute Australia co-medical directors Prof Georgina Long and Prof Richard Scolyer, speaking at the National Press Club, took issue with the video-sharing app for its popular #sunburnchallenge hashtag. Speaking alongside Olympian and melanoma survivor Cate Campbell, Long warned social media influencers were glamorising tanning with hashtags like “sunburnt tanlines”, which had more than 200m views. She urged platforms, television stations and influencers to “change the cultural narrative around sunburn and tanning” in Australia, which, alongside New Zealand, has the highest skin cancer incidence and mortality rate in the world. In response to the backlash, TikTok has announced a widespread education campaign that will impose a pop-up banner for an anti-tanning content – and for all searches around tanning, summer and sunburn. The campaign, targeting people between 20 and 39, will also remove “concerning content” related to “dangerous” tanning activities, including the popular #sunburnchallenge hashtag, which has more than 8.4m views worldwide. The TikTok trend encourages users to post videos of their most painful, blistering sunburns, “awkward tan-lines” and peeling skin for dramatic effect, with tips on reducing the severity of a burn. TikTok’s general manager in Australia and New Zealand, Lee Hunter, said the platform would encourage user-generated content about sun safety and the dangers of melanoma among young people. Melanoma is the most common form of cancer among 20 to 39-year-olds in Australia and the nation’s most deadly form of skin cancer, accounting for more than 1,000 deaths a year. Cancer Australia estimates 17,756 new cases of melanoma of the skin will be diagnosed in 2022, making it the third most common cancer nationwide behind prostate cancer and breast cancer. “We’ll actively promote the creator content related to the campaign, which means everyone aged between 20 and 39 will see the message,” Hunter said. “And everyone who searches for a hashtag related to summer sun, tanning and many other summer time phrases will see the … banner and will be provided with information that outlines the dangers of tanning.” The platform’s first video features youthful Australian influencer “starr” lathering sunscreen on a beach and dismissing tanning to her alter ego as “cooked”. The Melanoma Institute Australia chief executive, Matthew Browne, said it had been lobbying the social media platform for months to curb concerning content on its platform, which could influence young and susceptible social media users. Thirty-two per cent 32% of the platform’s users are between 16 and 24. “Our medical directors put out a plea about the urgent need to stop the glamorisation of tanning, to save young lives, and we are delighted TikTok answered that call,” Browne said. “One Aussie is diagnosed with melanoma every 30 minutes and it claims more lives than the national road toll. Tanning is actually skin cells in trauma. “There is no safe way of sun tanning, including the concept of getting a protective ‘base tan’ at the start of summer.” The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president, Dr Nicole Higgins, said it was a “smart move” from TikTok amid the ongoing popularity for tanning among young people. “We are having enough difficulty discouraging patients, particularly young people, from tanning themselves and risking skin cancer without social media platforms making that job even harder,” she said. “We have the highest rates of skin cancer in the entire world, with more than 12,000 invasive melanoma diagnoses every single year. “I cut melanomas out of people very regularly, including young people … What may seem glamorous or appealing can actually be deadly.” TikTok has faced backlash in the past over viral challenges, including the “blackout challenge” where users to choked themselves until they passed out, and the “Benadryl challenge”, encouraging large intakes of antihistamines in an attempt to produce hallucinogenic effects.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/01/tiktok-to-ban-videos-that-encourage-sunburn-and-tanning-after-alarm-from-medical-experts
96,tiktok,Guardian,2022-11-27,How did he survive? PR and TikTok votes kept Matt Hancock in I’m a Celebrity jungle,"When Matt Hancock entered the I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! jungle, pundits predicted he would be the first to be voted out. His decision to appear on the ITV show, despite his record during the pandemic and the fact he is a sitting MP, had provoked anger and disgust. More than 1,700 people complained to Ofcom, the broadcast regulator, and the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group issued a searing statement. “The fact that he is trying to cash in on his terrible legacy, rather than showing some humility or seeking to reflect on the appalling consequences of his time in government, says it all about the sort of person he is,” a spokesperson said. But despite the criticism – or perhaps because of it – the former health secretary has won the backing of an unlikely crowd, lasting more than two weeks in the jungle and surviving eight eliminations to make it to the final today. Support from young TikTok users – boosted by a concerted effort from his PR team – appears to have been key to his on-screen success, according to public relations experts and political rivals. Over the past few days, before the final on ITV on Sunday evening, members of Hancock’s PR team were lobbying for votes on the app – encouraging people to vote for him repeatedly and giving them step-by-step instructions. One video, addressed to “team Matt”, said their mission was to “keep Matt in the jungle”. It added that they should “download the I’m a Celebrity... app and vote five times,” or call the voting number. “Always use all my votes to keep Matt in!” one TikTokker wrote in response. Another video was billed as a “step by step guide to keep Matt in the jungle” and showed someone scrolling through the app on their phone and voting for Hancock repeatedly. The TikTok campaign is not a breach of the rules: ITV’s website says viewers can vote up to five times each via the app, while those voting by text or phone can vote up to 600 times from a single number before it is deemed suspicious and unfair to the other contestants. But it is a deliberate strategy. Since 8 November, Hancock’s PR team has posted 24 videos of him on the app, all linked to his appearance in the jungle. He now has more than 77,000 followers and at least 511,800 likes across his official TikTok account, while videos of him overall have been watched 400 million times, according to TikTok’s internal data. Aside from Hollyoaks actor Owen Warner, the equivalent stats for other stars are far poorer. Former rugby player Mike Tindall, who was voted out last night, has less than 3,500 followers, with just over 26,000 likes, while what appears to be the official account for former England footballer Jill Scott, who was tipped as the favourite to win going into the final tonight, has about 2,180 followers and less than 900 likes. On Twitter and Instagram, the other I’m a Celebrity... contestants admittedly have a bigger presence. But it is TikTok – where videos have been promoted by the algorithm and hashtags such as #matthancockfanclub have gained traction – that has been so crucial for Hancock, said PR guru Mark Borkowski. “I think TikTok has been quite important to him. I think [users] see him as some sort of anomaly, something that is winding up the older generation, so why don’t we just play mischief?” Borkowski said. He added: “The people instructing him back in Blighty have done a very good job with TikTok. A lot of it is instructing the audience what to do, to use the app, how to vote for Matt. And that bit has been clever.” But software used by Borkowski’s team to track media coverage shows comments on articles and social media posts about Hancock, 44, are still largely negative. During his time as health secretary, the MP for West Suffolk oversaw the unlawful discharge of hospital patients into care homes at the height of the pandemic and broke transparency rules by failing to publish details of multibillion-pound government PPE contracts. He was subsequently forced to resign as health secretary after the Sun published footage of him kissing his aide Gina Coladangelo while social distancing rules were in place. While Borkowksi believes that the public’s view of Hancock remains dim, he says younger fans could help him win. He does not believe it will pay off, however. “I don’t think he has a political career after it. I think he’ll be ridiculed,” Borkowksi said. “He’s like a pantomime villain. I can see him doing odd advertising campaigns.” Ian Houlder, a Conservative councillor in Hancock’s West Suffolk seat, was equally scathing. He too believes Hancock’s success on the programme is down to younger audiences. “I think it’s down to demographics; it’s the Corbyn effect,” said Houlder, 73. He wants Hancock to resign but fears his TV stint will embolden him in future, and called on the local Conservative association to hold a membership vote on deselecting him. “What I hope is that he doesn’t come back thinking: ‘I’m the most famous person in England and I’m going to carry on as MP.’ I’ll go absolutely spare. It’s awful that he thinks he can just walk away from his constituency,” he said. Jo Hemmings, a behavioural and media psychologist, was more positive in her assessment. She said Hancock had defied expectations on the show by getting to the final and coming across as “someone who has more human qualities than perhaps they anticipated and as not such a bad guy after all”. She admits to being baffled by the sea change in public opinion – from him being seen as the face of pandemic mishandling, rule-breaking and death to being viewed as likable campmate - and believes it will have upended producers’ expectations. “They were playing with people’s minds by putting him in there. He clearly isn’t perceived as a villain of the piece. I think he was put in to fulfil that role,” she said. “He went in there to be laughed at, humiliated, punished and actually he has done well,” she added. “He’s getting out of it what he intended to get out of it.” Hancock’s team said he had been “working on constituency matters” in the jungle, adding that the programme’s“producers have agreed that Matt can communicate with his team if there’s an urgent constituency matter while he’s on the show”.“As soon as Matt’s time in camp is up, he will return to Suffolk to hold surgeries where he will catch up with his constituents and discuss matters of concern,” a spokesperson said. They said that he would be making a donation to a hospice and causes supporting dyslexia from his fee, although they have not yet said how much of the rumoured £400,000 will be given to charity.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/27/matt-hancock-im-a-celebrity-tiktok-votes-jungle
97,tiktok,Guardian,2022-11-18,Malaysia’s TikTok election: under-21s head to polls for first time,"Malaysians are voting in a tightly contested general election on Saturday, after two weeks of fierce campaigning in which politicians have sought to woo millions of young voters by embracing Instagram and TikTok trends. Saturday’s election is the first since constitutional changes lowered the voting age to 18 and automatically registered voters, meaning there are 6 million more voters than at the previous election in 2018. It is believed to be the first time people under 40 make up the majority of the electorate. More than 9,000 polling centres will open for 10 hours on Saturday but there is concern about voter turnout. On top of widespread flooding and forecasts of further rain, many voters are weary after years of political infighting. The government that won power in 2018 collapsed in less than two years, and the country has had three different prime ministers in four years. The current prime minister, Ismail Sabri Yaakob, of the UMNO party, called the snap election in October in an attempt to strengthen his Barisan Nasional (National Front) alliance. He is up against two other coalitions vying to form a government: Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope), led by the reformist opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, and Perikatan Nasional (National Alliance), led by the former prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin. UMNO had dominated Malaysian politics for decades, before it was ousted in the 2018 elections – a result driven by popular anger over the multibillion-dollar 1MDB financial scandal. Najib Razak, a former prime minister, was imprisoned recently for 12 years on charges related to 1MDB. Analysts say it is unlikely there will be a clear majority – which requires a minimum 112 of 222 parliamentary seats – after Saturday’s vote. “The question will be which coalition will have the bigger number of seats with a strong negotiating position,” said Dr Azmil Tayeb, a political analyst. A new battleground In the battle to win over first-time voters, politicians have embraced social media, with TikTok emerging as a new battleground in the race to secure youth votes. There are now 1.4 million 18- to 21-year-olds who are newly eligible to vote, out of a total voting population of 21.1 million. Muhyiddin Yassin, 75, the chair of Perikatan Nasional (PN), is among those to have tapped into TikTok trends during campaigning. In one video that has been liked hundreds of thousands of times, he swipes away the logos of rival political coalitions to the strains of the song Swipe by the Singaporean hip-hop artist Alyph. Syed Saddiq, who became Malaysia’s youngest minister after the 2018 elections, is especially active on social media, posting clips of campaign speeches, pleas for young people to vote – as well as clips of his two cats. In one video, he does 60 seconds of press-ups (the time it takes to register for postal voting) to persuade people how quick the process is. Divya Latha Ramesh, 23, a student and first-time voter, said that in the run-up to the election her social media feeds had been saturated with politics. “Recently all my fyp [For You page] recommendations are about politics,” she said. “Social media is a huge platform to attract young voters’ attention.” Divya Latha wants a government that will bring about a more equal society, reduce poverty and put an end to affirmative action policies that have for decades benefited the Malay majority over ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities in areas such as education. “I hope for a government that cares about its own people regardless of their race, age and skin colour,” she said. Raja Nur Arissa, 21, also voting for the first time, said while she had some friends who supported UMNO, young people were more likely to be conscious of the 1MDB scandal. “There are not many from the younger generation that still support [Najib],” she said. Arissa, a student and a social media influencer, said she wanted a government that cared about human rights, and that would take weather-related disasters seriously. Some of her friends were affected during recent flooding, not once but twice, due to failures of the government warning system, she said. She hopes that, soon, younger leaders could also emerge. “Although they say experience makes a great leader, we should also give a chance to the younger ones to prove that the next generation can be better. Many youth now are struggling to make a living.” Azmil, the analyst, said that on social media the three major coalitions had focused on promising stability and economic prosperity. “Especially for young people’s jobs, high cost of living, student debt, access to education, these are the typical promises. It resonates a bit more now as we have a global recession.” On the brink of power Anwar Ibrahim, the opposition leader and former deputy prime minister, has drawn huge turnouts at his events, according to Azmi Hassan, a senior fellow at Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research (NASR). But he said the atmosphere was more subdued than in 2018, when Anwar’s coalition benefited from huge public anger over the 1MDB scandal. Anwar has promised reforms such as limiting the prime minister’s term to 10 years, and making assistance needs-based rather that race-based. He has been on the brink of power several times during his turbulent political career . It was Anwar’s reformist coalition – an unlikely alliance formed with his former rival Mahathir Mohamad – that defeated Barisan Nasional in 2018. Mahathir had promised Anwar he would succeed him as prime minister, but he resigned from office before the promise could be fulfilled. Dr Oh Ei Sun, a political analyst and a senior fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, said loyalty among UMNO voters should not be underestimated this year. “I think a party such as UMNO has the ability, an uncanny ability, to mobilise their voters to still come out to vote, therefore flooding would benefit UMNO,” said Ei Sun.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/18/under-21s-given-vote-as-malaysia-goes-to-polls-in-tiktok-election
98,tiktok,Guardian,2022-11-17,TikTok to sell books directly to users via marketplace,"TikTok has proved to be a hugely successful way to promote books in recent years, with publishers attributing the popularity of books such as It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover and The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid in large part to recommendations on the app. Now TikTok has decided to sell books directly, announcing partnerships with publishers HarperCollins UK, WH Smith, Bloomsbury and bookshop.org, all of which will sell books via TikTok’s online marketplace. #BookTok is one of the social media platform’s most popular hashtags, reaching more than 90bn views to date, and as a result TikTok has formed several partnerships off the back of its success, including with the Hay festival and publisher Penguin Random House (PRH), where since September, app users have been able to tag any PRH title in their videos. However, these new partnerships mark the first time users have been able to buy books directly through TikTok. Any merchant signed up to TikTok Shop can advertise and sell products to users within the app. The marketplace has been gradually expanding to include fashion, consumer electronics, beauty and fresh and frozen goods – and now books. TikTok Shop’s senior director of e-commerce Patrick Nommensen, said: “It has been incredible to witness the BookTok community sharing its passion for reading, and reshaping the publishing world in the process.” He added: “With these new partnerships, we’re delighted to be making it even easier for book lovers to buy the latest BookTok recommendations without ever leaving the platform, while also providing new avenues for publishers both large and small to reach their audiences.” He also suggested that future publisher partnerships may be on the horizon, adding that he and his colleagues “look forward to welcoming more merchants on to TikTok Shop UK in the future, as our platform continues to evolve as the ultimate destination for books and literature.” Jo Surman, group digital and technology director at HarperCollins UK, said: “We’ve really enjoyed the last year working with TikTok and our authors to create content engaging with the thriving TikTok community.” Selling books through the app was “the natural next step”, she said. Meanwhile, Nicole Vanderbilt, managing director at bookshop.org, said: “We’re pleased to be partnering with TikTok Shop – not only to give BookTokers and their communities another way to buy from their local independent through bookshop.org, but also to help booksellers enhance their own BookTok skills.” The increased commercialisation of BookTok hasn’t always been received positively by TikTok users, however. When a TikTok book club was launched earlier this year, app user TheLibbyRuth said: “While I enjoy content created by businesses, I think the best part about TikTok is the authentic and unpolished aspect of it, and I would hate to see it become overly commercialised, especially with the lack of diversity in publishing.” BookToker zai_rambles, who focuses on books by and about Black people, said the shop was a good thing, but needs to be developed further. “Of course it’s making books a lot more accessible for people more casually on BookTok,” she said. “People don’t only save the videos, now they can see the video and buy [the book] immediately which I think is definitely going to encourage people to read more.” The shop, however, is “not varied enough”, she thinks. “It is quite limited and there are very popular books there, yes, but I’m finding that most of the books that I recommend or that I want to read are not on TikTok bookshop.” What makes BookTok “so beautiful”, she believes, “is the fact that you can find so many different kinds of genres and stories.” The TikTok bookshop “needs to mirror that as well”. As part of the launch of the books category of the TikTok shop, the social media platform has collaborated with some of its creators, including Laurens Little Library and AP Beswick, to “grow the BookTok community further”.",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/17/tiktok-to-sell-books-directly-to-users-via-marketplace
99,tiktok,Guardian,2022-11-16,Wakey Wines off-licence selling Prime and camel milk goes viral on TikTok,"Darren Grieves has travelled 130 miles (209km) from Carlisle with his three children to spend £66 on four drinks from an off-licence in Wakefield. The wagon driver has brought Darcy, 12, and nine-year-olds Lacy and Ryan to a fairly nondescript shop in the West Yorkshire city centre that has become an unlikely TikTok sensation. Wakefield Wines – or Wakey Wines, as it is more popularly known – is a viral hit, with people travelling from all over the UK to film videos, which each have hundreds of thousands of views, quoting popular catchphrases like “What’s the best shop in Wakey? Wakey Wines!”, “Abdul come closer, Abdul go back” and “Bingo bingo Gala bingo”. It began when the shop, which is otherwise a normal off-licence, became known for being one of the only places youngsters can get hold of Prime, a “hydration drink” made by the YouTubers Logan Paul and KSI. It has also been called the UK’s most expensive newsagent, selling bottles of the sought-after drink for £19.99, a whopping 10 times the price of the drink in Asda, where it is now sold out. On Thursday, the Grieves family bought two bottles of the blue raspberry flavour and one of the lemon lime, as well as a can of camel milk – also a hit on TikTok – for £66. “I’ve been sucked into it,” Grieves said, clutching his £6.50 camel milk outside the shop and looking slightly bewildered. “The kids got me into it and I’ve been watching the videos every day. It’s gone absolutely crazy. “I’ve never done anything like this before,” he added, laughing. “It’s not worth it.” Lacy disagreed though, saying her friends will be jealous that she got her hands on a drink that is sold out on the YouTubers’ website. “I’ll take the bottle to school. People put water in them,” she said. Though it is now perhaps as big as Binley Mega Chippy, a takeaway in Coventry that was also a TikTok triumph, the shop’s fame has passed many of its grownup customers by, despite some clues, such as cigarette lighters with the shop’s catchphrases being displayed on the counter. Melanie Pickering, who works at a solicitors firm in Wakefield, was buying snacks in the shop when she learned of Wakefield Wines’ success. “I had no idea but I think it’s very cool actually. I always like small local businesses doing well,” she said. Also visiting was teacher Jim Hutchinson and a class of six 15-year-olds who had stopped by after a trip from St Helens in Merseyside to the National Coal Mining Museum nearby, at the insistence of one of the students. The initial impression was underwhelming for Poppy Birkett, who exclaimed: “Is this all the hype? You’ve got to be joking.” But the teenagers took pictures outside the shop, with Bella Chaffers saying people at school would be impressed. “My friends have definitely heard of it. Everyone’s seen it on TikTok,” she said. Abdul Jabbar, who has worked in the shop for seven years and is often enlisted to film the videos of the owner Mohammed Az Nazir bantering with the customers, said parents had told him kids practise the catchphrases at home before their visit. “They get excited when they’re here, sometimes shouting, others playing music,” he said. While weekends often see queues of dozens of people outside the shop, some days are still fairly normal. While Jabbar maintains the markup on the drinks is small and that the price gouging happens at their supplier, KSI has criticised the shop for the “outrageous” prices. He told fans: “No, do not pay that much for Prime. I know people want Prime OK, just wait or camp out Asda nice and early, get in Asda nice and early and pay £2, OK, £2 for Prime.” But that does not seem to be stopping customers like Grieves, who thinks the prices are all part of the experience. So when is he going to drink the camel milk? “To be honest, I don’t really like milk. I’ll probably just give it to the dog.”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/16/wakey-wines-off-licence-prime-camel-milk-viral-tiktok-wakefield

Coverage of the event was broadcasted on numerous channels, with British free-to-air public broadcast television network ITV providing extensive coverage of the day’s events.
Starting from the early morning, the channel aired a special edition of Good Morning Britain, followed by a dedicated program that was anchored by presenters Tom Bradby and Julie Etchingham. 
The duo was joined by a host of guests, including reporters on The Mall, where thousands of people gathered to witness the newly crowned monarchs.
However, the day’s proceedings were briefly marred by a comment made by Bridgerton star Adjoa Andoh during the channel’s coverage. 
After the royal family appeared on the balcony, ITV cut to their temporary studio for reactions. 
When asked for her thoughts, Andoh remarked: “We have gone from the rich diversity of the Abbey to a terribly white balcony. I am very struck by that. I am also looking at those younger generations and thinking: ‘What are the nuances that they will inhabit when they grow?’”
The comment stunned the ITV presenters, and Myleene Klass was seen staring at the actor as she spoke.
The clip was later shared on Twitter, where it received a mixed response. Some people criticised Andoh for her words, while others applauded her for speaking out.
“They are a white family, for goodness sake! Does she think individual families should be subject to diversity quotas?” one person wrote on Twitter. 
A second added: “I’m so confused by Adjoa Andoh. What did she expect to see? The royal family is a white family!”
“Can’t believe a white family would be … white. The audacity!” Sky News host Rita Panahi sarcastically tweeted. 
Dr Shola Mos-Shogbamimu, a high-profile lawyer and political activist who herself frequents ITV panels, defended Andoh’s comments, claiming she “told no lies”. 
#AdjoaAndoh told no lies in factual observation of â€˜terribly Whiteâ€™ (literal & symbolic) Buckingham palace balcony at #Coronation in contrast to tokenism of race diversity at Westminster Abbey & got branded â€˜racistâ€™White people false equivalence of racism is laughableðŸ˜‚ https://t.co/awrFUksnsv
“Adjoa Andoh told no lies in [her] factual observation of [the] ‘terribly white’ (literal and symbolic) Buckingham Palace balcony at the coronation in contrast to tokenism of race diversity at Westminster Abbey and got branded ‘racist’. 
“White people false equivalence of racism is laughable.
“Even if Adjoa Andoh spent 99.99 per cent [of her time] on TV adulating King Charles and [the] British monarchy, that one observation of ‘White Balcony’ erases it because for racists she doesn’t know her place.”
Andoh responded to the backlash the following day during an appearance on BBC Radio 4’s Sunday morning show with Paddy O’Connell. 
“I think I upset a few people yesterday,” she said.
“I was talking about the day and how marvellous it was, and then looking at the balcony at the end and suddenly going: ‘Oh, it’s so white!’ because the day had been so mixed, and I didn’t mean to upset anybody.”",https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/royals/terribly-white-bridgerton-star-adjoa-andoh-speaks-out-after-white-royals-comment/news-story/b77313ba6a6e55ac042415f2a31e1841

Authorities told Korean news outlet Yonhap News that the singer, whose real name was Moon Bin, was found dead in his home by his manager in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, at around 8.10pm local time Wednesday.
“He appears to have taken his own life but an autopsy is being reviewed to determine the exact cause of death,” police said.
The official cause of death is pending, Page Six reports.
Moonbin’s record label, Fantagio, released a statement on Twitter on Wednesday confirming his death.
“First of all, I apologise for the sad and heartbreaking news,” the post, loosely translated, began.
“On April 19, Astro member Moonbin suddenly left us and became a star in the sky.”
The statement noted that Moonbin’s relatives and all of those who worked with him, including bandmates Cha Eun-woo, Rocky, Yoon San-ha, MJ and Jinjin, were “deeply mourning the deceased in great sadness and shock.”
The team asked fans to “refrain from speculative and malicious reports so that that the bereaved families, who are deeply saddened by the sudden sad news, can reverently commemorate and greet the deceased”.
Moonbin’s funeral will be held “as quietly as possible” with only family members, friends and colleagues attending, the statement also said.
Meanwhile, fans flooded the Candy Sugar Pop singer’s 3.8 million-follower Instagram account to honour him.
One heartbroken follower wrote: “You changed my life. You made me sooooo happy, Bin. Thank you for everything. I’ll love you forever. Rest in peace, my love.”
Another added, “He always had such a big smile on his face which could automatically make a people smile too but now that’s happiness is gone making everyone sad and loss of smile.”
A third said, “As an old K-Poper I hate K-Pop … I feel that those bad days we had in the past have been repeated again … R.I.P. #Moonbin.”
In December 2017, Kim Jonghyun, the former lead singer of top South Korean pop group SHINee, was found dead at his apartment in Seoul.
Then, less than two years later in November 2019, K-Pop star Goo Hara was found dead. She was 28.

2,twitter,news.com.au,2023-04-23,I’m A Celebrity 2023 eviction sparks outrage: ‘I’m so mad’,"Former Home And Away star and fan favourite Debra Lawrance was sent packing from I’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here on Sunday night in a decision that’s sparked plenty of outrage.
The Logie-winning actress quickly became a very popular member of this year’s cast, being seen by many as a caring mother figure and even sharing acting classes for the group, as well as taking part in tucker trials and terrifying challenges.
Lawrance was gracious as she left the camp, hugging the other celebrities before making her way over to the show’s hosts, Dr Chris Brown and Julia Morris.
But while the veteran performer took her eviction well, her loyal base of supporters were not so understanding, taking to Twitter to insist that the wrong decision had been made.
I'm so mad! #ImACelebrityAU
Debs added so much to this show! We need to vote out people that donâ€™t bring anything to the table *cough Dom* #ImACelebrityAU
Iâ€™m going miss Debâ€™s presence in the group. You voted wrong, Australia. #ImACelebrityAU
Who the hell is voting for Dom?! Justice for Deb!  #ImACelebrityAU
I just want to talk to who is voting? I WANNA TALK. #ImACelebrityAU
Nooooo not Deb ðŸ˜¢ #ImACelebrityAU
#ImACelebrityAU NOOOOOO ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
Australia why did your do this?! #ImACelebrityAU
It comes after the popular campmate admitted to news.com.au the day before entering the jungle that she’d been nervous that appearing on the show might ruin her career.
While Lawrance was a longtime fan of the reality show – “It’s just really good entertainment” – she wasn’t sure what to do when the offer to be a contestant came through earlier this year.
“I didn’t have a work excuse. I’d just finished a play and a TV series and done a movie, and then there was this gap because I’m doing a play with Melbourne Theatre Company in August and I thought, ‘Oh, I’ll have a rest,’” she said.
When the offer was made, “[I] rang well-placed friends in high places saying, ‘Is this going to destroy my career, my credibility?’”
Thos friends allayed her fears and convinced Lawrance to stick to the philosophy she said has served her well so far in a career that’s traversed everything from stage to soaps to films: Say yes to just about everything.
“I’ve been on the planet too long not to do everything that’s offered,” she said.
Fortunately, her fears were clearly unfounded, with Lawrance earning herself plenty of new fans through her stint on the show.

3,twitter,news.com.au,2023-04-22,Barry Humphries dead at 89 after re-entering hospital,"Legendary Australian comedian Barry Humphries has died at the age of 89.
His family has said he “never lost his brilliant mind” even at the end. While Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has remembered him as the “brightest star in the galaxy” and King Charles said he was “saddened” by the tragic news. 
Humphries – famed for iconic comedy characters like Dame Edna Everage and Sir Les Patterson – died on Saturday following recent health issues caused by a broken hip.
Just weeks ago, Humphries had spoken of the “ridiculous reason” behind the health ailment that would ultimately claim his life. 
His wife Lizzie was at his side as were his daughters Emily and Tessa while his UK based sons Rupert and Oscar flew in to join them. His 10 grandchildren were also present when he passed.
In a statement the Humphries family said he died peacefully at Sydney’s St Vincent Hospital in Darlinghurst, east of the CBD. 
“He was completely himself until the very end, never losing his brilliant mind, his unique wit and generosity of spirit,” the statement said.
“With over seventy years on the stage, he was an entertainer to his core, touring up until the last year of his life and planning more shows that will sadly never be.
“His audiences were precious to him, and he never took them for granted.
“Although he may be best remembered for his work in theatre, he was a painter, author, poet, and a collector and lover of Art in all its forms. He was also a loving and devoted husband, father, grandfather, and a friend and confidant to many.
“His passing leaves a void in so many lives.
“The characters he created, which brought laughter to millions, will live on.”
The Victorian government is in talks with the family of Barry Humphries about how best to pay tribute which could include the possibility of a state funeral.
“We’re in conversation with his family in relation to the best way to honour his legacy and his contribution to Victoria, so there’ll be more information to come,” Victoria’s minister for tourism, sports and major events, Steve Dimopoulos, said on Sunday.
He added a range of options are being discussed.
“The primary mover of these things is the family because it’s their gift effectively to decide in conversation with government,” he said.
“So, yes, it could be that [a state funeral]. It could be many other things to honour his legacy.
‘Ridiculous’ health battle
Humphries had been readmitted to hospital just days after being discharged after his health “worsened”.
Entertainment reporter Peter Ford broke news of Humphries’ readmission to hospital on Seven’s Sunrise, sharing that the comic had been determined to be back on stage by the end of the year
“Barry won’t give up easily. Whether that’s a realistic goal, I don’t know … I am told that Barry’s health has worsened in the last week,” said Ford.
But his health complications due to ongoing issues from hip replacement surgery, an ordeal he’d been suffering from for several months, proved too much. 
Humphries revealed in an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald last month that he’d been in “agony” since breaking his hip.
“It was the most ridiculous thing, like all domestic incidents are. I was reaching for a book, my foot got caught on a rug or something, and down I went,” he explained, revealing he was undergoing “very painful” rehabilitation sessions.
Tribute flow for Humphries
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese took to Twitter soon after the news of Humphries’ passing with a photo of Dame Edna Everage. 
“For 89 years, Barry Humphries entertained us through a galaxy of personas, from Dame Edna to Sandy Stone,” he wrote. 
“But the brightest star in that galaxy was always Barry.
“A great wit, satirist, writer and an absolute one-of-kind, he was both gifted and a gift. May he rest in peace.”
Global comedy superstar Ricky Gervais shared his parting thoughts on Humphries. 
“Farewell, Barry Humphries, you Comedy genius.”

Farewell, Barry Humphries, you Comedy genius.
Comedian Matt Lucas of Little Britain fame also paid tribute. 
“I wonder if all geniuses are as lovely as Barry Humphries,” he said. 
“Thank you for delighting and inspiring us. Quite simply, you were the greatest.”
Peter Ford shared his tribute to the Australian entertainment icon.
“Even though the last paragraph has been inevitable for many days, it’s still incredibly sad,” he said. 
“What a brilliant mind and what a legacy. Australia will send many other more funny people into the world – but I can’t imagine any will match Barry Humphries.”
British comedian Mark Gattis, creator of The League of Gentleman series, said the world was “blessed” to have Barry Humphries. 
“Staggeringly inventive and permanently fascinated. An artist, a genius and a very, very, very, VERY funny man. Goodnight, possum.”
An Australian comedy legend
Born in 1934, Humphries started his comedy career in 1953 when he was still in his teens, joining the newly-formed Melbourne Theatre Company and debuting a character that would soon become a legend in her own right: Purple-haired Melbourne housewife, Edna Everage.
A prolific actor and writer across stage, film and television, Humphries’ international career skyrocketed when he relocated to London in the 1960s. 
Humphries’ film career began with the 1967 Peter Cook movie Bedazzled and continued through 1972’s The Adventures of Barry McKenzie, 1981’s Shock Treatment, 1997’s Spice World and 2003’s Finding Nemo. 
But Humphries’ was arguably best known hilarious stage and television appearances as characters like Everage and Patterson. Dame Edna was chat show gold: Take this classic 2004 appearance on Michael Parkinson’s chat show, where Dame Edna has the host and fellow guests Dame Judi Dench and Sharon Osbourne eating out of the palm of her hand – all while constantly insulting all three. 
While Humphries was recently beset by health problems since his hip-breaking fall, the legendary entertainer was still able to make headlines with his famous wit in recent years: A 2021 live appearance on British television sparked laughs – and controversy – when Humphries appeared to confuse the fill-in host with the show’s regular host, who had recently come out as gay. Some viewers didn’t realise Humphries was in on the joke, as he never broke his poker face while congratulating the wrong host for his bravery in coming out. 
Humphries, who wed four times, is survived by his wife of 24 years, Elizabeth Spender, and four children. ",https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/celebrity-deaths/barry-humphries-dead-at-89-after-reentering-hospital-for-hip-problems/news-story/6de896055ac6a2865a38e8ab4a34b04b
4,twitter,news.com.au,2023-04-24,I’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here: Domenica Calarco evicted in stunning twist,"Many expected her to be the next Queen of the Jungle – but instead, Domenica Calarco has been booted out of the jungle.
The former Married At First Sight star was given her marching orders on Monday night’s episode of I’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here! in a decision that left her campmates – and plenty of viewers at home – gobsmacked.
Twitter lit up as fans reacted to the stunning decision:
Noooo Dom. Didn't think I'd like her, but I do. Thought she'd go all the way #ImACelebrityAU
What just happened. Shook #ImACelebrityAU
Omg I didnâ€™t see that coming!  #ImACelebrityAU
Nooooo! Dom #ImACelebrityAU
I genuinely thought Adam would leave before dom #ImACelebrityAU
Wow! I thought Dom would have gone further!  #ImACelebrityAU
I am genuinely shocked Dom has been eliminated. I honestly thought they were setting her up for the final. #ImACelebrityAU
TOTAL SHOCK! Really thought she would be in the TOP 3! ðŸ’•ðŸŒ´#ImACelebrityAU
broooo i properly thought dom was gonna win this!? #ImACelebrityAU
While clearly disappointed by the verdict, Calarco told her campmates that she’d “had a feeling” she was going home.
“I had a feeling today. I actually had a feeling,” she insisted as she said her goodbyes.
“I just want to say, I had the best time ever, guys. Smash it! Enjoy the last six days and I’ll see you all at the end of this.”
During her exit interview with Dr Chris Brown and Julia Morris, Calarco explained that her intuition had kicked in ahead of the elimination.
“Weirdly, today I had a feeling my time was over. I think yesterday conquering a huge fear of mine I felt, ‘OK my time here is done, I’ll be happy to leave whenever I do,’” she said.
“Of course I would have loved to have won and have that money for my charity.”
She added: “I am a completely different woman. I am leaving the jungle just a better person. Maybe a few kilos lighter. I have learnt so many lessons. I have met incredible people that I will call my friends for life. 
“I just think, I know in myself now I am so much stronger than what I thought I was. That is a huge lesson. For that I will be eternally grateful.”
Calarco provided plenty of memorable moments during her time in the jungle, but none even come close to her explosive confrontation with Kerri-Anne Kennerley, which saw the TV veteran quit the show after just three days.
During a food trial early in the season, Calarco slammed Kennerley for refusing to take part or even attempt to take a bite.
Exploding in rage, the reality star brought up the make-up clause in Kennerley’s contract – which meant she’d been allowed to break the rules and bring cosmetics into camp.
“Miss big contract lady, ‘Can’t tell me what to do.’ I don’t want your [make-up], I don’t want your Revlon 1989 lipstick, doll. It’s not fair – it’s not fair to everyone in there who actually tries,” Calarco said.
“Why are you here, bro? Legit, actually, why are you here?” she continued, as Kennerley sat stunned.
“I probably don’t have to answer anything to you,” she said back.
“Of course you don’t! Because your little contract states it,” Calarco shot back.
“Literally no respect or decency for anyone else but yourself. I’ve never met anyone so selfish in all my life.”

5,twitter,news.com.au,2023-05-03,Jock Zonfrillo was found by police at Lygon Street’s Zagame’s House,"Celebrity chef Jock Zonfrillo was found dead inside a Melbourne hotel just metres away from the home his family had recently moved out of to make a fresh start overseas.
Zonfrillo, 46, was found dead by police about 2am on Monday following a welfare check at boutique hotel Zagame’s House in inner-city Carlton.
The swanky hotel, which offers rooms for $650 a night, eerily backs onto the rental home Zonfrillo had lived in with his family since 2020.
Local business owners say they witnessed police vehicles arriving at the hotel in the early hours of Monday.
Zagame’s House management denied the MasterChef judge died at their hotel when contacted by news.com.au, despite numerous reports confirming police were called to the building.
Zonfrillo, his wife and their two young kids had reportedly packed up their bags and moved to the Italian city of Rome just three weeks before his death. 
Their home was placed back on the rental market for $3000 a week in April.
A neighbour of Zonfrillo in the Carlton terrace where he and his family had lived told Seven News on Tuesday that Zonfrillo “left three weeks ago”.
Carlton resident Stuart Ayer said: “He left about three weeks ago. Obviously he’s come back and who knows what happened.”
Zonfrillo’s family announced the MasterChef judge’s death in a statement on Monday afternoon.
“With completely shattered hearts and without knowing how we can possibly move through life without him, we are devastated to share that Jock passed away yesterday,” his family said in a statement.
“So many words can describe him, so many stories can be told, but at this time we’re too overwhelmed to put them into words.
“For those who crossed his path, became his mate, or were lucky enough to be his family, keep this proud Scot in your hearts when you have your next whisky.
“We implore you to please let us grieve privately as we find a way to navigate through this and find space on the other side to celebrate our irreplaceable husband, father, brother, son and friend.”
Tributes have poured in from all over the world for the late chef.
“I’m in total shock to wake up to the sudden death of chef Jock Zonfrillo. We had the best time working together for this years master chef, I can’t tell how good it was to work with him!” Jamie Oliver said on Instagram.
“Jock was very generous to me with his time and spirit in the show and for that I was really grateful … Mellisa, Andy & Jock work as the most inspiring judges and mentors and each have there very own unique view and style…Jock will be so very missed…I can’t believe I’m writing this...”
“Saddened by the devastating news of Jock Zonfrillo‘s passing. I truly enjoyed the time we spent together on MasterChef in Australia,” Gordon Ramsay said on Twitter.
“My deepest condolences and sincere thoughts. I am utterly devastated. We spoke recently,” celebrity chef Joey Vargetto said.
Contestants on the show who spent considerable time with Mr Zonfrillo also expressed their sadness at the loss.
“I’m so shocked… rest in peace chef, my heart and condolences to loved ones,” MasterChef contestant Reynold Poernomo said on Instagram.
“So sad to hear this. Rest in peace Jock. You will be missed,” fellow contestant Brendan Pang said.
The popular TV personality had flown back to Australia for the launch of the 15th season of the competition cooking show, where he was a judge.
Zonfrillo was scheduled to take part in a number of media interviews both ahead of and following the first episode, which was due to air on Monday night.
One of these interviews involved the father-of-four appearing as a guest on Channel 10’s The Project in the evening of his death.
He had battled with a crippling addiction to heroin which had taken hold of his life by the time he was 15.
“I’m not proud of it at all,” he said about his drug use. “It’s embarrassing and it’s embarrassing for my parents. But I’m thankful to have been able to come through the other side of that and I’m thankful for all the people who helped me at the right moments.”
After getting clean, he followed a successful career path and joined the Channel 10 program in 2019 for the 2020 season alongside Melissa Leong and Andy Allen.

Network 10 and his family made the announcement in a statement, declaring that the show would be postponed for a week due to his sudden death. 
“With completely shattered hearts and without knowing how we can possibly move through life without him, we are devastated to share that Jock passed away yesterday,” his family said in a statement on Monday.
“So many words can describe him, so many stories can be told, but at this time we’re too overwhelmed to put them into words.

Mr Zonfrillo is survived by his wife Lauren Fried and his four children Ava, Sophie, Alfie and Isla.
Police are not treating the death as suspicious. 
“Police attended a Lygon Street address for a welfare check and located a man deceased about 2am on May 1,” a Victoria Police spokesperson said. 
Saddened by the devastating news of Jock Zonfrillo's passing. I truly enjoyed the time we spent together on MasterChef in Australia. Sending all my love to Lauren and the family in this difficult time Gx
“The 46-year-old man‘s death is not being treated as suspicious.”
Mr Zonfrillo had only posted on his own Instagram about the next season of MasterChef that was due to start on Monday, just hours before police would find him dead. 
Network 10 also shared a statement.
“Network 10 and Endemol Shine Australia are deeply shocked and saddened at the sudden loss of Jock Zonfrillo, a beloved member of the MasterChef Australia family. Jock passed away in Melbourne yesterday,” the network said.
“Jock was known to Australians as a chef, best-selling author, philanthropist and MasterChef judge but he will be best remembered as a loving father, husband, brother and son.”
Mr Zonfrillo outlined his struggles with heroin addiction in his book ‘Last Shot’ which details his life story. 
“Jock’s life spiralled out of control when he tried heroin for the first time as a teenager while growing up in 1980s Glasgow,” the book’s blurb reads.

“For years he balanced a career as a rising star amongst legendary chefs with a crippling drug addiction that took him down many dark paths.
“On New Year’s Eve 1999, Jock shot up his last shot of heroin before boarding a plane to Sydney, where he would find passion and new meaning in life in the most unexpected places. 
“There would be more struggles ahead, including two failed marriages, the closure of his prized restaurant during COVID-19, his time on-country, and some very public battles.”
The book was praised for its candour and Mr Zonfrillo was praised for his resilience by the world’s top chefs. 
“I’ve known Jock for 25 years. He is not only a great mate but an incredibly talented chef - in Australia and around the world,” Matt Moran wrote about the book. 
“Last Shot really shows how resilient Jock is and how far he has come in his personal and professional life. I’m inspired by how brave Jock has been for putting this biography out there.”
The renowned chef established himself in Australia as the head chef at Restaurant 41 in Sydney in 2000, before going on to open Restaurant Orana in 2013. 
Restaurant Orana was named as Restaurant of the Year by Gourmet Traveller in 2018 and by the Good Food Guide in 2019.
He initially worked under renowned Michelin-starred chef Marco Pierre White. 
“Zonfrillo climbed his way to the top of the gastronomic ladder only to abdicate his position. He still inspires chefs worldwide,” Mr Pierre White said about Mr Zonfrillo in 2022. 
Mr Zonfrillo grew up in Glasgow to an Italian father and Scottish mother. 
He began working in kitchens as a dishwasher part-time at the age of 13 before going on to leave school to start an apprenticeship in the kitchens of the Turnberry Hotel on the west coast of Scotland. 
Jimmy Barnes was one of the first to pay tribute to his “dear friend”, saying it was a “very sad day” on social media. 
“Jock was like a brother to me and we made each other laugh and cry. My heart goes out to his family. I am speechless,” he said. 
Celebrity chefs Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay also paid tribute to Mr Zonfrillo.

7,twitter,news.com.au,2023-05-06,Penny Mordaunt labelled ‘Pippa Middleton of the coronation’,"King Charles and Queen Camilla were the central focus of Saturday’s coronation, but viewers frequently found their eyes straying elsewhere: towards a potential future prime minister of the United Kingdom.
Conservative politician Penny Mordaunt featured prominently during the ceremony in her role as Lord President of the Privy Council, which required her to carry the Sword of State, and to hand Charles the Jewelled Sword of Offering. She was the first woman in history to do so.
The Sword of State, which dates back to the 1600s and is also used during the state opening of Britain’s parliament, is 121 centimetres long and weighs 3.5 kilograms. Ms Mordaunt, 50, had to hold it aloft at a right angle from her body for long stretches of the two-hour event.

RELATED: ‘Truly unthinkable’ royal photo emerges
Her feat of upper body strength earned admiration from viewers, some of her political opponents among them. So did her stylish appearance, which contrasted strikingly with the parade of older, largely robed men around her.
Ms Mordaunt wore a bespoke teal dress and cape from London-based label Safiyaa, and a matching hat designed by Jane Taylor.
The outfit was embroidered with gold ferns, a “feminised” reference to the traditional Privy Council uniform, and its colour was described as “Poseidon”, a nod to her constituency in the seaside city Portsmouth.
“Got to say it, Penny Mordaunt looks damn fine! The sword bearer steals the show,” said Emily Thornberry, a Labour MP, prompting her amused followers to ask whether her Twitter account had been “hacked”.
“The Penny is mightier than the sword,” said another Labour MP, Chris Bryant.
Ms Mordaunt also impressed the American singer Courtney Love, who said she was “obsessed” with the Tory politician.
“I’m now obsessed with Penny Mordaunt,” said Ms Love.
“Obsessed! I couldn’t take my eyes off her.”
Author Caitlin Moran joked that Ms Mordaunt and her sword were “the ‘Pippa Middleton’s Bum’ of the coronation”, reminding viewers of Princess Catherine’s wedding and her sister’s attention-grabbing dress.
The British press echoed that thought, with The Telegraph and The Guardian both labelling Ms Mordaunt “the Pippa Middleton of the coronation”, while The Daily Mail’s royal editor anointed her “the ‘Pippa’s bum’” of the event.

British Twitter today pic.twitter.com/L6ieiNKOkI
Ms Mordaunt is currently Leader of the House of Commons in parliament, and previously served as Britain’s defence minister. She twice ran for the Conservative Party’s leadership in 2022, losing to Liz Truss and then to the current Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak. However her showing was strong enough in both instances to make her a future contender.
Her role in the coronation required less politicking, though according to Ms Mordaunt, there was some training involved.
“It’s drawing on all of my military drill experience,” she joked to Politico before the event, alluding to her time as a reservist in the Royal Navy.
“I will be carrying the Sword of State, which is the heaviest sword, so I’ve been doing some press-ups to train for that,” she quipped to The Times’ Red Box podcast.
“It has to be carried at right angles to the body – hence the need to do press-ups – pointing upwards, out in front of you, for some time. We practised with some replicas that were weighted. And it’s a huge honour to do it.”
Ms Mordaunt further joked that her experience as a reservist had trained her in the art of “standing for long periods of time” without fainting.
In a social media post after the ceremony, she struck a humble note.
“Honoured to be part of the coronation with thousands of others who played their part,” Ms Mordaunt wrote.
“I’m very aware that our armed forces, police officers and others have been marching or standing for hours as part of the ceremony to keep us all safe. In comparison, my job was rather easier.
“Huge and heartfelt thanks to all who made this so remarkable. I’m so proud of you all and the King and Queen today.”
That sparked one final moment of appreciation for her fashion sense, courtesy of the broadcaster Rylan Clark, who is set to host the BBC’s Eurovision coverage in a few days and replied: “Can I have your cape for Eurovision please?”",https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/royals/pippa-of-the-coronation-world-swoons-over-penny-mordaunt/news-story/618131fdd44707382c9d23eafcb0db07
8,twitter,news.com.au,2023-04-27,Japan‘s Kirin Holdings scores Blackmores vitamins in $1.85b takeover,"Much-loved Aussie vitamin brand Blackmores is set to be taken over by a major Japanese firm as part of a takeover deal worth a staggering $1.88 billion. 
On Thursday, Kirin Holdings – the parent company behind Lion, which owns Aussie beer brands including XXXX, Hahn and Tooheys – revealed it planned to take over 100 per cent of the country’s biggest vitamin business. 
Under the plan, Kirin would pay shareholders a whopping $95 cash per share in order completely takeover the firm, with Blackmore shares jumping more than 20 per cent on the news.
If the deal goes through, Blackmores will be removed from the Australian Securities Exchange as soon as August.
Blackmores’ shareholders will vote on the proposed deal in a July meeting.
However, it is expected to pass easily as the Blackmores board already unanimously advised shareholders to support the deal.
Major shareholder and former chairman Marcus Blackmore – whose father Maurice Blackmore founded the company in 1932 – is also on board, declaring Kirin would be a strong “brand custodian” for Blackmores.
“I believe this presents the next evolution of the business my father founded 90 years ago,” the 78-year-old said.
He also told Reuters he had wanted a way out for 18 months after developing an “antagonistic” relationship with its board.
“When you’ve spent 57 years at a business, you don’t want to see the business suffer, and you want to see the business successful. I have no doubt in my mind that Kirin will deliver on that promise to me,” he said.
According to the Australian Financial Review, Mr Blackmore’s 18 per cent stake in the company is worth $334 million. 
Kirin president and CEO Yoshinori Isozaki also welcomed the proposed sale in a statement.
“Blackmores presents an exciting opportunity to transform the scale and reach of our Health Science domain,” he said. 
“Kirin Group is working to create social value and economic value by solving social issues through our business activities, and we have been transforming our business from a brewing business to a business model creating value across Food & Beverages and Pharmaceuticals domains, based on the concept of Creating Shared Value.”
The looming sale comes hot on the heels of a major recent controversy which saw social media users push for a company boycott after Mr Blackmore declared his opposition to the proposed Voice to Parliament and pledged his support for Northern Territory senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price’s ‘vote no’ campaign.
“If Jacinta tells me I should vote no, I am voting no. She obviously knows a lot more about the Aboriginal issues than I do,” he told the Financial Review in February.
His comments saw the hashtag #Boycottblackmores shoot to the top end of Australia’s Twitter trending list with outrage at Blackmore’s stance flowing in thick and fast.
At the time, a Blackmores Group spokesperson said it was not able to comment on the views of Mr Blackmore who has not been an employee or director of the company since late 2020.
“His views are completely independent of Blackmores Group,” they said.
“Blackmores is committed to supporting the health and wellbeing of all people and values and celebrates diversity, inclusivity and equality for employees, customers, partners, and those in the community.”",https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/australias-blackmores-vitamins-snapped-up-by-japanese-beer-juggernaut-in-185b-takeover/news-story/6a22aba56f2b182e5cb260ae63328743
9,twitter,news.com.au,2023-05-05,David Jones blasted after customer fails to find staff member for 20 minutes,"If you’re paying more than $1000 for some fancy new clothes you might expect store staff to fawn over you – or at the very least help ensure you get the right size. 
But a customer service fail at an Australian retail icon this week has highlighted how some of the biggest brands are frustrating shoppers. 
“It was not what I expected,” said Queenslander Gary Mortimer of his shopping trip to David Jones in Brisbane. 
Professor Mortimer, who is a marketing expert at Queensland University of Technology, documented his less than ideal shopping experience on Twitter. 
“Respectfully, I’ve been wandering around David Jones Brisbane CBD for 10 minutes with a $1000 MJ Bale suit – just looking for a team member.”
In his uploaded video he wandered around the floor only to find the MJ Bale concession as well as concession after concession, and register after register, devoid of staff.
David Jones told news.com.au that “clearly in this instance we have not achieved customer expectations,” and said it had apologised to the customer. 
MJ Bale said it was “appalled to say the least,” at the customer service fail. 
The retail expert told news.com.au that he was at the Queens Plaza store about 2pm on Wednesday. Stopping by the stand of high end Australian brand MJ Bale he said there was no staff member there to help him pick the right suit. 
After 10 minutes at the concession, and after finding a suit, he then walked around the shop floor for another 10 minutes to try and locate someone – anyone – to help with sizing and direct him to the change room. 
‘Not what I expected at David Jones’ flagship’
“Maybe 15-20 minutes isn’t too bad – but what was surprising was the lack of staff in many of the concessions in the menswear department,” Prof Mortimer said. 
“It’s definitely a ‘price versus expectation’ situation. If you’re buying a higher-quality product, you expect higher levels of quality service.
“This is not what I would have expected to experience at a David Jones CBD flagship store.” 
Prof Mortimer said the challenge for department stores was more of the floor space was being given over to concessions, not run by the store itself, meaning the customer experience could be wildly different depending on what brand you were purchasing. 
“It’s those brands that are responsible for staffing, inventory and service.”
But Prof Mortimer said it was more than that. Service in department stores could also vary depending on what branch of the same chain you were in. 
“I had quite the opposite experience at David Jones’ Sydney Elizabeth Street store earlier in the week,” he said.
The Sydney CBD store is David Jones’ undoubted Australian flagship.
A recent refit cost a whopping $400 million with the 12 storey retail behemoth featuring an entire floor dedicated to shoes, a top end food hall, multiple eateries and exclusive brands like Loewe and Balenciaga. 
“There was plenty of staff there and great service too,” he said. 
The brand is the same but the challenge for David Jones – and other stores – is that there is often a very different shopping experience between their flagship branches and smaller, suburban outlets. 
“We have been investing in service training nationally and have seen improvements in customer satisfaction levels,” a David Jones spokesman told news.com.au. 
“We have met with Mr Mortimer and taken his feedback and apologised directly. David Jones remains committed to improving its instore and online experiences.”
A MJ Bale spokeswoman said the lack of staff wasn’t up to scratch. 
“MJ Bale prides itself on our exceptional customer service, and we’re appalled, to say the least.
“We will endeavour to make sure this never happens again.”
Certainly Australian department stores have gone through torrid times with the rise of online and increasingly price conscious shoppers. 
David Jones has been owned by the South African firm Woolworths Holdings – no connection to the supermarket of the same name – which bought the chain in 2014 for more than $2 billion.
But in December 2022, it agreed to sell DJs for what is thought to be just $100 million to private equity firm Anchorage Capital. The sale price was only a quarter of the cost of the Sydney CBD store refurbishment. 
However, the overall value of David Jones has been diminished by hundreds of millions of dollars after Woolworths Holdings either sold off – and rented back – many DJs stores or didn’t include them in the sale to Anchorage.
Over the past two years David Jones has closed suburban stores in Brisbane’s Toowong and Upper Mt Gravatt, while Myer recently announced it would exit its flagship store just up the Queen Street Mall from David Jones.
Yet both David Jones and Myer have done better of late. In March, DJs said sales were up 13.6 per cent in the first two months of 2023 while concessions, like MJ Bale, soared by 32 per cent. It said CBD stores were busy with customers as people shrugged off the last of the pandemic. 
Meanwhile, in January, Myer said it recorded its best result in nearly 20 years under CEO John King with profits for the half year up 104 per cent and sales rising by 37.9 per cent.

10,twitter,news.com.au,2023-05-12,Elon Musk confirms new Twitter CEO as NBCUniversal exec Linda Yaccarino,"Elon Musk has confirmed the identity of the new chief executive of Twitter. 
He revealed her name a day after he said he would be handing over the reins. 
The social media site owner has poached Linda Yaccarino the former advertising chief of media giant NBCUniversal as the next CEO of Twitter, concluding a months-long search for a successor to lead the embattled social media platform.
“I am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter!” Mr Musk tweeted. . 
“(She) will focus primarily on business operations, while I focus on product design and new technology.
“Looking forward to working with Linda to transform this platform into X, the everything app.”
Mr Musk is shifting to a role as Twitter’s executive chairman and chief technology officer, reports the New York Post.
A day earlier, Mr Musk tweeted that Twitter’s next CEO would take over in about six weeks.
Mr Musk’s tweet came hours after NBCUniversal, itself part of the media, theme parks and communications group Comcast, announced Ms Yaccarino was leaving her post “effectively immediately.”
I am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter!@LindaYacc will focus primarily on business operations, while I focus on product design & new technology.Looking forward to working with Linda to transform this platform into X, the everything app. https://t.co/TiSJtTWuky
“It has been an absolute honour to be part of Comcast NBCUniversal and lead the most incredible team,” Ms Yaccarino said in an earlier statement.
“We’ve transformed our company and the entire industry — and I am so proud of what we’ve accomplished together, and grateful to my colleagues and mentors, especially Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh and the entire NBCU leadership team.”
The announcement marks the latest step in Mr Musk’s ongoing overhaul of Twitter. The billionaire has said for months that he would step down as CEO as soon as he found a suitable replacement.
“I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!” Mr Musk tweeted last December.
As CEO, Ms Yaccarino will be tasked with spearheading the company’s business as it places increased emphasis on its Twitter Blue subscription service and other new features.
She also will seek to boost relations with corporate advertisers, who fled in droves last year over Mr Musk’s chaotic changes to account verification and content moderation.
Recent court filings revealed that Mr Musk had merged Twitter into a new firm called X Corp. Mr Musk has described his $66 billion acquisition of Twitter as an “accelerant” for this plans to build a super-app he calls “X.”
Mr Musk has suggested the app could be similar to Tencent-owned WeChat, which allows users access to an array of services ranging from payments to food delivery and beyond.

11,twitter,news.com.au,2023-05-11,"Elon Musk to step down as Twitter CEO, reveals replacement, new role","Elon Musk has announced he is stepping down from the top job at a Twitter.
The controversial billionaire, who sensationally bought the social media platform in October 2022 for $US44 billion, revealed he had already selected an unnamed female replacement for the CEO role, who will take over in around six weeks.
Musk’s role will “transition to being exec chair and chief technology officer (CTO), overseeing product, software & sysops”.
Excited to announce that Iâ€™ve hired a new CEO for X/Twitter. She will be starting in ~6 weeks!My role will transition to being exec chair & CTO, overseeing product, software & sysops.
He had always planned to remain in the CEO role temporarily, previously revealing he only intended to overhaul the company before handing over the reins.
He had also spoken out about having “too much work” and sleeping at the social media juggernaut’s San Francisco headquarters while rolling out massive changes.
His exit from the top job comes after an embarrassing incident in December, when he asked Twitter if he should vacate the position – and 57.5 per cent of more than 17 million Twitter accounts said yes.

Linda Yaccarino likely to replace Elon Musk as new Twitter CEO
“I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!” Musk tweeted at the time.
His announcement has been welcomed by critics, who have accused him of damaging the Twitter brand.
“WHAT TOOK U SO LONG??? RUINED THIS APP,” one person posted, with another adding: “ … have you considered transitioning to another company instead? Seems like there is most likely (definitely probably) a better fit out there. Better for us, at least.”
The backlash comes after months of turmoil, which included the firing of the majority of Twitter employees – with many others quitting of their own accord.
Other controversial moves included reinstating a slew of far-right personalities who had been suspended from Twitter, suspending reporters and introducing charges.
Last month, for example, countless celebrities began to see their coveted Twitter blue ticks disappear after refusing to pay for verification.
For years, certain Twitter accounts – such as those belonging to stars, public figures and companies – came with a famous blue tick, which indicated that the accounts were genuine and had been verified in order to prevent impersonation.
However, soon after taking over the social media giant, the eccentric billionaire announced plans to make verification subscription-only, even for legacy accounts that had long been verified.
Under the controversial new rules, blue ticks have now been removed from accounts which do not pay for it, with less than 1 per cent of Twitter users signing up for the paid service. 
Verification doesn’t come cheap, with an $US8 ($11.80) per month price tag for a blue tick for individuals, and $US1000 ($1484) per month for a gold one for organisations.
Grey ticks will be in place for government-affiliated accounts or multilateral organisations.
The change has sparked fears that fraudsters and troublemakers will now be able to impersonate famous people or companies with greater ease, now the verification is removed from so many accounts.
Musk’s running of Twitter has also been slammed for taking his attention away from his other high-profile jobs running Tesla and SpaceX, and has also made headlines for the social media platform’s drop in revenue – which mostly comes from advertising and which is tipped to be less than $US3 billion this year, compared with $US4 billion in 2022.
He recently announced Twitter was “trending to break even” after previously claiming it was facing bankruptcy.
In recent weeks, Musk moved Twitter under the umbrella of his “X” shell corporation, meaning that while Twitter was still used on the platform, the company name was officially defunct. 
He has also spoken out about using Twitter to build an all-purpose “X” application that combines messages, payments and more.
He this week announced encrypted direct messages at Twitter, and that audio and video calls are going to be added to the platform.
Meanwhile, speculation is turning to who might step into the CEO position.
Among those rumoured to be in the running are Ella Irwin, who works on trust and safety at Twitter, SpaceX’s President and COO Gwynne Shotwell, Tesla’s board of directors chair Robyn Denholm and Linda Yaccarino, who runs ads and partnerships for NBCUniversal.

12,twitter,news.com.au,2023-04-25,"Anzac Day: Twitter user says values ‘no longer reflected’, slams ‘illegal’ wars, US-China confrontation","A Twitter user has sparked debate online with a controversial claim about Australia’s relationship to Anzac Day.
Australians and New Zealanders gathered to commemorate the 108th anniversary of the landing of Anzac troops at Gallipoli in World War I on Tuesday. Services were held in cities and towns, big and small, to mark Anzac Day — the most solemn day on the Australian calendar.
But writing on Monday night, Brad Turner — who describes himself as a former Navy submariner and AFP officer — took to the social media platform to argue that the values of the annual celebration were “no longer reflected” in Australia’s actions.
He took particular aim at Australia’s confrontation with China on behalf of the United States.
Australia is a society that dutifully gets up early every April 25 to gather, Mach & remember our Dead.  Speeches are made, politicians speak of sacrifice & honour whilst possessing or embodying neither. That same society that holds paramount ideals of egalitarianism, mateship &â€¦ pic.twitter.com/sbHHbRiYAF
“Australia is a society that dutifully gets up early every April 25 to gather, march and remember our dead,” he wrote in the post, which has been viewed more than 20,000 times.
“Speeches are made, politicians speak of sacrifice and honour whilst possessing or embodying neither. That same society that holds paramount ideals of egalitarianism, mateship and sacrifice is forgotten on the other 364 days of the year. 
“On those days Australia marches right past veteran suicides, war crimes, illegal wars and widespread inequality and corruption. Is it really a day of remembrance? Or is it theatrics so society can pretend they care about victims of war or our conduct as a country with an aim to feel better about apathy and inaction as a nation towards these things.
“We don’t notice any of these things because we are too busy marching. But this time it’s headlong into another pointless American war with China. The things we celebrate about our nation on Anzac Day are sadly no longer reflected in Australia’s actions. They have not been in some time.”
A number of people agreed with Mr Turner.
“I don’t like Anzac Day. It overlooks our follies in joining Britain and US wars. WWII was noble. The rest were con jobs to enrich the industrialists. Our people have all these solemn events only to assuage their ‘je ne c’est quoi’ because they don’t feel any guilt but should,” one wrote.
“Our politicians spend more on memorial monuments and museums that they can put their name on a plaque on the wall than they do for the actual veterans who are suffering from PTSD or other ‘souvenirs’ they have brought back from their tours,” another agreed.
“Flag waving patriotism has taken over Anzac Day. We are one step away from parades of military hardware while the populace salute. What should be a reflection on the horrors of war has become it‘s celebration. John Howard did this,” a third said.
“Listening to the Labor government yesterday follow in the footsteps of the Coalition, justifying spending billions antagonising China at America’s request is not the ‘lest we forget’ I think about,” a fourth wrote.
But others hit back and said Anzac Day was still important.
“Mate … it’s about remembering the sacrifice and loss of our mates … lest we forget,” one wrote, adding, “I don’t worry about [politicians] anymore grandstanding on the day. It’s our day not theirs to remember our mates.”
Another said, “It is tradition. It separates the fluff of ordinary living to reflect on sacrifice not only of the dead, of lives unlived, of the unfathomable grief but also of the living dealing with the trauma and moral injury of tooth and claw war. It is not a celebration which distracts.”
“I understand this perspective, but at the same time I ask myself — is there any harm in this form national reflection? I agree there have been some military follies following the absolute necessity of WWII, but would add that there is no guarantee that the next engagement is such,” a third wrote.",https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/military/no-longer-reflected-controversial-anzac-day-claim-goes-viral/news-story/73b149cdcb54b838a5ecbb5c79660551

According to popular site Downdetector, there was a massive spike in reports of outages beginning shortly after noon on Wednesday afternoon. 
User reports indicate Telstra is having problems since 12:29 PM AEST. https://t.co/V1gYKWq6C6 RT if you're also having problems #Telstradown
It appeared to be affecting access to internet, phone and Wi-Fi, although the issue was quickly resolved.
However, frustrated users wasted no time in taking to social media to slam the outage.
It is not yet known what has caused the latest issue, or how widespread the problem was.
However, individual users from Rose Bay in Sydney’s east to Coober Pedy in South Australia have confirmed separate outages in their areas.
“It seems like @Telstra are having some sort of mobile data outage in Rose Bay at the moment so I’ve resorted to connecting to the free Wi-Fi from one of their remaining telephone boxes,” one Twitter user posted this afternoon. 
“Nothing whatsoever in Coober Pedy, absolutely dead! Trying to get power connected as we just moved into a home and they’re unable due to the network outage,” another said.
Another Twitter user from Townsville has also reported two eftpos terminals have gone down, with CommBank confirming there were no current issues with terminals, and Telstra confirming it was looking into it.
“We had a brief network issue this afternoon that stopped some of our mobile customers from accessing the internet for a few minutes,” a Telstra spokesperson told news.com.au in a statement. 
“Calls and SMS weren’t affected at any stage.

The issue that began last night caused difficulties with making and receiving phone calls. 
However, Telstra assured its customers that calls to Triple-Zero and mobile data were unaffected.
The issue was reported nationwide on Monday night and Tuesday morning, but by Tuesday morning, the telco said it was limited to primarily limited to two states. 
“Majority of those affected are now in NSW and QLD,” Telstra said in an update at 8.30am. 
“Triple-0 calls continue to work where you have mobile coverage. We know you rely on your mobile, and we’ll keep you posted as we hear more.”

Customers were advised to switch aeroplane mode on and off or to try using Wi-Fi calling or other apps like FaceTime if they encounter problems. 
“We’re sorry for the late-night hassle for our customers,” an update on its website read. 
Customers, in particular business owners, vented their frustrations with the telco directly on its social media feeds. 
“Trying to run a business here – no phone,” one customer wrote directly to the company’s Twitter page.
“Cheers, Telstra, running a business, and the phone won’t take calls or make them,” another wrote.

15,twitter,news.com.au,2023-04-20,Elon Musk’s Starship rocket dramatically explodes seconds after launch,"The most powerful rocket ever built was successfully launched today, before dramatically exploding due to a technical hitch.
Elon Musk, the founder of the company behind the rocket, SpaceX, had previously given the launch a 50/50 chance of success.
Mr Musk only wanted the rocket to get off the ground and not destroy the pad – two markers which SpaceX can successfully tick off, The Sun reports. 
But an “unscheduled disassembly” saw the rocket explode before landing in the Mexican Gulf, according to SpaceX’s current diagnosis.
“Congrats SpaceX team on an exciting test launch of Starship!,” Mr Musk wrote on Twitter soon after.
“Learned a lot for next test launch in a few months.”
Congrats @SpaceX team on an exciting test launch of Starship!Learned a lot for next test launch in a few months. pic.twitter.com/gswdFut1dK
The debut orbital launch of the $4.4 billion next-generation spacecraft took place at the SpaceX’s Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas.
Over one million people tuned into SpaceX’s lifestream of the test launch.
The 33-engine, nearly 123 metre tall, rocket is the eccentric billionaire’s biggest feat yet.
Starship has been designed to be the vehicle that makes humans interplanetary.
It is expected to take humans to the Moon through Nasa’s Artemis mission in 2025, and eventually to Mars sometime in the 2030s.
The mega-rocket is designed to transport up to 100 people from Earth to the Moon and Mars, so will eventually have its interior kitted out to support humans on months-long space voyages.
The team didn’t bother decking out the interior as it would be on a Moon or Mars mission, as this edition of Starship was never intended to survive.
SpaceX and the US’ aerospace regulator the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) agreed on a splash down in the Mexican Gulf ocean with no recovery.
All boaters were banned from the waters below prior to the launch, to make room for the rocket’s so-called “belly flop” into the sea.
Today’s launch follows a failed attempt on Monday, which was due to a pressurisation issue, according to SpaceX at the time.
When Starship was scheduled to launch on Monday, the coastguard was forced to remove a boat from the water.
It is possible they would have received a hefty fine, or even had their boating licence revoked.
All rocket launches in the US are bound by environmental standards set by the FAA, which had previously stood in the way of the 33-engine rocket’s flight approval.
Instead of being recovered like it would be in future missions, what’s left of Starship will join its predecessors at the bottom of the pacific, where old rocket parts now act as artificial coral reefs for marine life.
However, it is likely most of the rocket burned up in the atmosphere.

Perth, in Western Australia, might be renowned for its slow-moving charm, but it has recently been given the title of being home to the country’s most stressed out drivers.
Motorists in Fremantle, about 20 kilometres southwest of the city, topped the charts for road raging drivers, with them accounting for 72.7 per cent of stressed out tweets, according to data collected by Budget Direct. 
Seven out of the top ten roads that caused the most stress were also in Western Australia, with Perth’s Reid Highway, Leach Highway and Welshpool Road scoring 100 per cent for stressful tweets. 
Behind them were WA’s Kwinana Freeway, Roe Highway, Tonkin Highway and the Mitchell Freeway, with the latter only over taken by Victoria’s Nepean Highway. 
The roads that caused the fewest stressed tweets were Victoria’s Tullamarine Freeway, the Dandenong Bypass, Warrigal Road, South Gippsland Highway and the West Gate Freeway. 
In equal pole position with Fremantle for having the most rage behind the wheel were drivers in Queensland’s coastal city of Mackay. 
Sentiment analysis tool TensiStrength found drivers in Mackay were also behind 72.7 per cent of driving-related Twitter rage. 
Behind it was Parramatta in NSW, Darwin in the Northern Territory, Wagga Wagga in NSW, Brisbane in Queensland, Byron Bay in NSW, Bendigo and Ballarat in Victoria, and Townsville in Queensland. 
While NSW and Victoria have the biggest population density, they didn’t even crack the top three in terms of states with the most angry driving tweets. 
Drivers in the Northern Territory were the worst offenders, with 63.2 per cent of driving-related tweets being stressed which according to Budget Direct, made it the state where drivers were “most likely to spark road rage”. 
Queensland was the next worse offender with 57.4 per cent, then the ACT, WA, NSW, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania, respectively.
Drivers who were the least stressed on the road lived in NSW’s Newcastle, with their stress rate tweets just 44 per cent. 
Surveyed Australians indicated they were most peeved on the road by dangerous driving, aggression, or rudeness from other motorists. 
Tasmanians were found to be the least irritable, based on combining the situations that make people feel angry or annoyed. 
Meanwhile, Queensland drivers were the most easily ticked off.
More than 70 per cent of Australians surveyed said they had another driver shout, swear, or rudely gesture at them while on the road in the previous 12 months. 
Western Australians were the most likely to experience with road, with just 34 per cent saying they had not been a victim of road rage in the past year.",https://www.news.com.au/technology/motoring/on-the-road/shocking-data-reveals-where-the-angriest-drivers-in-australia-live/news-story/5780785b3e3b7b5eff17d7d2bcc8dab2
17,twitter,news.com.au,2023-04-17,Fake ‘Chinese police car’ spotted in Melbourne,"A photo of a fake “Chinese police car” in Melbourne’s southeast has sparked outrage on social media.
The photo, uploaded to Reddit on Sunday, showed a dark Nissan sedan with Chinese characters for “police” stencilled on the bonnet and “special police” along the side, and a Chinese police badge on the front door.
“Why is there a marked Chinese police car in the southeastern suburbs of Melbourne?” user MediocreStream wrote along with the photo.
Reddit users quickly pointed out that the car was not actually affiliated with the Chinese government and that the markings were just decoration.
“Chinese students think it’s funny,” one wrote. “Source: I’m from over there. Also: It’s not funny. China is literally known to kidnap dissidents that aren’t even Chinese citizens anymore from overseas.”
It comes after a bombshell investigation last year revealed China was secretly running illegal “police stations” overseas, including at least one in Sydney, in order to harass and spy on its citizens living on foreign soil.
While the cars may not be officially affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party, many online said they still served a purpose.
“It’s passed off as cosplay but is used to intimidate local Chinese communities as an extension of CCP power,” one Reddit user wrote.
But another said, “Believe it or not, it’s just some young and stupid Chinese students showing off their stupidity. CCP intimidating programs usually involve threatening parents/children/relatives in China, not by showing some police cars. Source: I am Chinese Australian.”
A Victoria Police spokeswoman said she was unable to comment without more information about the time, date and location of the photo, and which station it was reported to.
Cars with similar markings were spotted in Adelaide and Perth in 2019, following rallies in Australia supporting Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrators.
At the time, WA Police said officers spoke to the driver of one of the vehicles who “stated he purchased the decals online” and “placed them on his car as a joke”.
After violent clashes between pro-Hong Kong and pro-China protesters at Adelaide’s Rundle Mall, the organiser of the rally told the ABC people felt “intimidated” by the car spotted around the city.

“I think it’s highly inappropriate, especially when you pretend to represent a foreign law enforcement unit in a Western country,” she told the broadcaster.
“Initially we thought it was a bit of a joke. We did receive reports of it a few days before our protest … Could this be an organised effort by the Chinese government or is it really just two completely separate instances of a prank?”
SA Police later tracked down the owner of the BMW. 
They would not reveal further details about the car or its owner but warned people to be careful if they were approached by anyone who arouses suspicion.
“While the markings on the BMW by themselves do not appear to constitute an offence, police are still making inquiries,” a police spokeswoman told The Advertiser.
The sightings sparked calls from the Greens at the time to tighten laws in the “grey area” around impersonating foreign police in Australia.
Political activist Drew Pavlou shared the latest photo on Twitter, writing, “It’s illegal to impersonate Australian police officers but somehow it’s fine to impersonate foreign police in Australia. We need legislation making it illegal to impersonate foreign police otherwise it is too easy for the CCP to intimidate and terrorise dissidents in Australia.”
Later on Monday he posted another photo a Jeep 4WD with the same insignia, which he said had been spotted on the NSW south coast by a follower of his page.
“While we are not able to verify the authenticity of the images provided, police have previously looked into reports of vehicles with similar insignia and no offence was identified,” a NSW Police spokeswoman said.

18,twitter,news.com.au,2023-04-20,"Fake Chinese police car in Melbourne: More photos, Victoria Police issue statement","More photos have emerged of a fake “Chinese police car” in Melbourne that sparked outrage on social media earlier this week.
The dark grey Nissan Altima sedan has Chinese characters for “police” stencilled on the bonnet and “special police” along the side, and a Chinese police badge on the front door.
A photo of the car in Melbourne’s southeast suburbs first went viral after being uploaded to Reddit on Sunday. 
“More photos of same fake Chinese police car in Australia, this time spotted in West Melbourne,” political activist Drew Pavlou wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, sharing two pictures of the same car parked on Adderley St.
“It is absolutely unacceptable to impersonate the Chinese police in Australia. Anonymous members of Chinese Australian community have sent this to me in fear.”
In another twist, a search of the Commercial Passenger Vehicles Victoria public register shows the car is an approved rideshare provider for platforms such as DiDi or Uber.
Some social media users said the decals, which can be purchased online for around $10, were sometimes put on cars by Chinese students who “think it’s funny”.
But others argued even though the cars might not be officially affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party, it was “passed off” as a joke but was “used to intimidate local Chinese communities as an extension of CCP power”.
Victoria Police on Thursday confirmed it was “aware of images of a vehicle in Melbourne which appears to have been fitted out with various unofficial decals to give the appearance that it is a Chinese government vehicle”.
“At this time no specific offences have been detected and we have not received any reports in relation to the matter,” a spokesman said.

It comes after a bombshell investigation last year revealed China was secretly running illegal “police stations” overseas, including at least one in Sydney, in order to harass and spy on its citizens living on foreign soil.
This week, authorities in the US arrested two men in connection with one such “secret Chinese police station”, funded by Beijing, operating in the heart of New York City.
Two US citizens were arrested and charged with conspiring to act as agents of the Chinese government and obstructing justice in connection with the New York site.
Harry Lu Jianwang, 61, and Chen Jinping, 59, appeared in court in Brooklyn on Monday. The pair allegedly operated the police station in Manhattan’s Chinatown district which was shut down late last year.
China has said the “police stations” were actually “overseas service centres” where Chinese citizens in the US could renew documents such as driving licences.
But US officials have said they were set up at the behest of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, claiming they undertook activities including identifying and harassing Chinese nationals in the US who were critical of the Communist Party regime.
Beijing hit back at the arrests and accused the US of “Cold War thinking” – a common rebuke from Chinese officials.
“China firmly opposes the US side’s slandering, smearing, engaging in political manipulation, and maliciously concocting the so-called transnational repression narrative,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters.

19,twitter,news.com.au,2023-04-18,15-minute cities: Woman’s bizarre claim about Victorian road project,"A 15-minute city conspiracy theorist has made a bold claim about the construction of multiple U-turn bays on a Victorian road, as debate over the urban-planning concept continues globally. 
In a video shared to Twitter, an Australian podcaster filmed herself driving along Narre Warren North Road which is situated 38km southeast of Melbourne and is currently undergoing upgrades.
The roadworks commenced in 2020 and are part of the state government’s Big Build project which entailed the addition of extra lanes, installation of traffic lights and road safety improvements. 
Final asphalting works, guardrail and signage installations, line markings and vegetation works are currently underway with the project expected to be completed by mid this year.
In line with the project, extra U-turn bays were created for safer and easier access to streets adjacent to the main road. 
However, the conspiracy theorist believes these turnaround lanes have been installed to serve a more dire purpose, believing more 15-minute or 20-minute cities are set to pop up in the future. 
Also known as smart cities, the notion is an urban development idea where everything you need access to is located within a short distance.
This may include schools, shops, GP clinics and even the office or your place of work, all within the same zone. 
The concept is the brainchild of Franco-Colombian urbanist Carlos Moreno who came up with the idea to prompt more sustainable, convenient and healthier living.
Key elements of the theory include keeping essential services close, creating a sense of community solidarity and inspiring green urban living.
However, not all are convinced, with some conspiracists comparing the theory to a Stalin-style plot to keep people in lockdown or under the government’s control.
In the case of the woman who filmed herself driving along Narre Warren North Road, she believes the road upgrade project will become a “Checkpoint Charlie” for smart cities.
“This used to be a country road. Not only are they building wires and towers but they’re also putting in interestingly three or four U-turn opportunities,” she explained in the video.
“I guess that’s because you’ll get a warning – you’re about to leave your 20-minute city, your district, your zone (and it’s your) last chance to turn back obviously before the fines start.”
As she drives further down the road, the woman highlights three “pillars with weird blue lights” positioned in the middle of the road next to several parked tradie cars. 
“Up here to the right you’ll see three bollards … I think this right here is the checkpoint,” she claims in the video. 
“There’s now all of these opportunities to pull a U-turn and go back the way you came.
“In the future, going out to the countryside is not something they’re going to allow you to do without you handing over your money.”
The tweet, which has received over 1.3 million views and 692 likes, has amassed debate over the urban planning concept online with many arguing the woman has taken her thoughts “too far”.
“This is ridiculous. U-turns, or access for emergency vehicles? Or both? Forget something and need to go back home? A U-turn is handy. This is not a nefarious thing,” one person tweeted.
“15 minute (cities) have been around for ages and have nothing to do with climate change lockdowns. It’s literally about ease of access and reducing dependency on cars,” a second person said.
“No one is preventing you from going further away in your car.”
A third comment read: “The wires reduce accidents. The breaks in the wire provide access points for emergency vehicles to turn. 
“These safety measures can be found on roads around Australia.”
Meanwhile, one man suggested the push for electric vehicles (EV) over petrol cars could be another excuse to restrict people to their “zone”.
“I’m thinking this is one of the major reasons they want EV versus gas vehicles, fewer and less range!” he said. 
The debate online follows huge rallies around the world as conspiracy theorists criticise the concept, which has already come into effect in 16 cities globally including Paris and Shanghai. 
Edmonton Canada was also another city which tried to implement the idea, however received backlash from its residents.
“You will spend 90 per cent of your life in this 15-minute area as they are monitoring your carbon footprint,” a flyer circulating warned.
Meanwhile, those who agree with the theory have slammed its critics, including registered nurse Christopher Patterson and national radio broadcaster Triple J Hack. 
“There are a lot of noted intellectuals on TikTok telling me I should be suspicious of convenience,” Triple J Hack reporter Shalailah Medhora said in a radio package last month. 
Dr Patterson, who is also a University of Wollongong lecturer, explained there are numerous health benefits to the theory that many sceptics are overlooking.
“The main (benefit) is giving people back their freedom (and) time,” Dr Patterson said.
“The time you get back you could put into (your) health or sitting in green spaces to connect back with your community and family.”",https://www.news.com.au/technology/motoring/on-the-road/checkpoint-charlie-woman-makes-wild-smart-city-claim-about-victorian-road/news-story/d5a6df870d6b7b29f73330371624b62c
0,twitter,Guardian,2023-05-12,From dealing with Musk to fixing Twitter Blue: what’s in the next CEO’s in-tray?,"Elon Musk has described it as a “painful” job that anyone would be “foolish” to accept. But Twitter’s current chief executive has found a willing person to take his place. Musk announced on Friday that he had appointed the chairman of of global advertising and partnerships at NBCUniversal, Linda Yaccarino, as CEO. Here are the most pressing items awaiting her when she takes up the post: Building a working relationship with Musk Musk is not going away. He owns Twitter and has put a considerable amount of money, as well as reputational capital, into a business he bought for $44bn last October. He also confirmed on Thursday that he would become executive chair at Twitter and take responsibility for a number of areas including the platform’s IT infrastructure. Investors in Tesla, where Musk remains chief executive, want him to spend more time at the electric car business but he has made clear that Twitter will still command a significant degree of his attention. Yaccarino has been described by the WSJ as a “hard-nosed” negotiator as well as a “velvet hammer”. Building a working relationship with Musk will test those people management skills. Luring back advertisers Twitter needs a chief executive who can command respect with advertisers, so the appointment of someone with a background in the field makes sense. Advertising accounted for more than 90% of Twitter’s $5.1bn revenue in 2021 and its contribution to the bottom line has plummeted since Musk’s takeover. Musk said in March he expected Twitter’s turnover to fall to less than $3bn this year, reflecting the damage caused to its relationship with the ad community after the takeover. There have been concerns about inappropriate content on the platform, loss of key personnel and a botched relaunch of the Twitter Blue premium product that led to a rash of impersonations of well-known brands and public figures. Boosting subscriber numbers Musk has been clear that subscription revenues are key to Twitter’s financial future. Its relaunched Twitter Blue offers a verified account – boosting the visibility of your posts in conversations and search – plus other perks such as fewer adverts, for $8 a month on the web, or $11 on iOS or Android in the US (it is also available in the UK and Australia). So far, take-up seems low, with about 600,000-635,000 subscribers, according to one estimate, out of a user base of more than 250 million people. That represents monthly income of about $5m a month – nowhere near enough to offset Twitter’s advertising slump. Preparing for “X, the everything app” The relaunch of Blue is part of a much bigger vision touted by Musk: shortly before buying Twitter, Musk tweeted that the platform would be “an accelerant to creating X, the everything app”. On Friday he said he looked forward to working with Yaccarino to transform Twitter into the all-encompassing app. In June, Musk reportedly told Twitter staff that he was an admirer of WeChat, the Chinese app that allows users to perform multiple functions from messaging to ordering a taxi and paying bills. “You basically live on WeChat in China. If we can recreate that with Twitter, we’ll be a great success,” the Verge reported him saying. But it is a big ask to achieve this in highly competitive markets such as the US, where “everything apps” have not succeeded. Handling regulators Twitter is under pressure on multiple regulatory fronts. The EU’s executive arm, the European Commission, has warned Musk that Twitter is in danger of not complying with the bloc’s digital services act, which regulates social media platforms. It must also adhere to the forthcoming UK online safety bill, which requires tech firms to protect users from harmful content. The US Federal Trade Commission is also investigating the company amid concerns that Twitter’s ability to protect users, and comply with a 2022 deal with the FTC to maintain high data security standards, might have been affected by redundancies and cost cuts. If Yaccarino is to convince the FTC that Twitter is not cutting corners on data security, then she will need to seek assurances from Musk, who declared on Thursday that he would also be Twitter’s chief technology officer. Managing costs and debt The financial structure of Musk’s takeover bid for Twitter involved $13bn of debt being placed on the company’s balance sheet. That is a lot of borrowing for a historically loss-making company. Musk warned in the early days of his ownership that Twitter was in danger of going bust, although he said in December that the company was “not on the fast lane to bankruptcy any more”. Annual costs have been reduced from $4.5bn to $1.5bn, according to Musk, but to make Twitter sustainable in the long term – and to make those $300m-per-quarter debt payments – the business needs to be consistently profitable.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/12/from-dealing-with-musk-to-fixing-twitter-blue-whats-in-the-next-ceos-in-tray
1,twitter,Guardian,2023-05-10,Tucker Carlson to revive show on Twitter after Fox News dismissal,"Tucker Carlson will be reviving his show on Twitter, after being abruptly dismissed from Fox News last month. In a tweet captioned “We’re back,” Carlson on Tuesday shared a video discussing his next moves. The former host said he would be taking his show to Twitter, which he described as “the last remaining platform in the world” to allow free speech. Carlson offered few details but promised a “new version of the show we’ve been doing for the last six and a half years”. He did not mention when the show may air. But he did echo many of the same points he has often asserted: that the so-called mainstream media is full of propaganda and lies. “Twitter is not a partisan site, everybody’s allowed here and we think that’s a good thing,” he said. “And yet, for the most part, the news that you see analyzed on Twitter comes from media organizations that are themselves thinly disguised propaganda outlets.” Carlson’s pivot to Twitter comes after the site has become more welcoming to mostly conservative accounts previously banned for spreading hate speech and disinformation under Elon Musk’s new direction. The billionaire took over the site in October 2022 and promptly allowed previously banished accounts to return, including that of Donald Trump. Carlson did not make any mention of Musk in his video. Twitter responded to a request for comment with a poop emoji. Musk, who has referred to himself as a “free speech absolutist”, tweeted on Tuesday: “We have not signed a deal of any kind whatsoever. Tucker is subject to the same rules &amp; rewards of all content creators.” It’s unclear what Carlson’s plans mean for his remaining contract with Fox, which runs until 2025. Typically, television companies include a no-compete clause when someone leaves the air. Axios reported on Tuesday that Carlson’s lawyers sent a letter to Fox accusing the network of fraud and breach of contract. The letter reportedly argued that the noncompete provision in Carlson’s contract with the network is no longer valid. Fox and and a representative for Carlson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. During the Trump presidency, Carlson had become one of the most successful hosts on the network, garnering a dedicated following while spouting xenophobic and racist rhetoric on his show. His show was terminated last month, in the aftermath of the $787.5m settlement of a $1.6bn defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems, over the broadcast of Donald Trump’s lies about voter fraud in his 2020 presidential race defeat by Joe Biden. Fox News has not commented on the reason for Carlson going off air. But multiple outlets have reported that abusive comments about executives contributed to the decision. Sources close to Carlson have disputed that. Since his departure, leaked videos and text message have shown Carlson making misogynistic and insinuating remarks; saying the Fox Nation streaming channel “sucks”; and calling a Dominion lawyer a “slimy motherfucker”. Following Carlson’s departure from Fox News, his former employers have replaced his popular show with an interim program called Fox News Tonight, which features rotating pundits from the network until a replacement can be found.

2,twitter,Guardian,2023-05-06,Twitter admits to ‘security incident’ involving Circles tweets,"A privacy breach at Twitter published tweets that were never supposed to be seen by anyone but the poster’s closest friends to the site at large, the company has admitted after weeks of stonewalling reports. The site’s Circles feature allows users to set an exclusive list of friends and post tweets that only they can read. Similar to Instagram’s Close Friends setting, it allows users to share private thoughts, explicit images or unprofessional statements without risking sharing them with their wider network. But, in an email to affected users seen by the Guardian, Twitter admitted tweets had escaped this containment. “A security incident that occurred earlier this year,” the email says, “may have allowed users outside of your Twitter Circle to see tweets that should have otherwise been limited to the Circle to which you were posting.” For weeks, users had been reporting Circles tweets receiving likes and views from accounts that should not have been able to see them. Twitter, whose press office has been largely destaffed and set to autoreply to requests for comment with a poo emoji, did not acknowledge the reports. Now, the company says the issue “was identified by our security team and immediately fixed so that these tweets were no longer visible outside of your Circle”. “Twitter is committed to protecting the privacy of the people who use our service, and we understand the risks that an incident like this can introduce and we deeply regret this happened,” the company said. The email did not address separate reports that similar privacy breaches were occurring to “private” accounts, whose tweets should not be displayed to anyone save for their approved followers. Since Elon Musk acquired the company in late 2022, Twitter has shed at least 60% of its headcount, with wave after wave of layoffs stripping teams to the bone. Over the same period, the site has experienced numerous outages, leading Musk to declare that it would not be stable until a “complete rewrite” of the site’s underlying code was completed. Similar cost-cutting measures have led the service to stop paying bills for office space, janitorial supplies and web hosting, with mixed success. Even as Musk attempted to institute a full return-to-the-office mandate, Twitter employees in countries including Singapore and London faced eviction from their workplaces over unpaid rent bills. More pressingly, layoffs in site-wide moderation teams have opened the company up to massive fines in countries including Germany, where effective content moderation is a legal requirement. The “systematic failure” of the social network to moderate well allows for fines of up to €50m (£44m) a case, the German lawyer Chan-jo Jun told TechCrunch last month.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/06/twitter-admits-to-security-incident-involving-circles-tweets
3,twitter,Guardian,2023-05-04,Best podcasts of the week: What really happened when Elon Musk took over Twitter,"Picks of the week Pod Save the UK Widely available, episodes weekly Given its hosts, this take on the popular US leftwing look at politics Pod Save America is inevitably great. Nish Kumar is one of our foremost political satirists and Guardian journalist Coco Khan is unfailingly witty about current affairs. It’s less a play for laughs than genuine analysis that’s full of withering putdowns on topics such as the immigration bill. Or as Khan puts it: “I love being oppressed by someone who looks like me!” Alexi Duggins Flipping the Bird: Elon vs Twitter Widely available, episodes weekly If you’ve been wondering what’s going on at Twitter, this new podcast from the makers of WeCrashed aims to investigate. From sackings to slowdowns, David Brown asks what Elon Musk’s motivation is and what will be left once he’s done with the social media platform. “It felt like everything was descending into chaos,” offers one ex-employee in a juicy interview. Hannah Verdier Proper Class Widely available, episodes weekly The podcast that celebrates all things working-class returns, with Laura Checkley and Hannah Chissick back at the helm. The first guest is comedian Susan Wokoma, who gets nostalgic about Elephant and Castle shopping centre. Future guests include Vicky McClure. Hollie Richardson Who Robs a Banksy? Widely available, episodes weekly Who would “kidnap” a Banksy sculpture and hold it to ransom, given how well-loved its creator is? “That’s such a fucking wanky, middle-class question!” exclaims artist (and former porn actor/rave organiser) Andy Link in this show’s intro. Its tale of the resulting 20-year battle is incredibly colourful, due in no small part to what an utterly compelling voice Link is. AD Past, Present, Future Widely available, episodes weekly David Runciman’s new podcast about the history of ideas gets off to a flying start with author Ian McEwan picking what he calls the best political novel: Italo Calvino’s The Watcher. It’s fascinating to hear him talk about the book that will “get you through a two-hour train ride”. Guests coming up include Zadie Smith, John Lanchester and Lea Ypi. HV There’s a podcast for that This week, Rachel Aroesti chooses five of the best podcasts about planet Earth, from a deep dive into our oceans to an experiential travel adventure Naturebang Presented by Becky Ripley and Emily Knight, two BBC Radio 4 documentary producers, Naturebang is – unsurprisingly – a show about nature and wildlife. Yet it’s one that is particularly well-suited to those who don’t normally gravitate towards straightforward science documentaries: each episode focuses on a natural phenomena and then asks how we might apply it to human society. Looking at bull elephants provides an opportunity to think about fatherhood; an investigation into the busyness of ants leads to a discussion of leisure time; and the traditions of the Great Tit allow for a meditation on cultural orthodoxy and immigration. Utterly fascinating, even if biology isn’t really your thing. Your Place or Mine Part fact-packed travel guide, part gentle parlour game, this pod sees guests attempt to convince presenter Shaun Keaveny that their chosen location is well worth a visit. Some of the places pitched are classic holiday destinations, but others are locales you may never have considered: comedian Daliso Chaponda suggests Lilongwe in Malawi; chef Ching He Huang chooses Taipei; actor Aatif Nawaz goes for Lahore. Despite the chat being divided into rather dry-sounding sections – weather, hazards, landmarks and travel – our wisecracking host and his knowledgeable sidekick, historian and geographer Iszi Lawrence, ensure that it is always shot through with silliness and fun. The Deep-Sea Podcast Considering that 71% of our planet’s surface is covered in water, this show may just be the most on-topic of all when it comes to podcasts about the earth. Hosted by long-time pals Dr Alan Jamieson, a world authority on the deepest levels of our oceans, and Dr Thomas Linley – an expert in deep-sea fish – this accessible and often exhilarating series covers topics from bioluminescence to seamounts in an attempt to overhaul the stereotype of the deep-sea as a terrifying, unknowable place. The pair have also attracted some surprisingly starry guests, including Titanic director and avid sea explorer James Cameron. Trees A Crowd The passion project of actor David Oakes (who can be seen playing Earl Godwin in Netflix’s Vikings: Valhalla), this show is indeed a detailed exploration of Britain’s trees – 56 different types of them, to be exact, from the much-worshipped Rowan to the anti-inflammatory Dogwood, the gloriously pink Spindle to the giant Aspen – but it’s also much more than that. The affable Oakes is frequently joined by those whose work is deeply entrenched in the natural world, including artists, zoologists, wildlife photographers, adventurers and activists, leading to conversations that feel like a brain-cleansing break from technology-riddled modern life. Armchair Explorer Traverse the wildest corners of the earth from your sofa with the help of this podcast from travel writer Aaron Millar, who encourages listeners to live vicariously through some of our most fearless explorers. Each episode is dedicated to an extraordinary adventure or adventurer: hear about Levison Wood’s perilous journey through the heart of the Middle East, Rebecca Stephens’ conquering of the Seven Summits, and comedian Andy Smart’s 72,000 miles of pan-European hitchhiking. Not all of the locations are far-flung, however – Nick Hunt’s recollections of a spooky hike in Scotland’s Cairngorms proves you can push the boundaries of travel relatively close to home.

4,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-30,"Twitter to let publishers charge users per article read, says Elon Musk","Twitter CEO Elon Musk said on Saturday that the social media platform will allow media publishers to charge users on a per-article basis with one click, calling it a win for both the public and media organisations. The feature, to be rolled out in May, will enable users who do not “sign up for a monthly subscription to pay a higher per article price for when they want to read an occasional article”, billionaire owner Musk tweeted. On Friday, Musk had said that Twitter will take a 10% cut on content subscriptions after the first year, noting that the company will not take a cut for the first 12 months. These subscriptions include long-form text and hours-long video. Since taking over the social media firm in October, Musk has been bringing in changes to try to boost revenue at Twitter after the social media platform saw advertising income drop last year in the run-up to his on-again-off-again acquisition that closed. Under Musk’s ownership Twitter has reduced its workforce from 7,500 people to about 1,500, leading to fears that moderation standards and its ability to comply with upcoming European standards would suffer as a consequence. Twitter has been repeatedly warned that it is not ready for a new European Union regulatory regime for monitoring digital platforms, with breaches risking a fine of 6% of global turnover and, in the most extreme cases, a temporary suspension of the service. Under the rules for large platforms, they must carry out annual risk assessments outlining the risks of harmful content such as disinformation, misogyny, harms to children and election manipulation. The moderation systems and measures put in place to mitigate those risks will also be checked by the EU. Platforms will also be banned from building profiles of child users for companies to target them with ads. Those platforms that can be reached by minors must also put in place measures to protect their privacy and keep them safe. Users must also be able to report illegal content easily.

5,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-28,‘One of the best superhero movies ever’: can The Flash live up to the Twitter hype?,"What a difference a few months makes. Talk as recently as September was that Andy Muschietti’s The Flash might be scrapped due to the legal and reputational difficulties faced by star Ezra Miller. Flash forward to the present day, and it is being called one of the greatest superhero movies of all time following a screening for press and cinema owners at Las Vegas’ CinemaCon this week. Let’s just put that into perspective. According to the assembled geekerati (who have only been given permission to tweet at this time), this is a movie that might just be up there with The Dark Knight, the original Superman, Black Panther, Avengers: Endgame and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. And it’s made not by all-conquering Marvel but Warner Bros-owned DC. This is the studio that gave us the original Suicide Squad movie, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League, all films that made even comic book fans wonder if they actually liked superhero films. It arrives with a new regime at DC Studios, led by former Marvel man James Gunn, with the promise that it will reset the DC multiverse in a way that allows us to forget everything we’ve seen before. Or at least, all the stuff Gunn doesn’t fancy moving forward with. The Flash is loosely based on the seminal Flashpoint comic book run, which saw Barry Allen waking up in an alternate reality where Superman is a frightened weakling, Batman is Thomas Wayne (Bruce’s dad) and the Amazons and Atlanteans are destructive forces who seem to be engaged in perpetual war. While Muschietti’s film is likely to cherry-pick from its source material, we do know that Miller will play two versions of The Flash (in the comics, the second Flash was the Reverse-Flash: in the film it will be a Flash from an alternate timeline). Michael Keaton will return to the role of the caped crusader, and so will Ben Affleck, while Sasha Calle is reportedly a revelation as Kara Zor-El/Supergirl. A new trailer, released this week with impeccable timing, shows us that the new film will see Allen “breaking the universe” and changing the past. It’s likely there will be ramifications for DC that go way beyond what we’ve yet seen in advance publicity. Frankly, this looks epic! The wonderful thing about multiverse movies is that they are primed and ready to explain away all kinds of superhero universe bad planning (of which there has been a lot at DC since 2013’s Man of Steel ushered in the Zack Snyder era) as simply the result of clashing alternate timelines. Moreover, if the new Supergirl does end up wowing audiences, or Michael Shannon’s General Zod gets the opportunity to shake the DC foundations that he should have received a decade ago, there is ample opportunity to bring them back in future episodes. Rumour is this will be Batfleck’s final turn in the cape and cowl, but if he’s well received – well there’s no reason that has to be set in stone. Perhaps that skulking, meat-headed guy with the guns from Dawn of Justice was just a bad Bruce Wayne from another universe where everything’s back to front and audiences love to turn up in their gazillions to watch really terrible movies. There are other reasons to be cheerful here. If the hype turns out to be true, The Flash may just present a much-needed blueprint for how to represent Batman (Batmen?) in ensemble comic book movies, a feat that nobody has ever really successfully achieved before (with the possible exception of Snyder’s director’s cut of Justice League). Now all we need is for Robert Pattinson’s dark knight to turn up, and it could be time to really get this superhero party started.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/28/one-of-the-best-superhero-movies-ever-can-the-flash-live-up-to-the-twitter-hype
6,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-25,‘Unprepared’ Twitter among tech firms to face tough new EU digital rules,"Twitter is among the tech firms that will face the toughest level of scrutiny under a new European Union regulatory regime for monitoring digital platforms, after warnings from Brussels that the Elon Musk-owned platform is unprepared for the new rules. The company, which Musk bought in October 2022, has been designated a “very large online platform” under the bloc’s Digital Services Act, which means complying with measures such as publishing an independent audit of its compliance with the legislation. It will be joined by 16 other major names including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Wikipedia, Snapchat and TikTok. Twitter has been repeatedly warned that it is not ready for the new rules, with breaches risking a fine of 6% of global turnover and, in the most extreme cases, a temporary suspension of the service. Under Musk’s ownership Twitter has reduced its workforce from 7,500 people to about 1,500, leading to fears that moderation standards and its ability to comply with the act would suffer as a consequence. In November last year, the EU’s commissioner for the internal market, Thierry Breton, implied that Twitter was in danger of non-compliance with the act, telling Musk that the company will have to raise its efforts to “pass the grade”. Breton added that Musk had “huge work ahead” to comply with the DSA. However, a readout of the November meeting with Musk added that the Tesla CEO had “committed to comply” with the DSA. In January, Breton again urged Musk to “progress towards full compliance with the DSA”, with Musk replying that the DSA’s goals of transparency, accountability and accurate information were aligned with Twitter’s. Under the rules for large platforms, they must carry out annual risk assessments outlining the risks of harmful content such as disinformation, misogyny, harms to children and election manipulation. The moderation systems and measures put in place to mitigate those risks will also be checked by the EU. The big platforms will also have to publish an independent audit of their compliance with the DSA, as well as how many people they employ in content moderation. They must also provide details of their algorithms and allow independent researchers to monitor compliance with the act. Platforms will also be banned from building profiles of child users for companies to target them with ads. Those platforms that can be reached by minors must also put in place measures to protect their privacy and keep them safe. Users must also be able to report illegal content easily. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, confirmed Twitter’s designation as a VLOP on Tuesday, while Google and Microsoft’s Bing will also have to comply with similarly strict regulations after being designated “very large search engines”. Tech platforms must reach at least 45 million monthly active users in the EU in order to be designated VLOPs or VLSEs. There are also regulations for smaller platforms such as publishing transparent terms and conditions. Breton said on Tuesday the “countdown is starting” for the companies designated with special status under the act. “Today is the D(SA)-Day for digital regulation,” he said. Guillaume Couneson, a partner at law firm Linklaters, said complying with the VLOP and VLSE provisions was a “challenge for everyone” and not just Twitter. The designated companies now have four months to comply with the act’s obligations including the first annual risk assessment. “It is not a long period of time to implement strict and in some cases burdensome obligations,” said Couneson.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/25/unprepared-twitter-among-tech-firms-to-face-tough-new-eu-digital-rules
7,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-24,Far-right Britain First party given Twitter gold tick,"Twitter has given a gold tick to Britain First, the far right political organisation, after a shake-up of its verification system under new owner Elon Musk. The party’s leader, Paul Golding, has also received a blue tick for his account, which means that his posts will be boosted in conversations and will be ranked higher in user searches. Golding was jailed in 2018 for religiously aggravated harassment. Twitter’s gold tick designates a verified organisation that is a business or non-profit entity, according to the platform’s website. Twitter is charging UK entities £1,140 a month for official gold tick status, while personal accounts are being charged £9.60 for a blue tick. Britain First, whose policies include prison terms for “any attempt to alter the demographic makeup of the British Isles”, had its account suspended in 2017, but it was allowed back on to the platform after Musk’s takeover last year. The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a campaign group, accused Twitter of promoting extreme content to drive controversy and user engagement with the aim of generating more revenue. “Twitter is now a topsy-turvy world where users have been told to ignore information supplied by good, reliable actors and pay undue attention to the bottom-feeders who want to spread hate, misinformation and sow division,” said Imran Ahmed, CEO of CCDH. “It’s harder and harder to know what to trust on the platform, while bad actors are put on a pedestal.” The Britain First account has 12,700 followers and Golding’s has 45,300. Twitter’s new paid-for verification system encountered more difficulties on Monday as the platform gave a gold tick to a fake Disney account, in the latest example of rogue actors launching “approved” parodies. An account with the handle @DisneyJuniorUK secured a gold tick on Monday morning. The account was suspended at 11.30am BST, but not before announcing that the cult animation series South Park was “officially heading to Disney Junior”. It was not clear whether the holder of the account – which had 2,087 followers – paid the $1,000-a-month cost for the tick or was given it for free. This has been happening with blue ticks for large personal accounts following the launch of a cull last week for legacy accounts that had not paid for verification. However, the account holder indicated surprise at receiving a tick on Monday, tweeting “No fucking way” and “This isn’t actually real right”. The user that claimed to be running the fake Disney account, @7virtues_, had tweeted a poll on Monday asking whether to deactivate the account “so I don’t get murked by the Disney hitmen”. Twitter’s previous attempt at charging for verification under new owner Elon Musk was pulled in November last year after the opportunity to pay for a verified account was hijacked by pranksters. A fake account representing pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly – which had paid for verification – announced free insulin, while the gaming firm Nintendo and the pope were among the other victims of impersonators. The impersonation issue was one of the drivers behind a fall in advertising revenue on Twitter since Musk’s October 2022 takeover. Advertising accounted for 90% of Twitter’s $5bn in annual revenue before the deal, and Musk revealed in February that he expects turnover at the company to be less than $3bn this year, suggesting a slump in its ad business. Disney declined to comment. It is understood that Disney, which stopped broadcasting the Disney Junior UK channel in 2020 and pulled the related Twitter handle at the same time, had contacted Twitter on Monday morning as soon at it was made aware of the account. A request for comment from Twitter’s press office on the Britain First and Disney Junior UK accounts was met with an automatically generated poo emoji, as is now standard for all journalistic queries directed at the company.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/24/far-right-britain-first-twitter-gold-tick
8,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-23,Twitter restores ‘blue tick’ free of charge to celebrities in U-turn,"Twitter has again U-turned over its verification policy, restoring the “blue tick” free of charge to celebrity users of the social network. But the site’s decision to reinstate the “verified” status without distinguishing between paid-for and free users has led to criticism for false advertising, since the boilerplate disclaimer for those users inaccurately describes their status as being granted “because they are subscribed to Twitter Blue”. The social network ended its old verification system on Friday 20 April, a date apparently chosen because of its significance in cannabis culture, and in the process stripped all “legacy” users of the blue checkmark that indicated their account was genuine. But the move, which left only those users who had paid for Twitter’s subscription service with a checkmark, had unforeseen consequences for Elon Musk, the social network’s owner and chief executive. Rather than encouraging pre-existing verified users to splash out the subscription fee, which starts at $8 a month, the overwhelming majority simply continued using the site. Public data shows that fewer than 500 of the 400,000 legacy users signed up, and almost as many users cancelled their subscription at the same time, for a net revenue increase of less than $300 a month. As a result, a blue tick on the social network rapidly came to mark out a user as paying for the privilege, leading to a grassroots campaign to “block the blue”, with users committing to blocking subscribers on sight. Not every user with a blue tick had paid for it themselves, however. On Friday, Musk revealed that three had received one for free: Stephen King, LeBron James and William Shatner. Over the weekend, that number drastically increased, with almost every celebrity user with more than 1 million followers receiving a new blue tick (with one notable exception: Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter and of the decentralised Twitter competitor Bluesky, who did not get a new verification mark). The rapid loss of social credibility for having such a mark, however, led many users to disclaim their new status. Re-verified users including the Guardian columnist Owen Jones, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Twitter comic dril all revealed that their new status had come without them paying for or requesting it. Other users have been unable to issue such statements. The actor Paul Walker, who died in 2013, the celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain, who died in 2018, and the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered by the Saudi state that same year, were all given “paid-for” verification. Some, including Jones and dril, wondered whether doing so, and marking their accounts as having “paid for” a service they did not, was plausibly illegal. “Isn’t it some form of defamation to falsely make it look like people have purchased a product associated with being a total loser,” asked Jones. (Dril joked that Musk had “fired the people in charge of telling him it’s illegal”.) English law protects celebrities against the tort of “passing off”, when individuals’ goodwill is harmed through misrepresentation. According to the solicitors Lewis Silkin, “in 2002, a landmark case established beyond doubt that celebrities can use passing off to protect the goodwill in their celebrity. Racing driver Eddie Irvine successfully sued TalkSport over a direct mailing piece which featured a photograph of him holding a portable radio which had the TalkSport name and logo on it. In fact, Irvine had been holding a mobile phone at the time the photo had been taken, but it had been digitally manipulated to replace the phone with the radio. “The judge decided that the advertisement clearly gave rise to a false impression of endorsement of the radio station by Irvine, and that the law of passing off should protect him from this infringement of his goodwill.” A request for comment to Twitter went unanswered save for the company’s standard automatic response, an emoji of a smiling poo.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/23/twitter-restores-blue-tick-free-of-charge-to-celebrities-in-u-turn
9,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-22,"Fake accounts, chaos and few sign-ups: the first day of Twitter Blue was messy","Friday marked the first full day Twitter’s new policies for verified accounts were applied – and the results were not pretty. Twenty-four hours after blue checkmarks began to disappear from formerly verified Twitter accounts, chaos reigned on the website, with impersonation and false information running rampant and few people signing up for the service the changes were meant to promote. The move came under new owner Elon Musk, who has pledged to make the struggling social media firm profitable by any means necessary – in this case, attempting to force users to pay for verification services that were previously free. Under the original blue-check system, Twitter had roughly 400,000 verified usersand checks meant that Twitter had verified that users were who they said they were. Under the new Twitter Blue program, individual users can pay $8 per month for a blue checkmark while organizations pay upwards of $1,000 monthly. The change has shifted the meaning of the check from an account that has been independently verified to one that paid a premium to help their tweets be seen by more people. The rollout – and its results – have been chaotic. Here’s where things stood on Friday: Elon taketh and he giveth away Several high profile Twitter users and celebrities lost their verification status on Thursday, including Beyoncé, Pope Francis, and Oprah Winfrey. President Donald Trump – who has not tweeted since he was allowed to return to the platform after being banned – has also been unverified. Some celebrity users – including basketball star LeBron James, author Stephen King and Star Trek’s William Shatner – pledged not to join Twitter Blue. All three still had blue checks on Friday after Musk said he paid for them himself. “My Twitter account says I’ve subscribed to Twitter Blue. I haven’t. My Twitter account says I’ve given a phone number. I haven’t,” wrote Stephen King on Twitter. “You’re welcome namaste,” replied Musk, who apparently gave it to the author for free. ‘Verified’ loses meaning Blue checks for users on Friday included a popup message noting the account “is verified because they are subscribed to Twitter Blue and verified their phone number”. But verifying a phone number simply means that the user has a phone number and they verified that they have access to it – it does not confirm the person’s identity, raising concern about the veracity of such accounts. Many took advantage of the new verification-free world on Twitter by changing their profile pictures and names to impersonate prominent figures, from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to the late Arizona Senator, John McCain. Others made prank tweets posing as legitimate news accounts to spread misinformation making fun of Musk. The ability to pose as legitimate organizations and figures raised concerns that Twitter could lose its status as a platform for getting accurate, up-to-date information from authentic sources, including in emergencies. Fake accounts claiming to represent the Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot, Chicago’s department of transportation and the Illinois department of transportation all began sharing messages early Friday falsely claiming that the city’s Lake Shore Drive – a major thoroughfare – would close to private traffic starting next month. The genuine accounts for Lightfoot and the transportation agencies did not have a blue or gray check mark as of Friday. Lightfoot’s office said the city is aware of the fake accounts and “working with Twitter to resolve this matter”. At least one was suspended Friday. And while is Twitter now offering gold checks for “verified organizations” and gray checks for government organizations and their affiliates, it was not always clear why some accounts had them Friday and others did not. Accounts from major transit systems in cities such as Paris and San Francisco as well as official weather trackers had lost their verification status as of Friday afternoon. Many impacted agencies said they were awaiting more clarity from Twitter, which has sharply curtailed its staff since Musk bought the San Francisco company for $44bn last year. Sloppy execution, few sign-ups The roll out of Twitter Blue – from user response to its execution – has been a flop. Some pointed out that it appears the blue checkmarks were not fully removed from Twitter’s system, flickering on and off for days before removal. Meanwhile, Twitter is continuing to push the program aggressively, telling advertisers that they are required to subscribe to Twitter Blue in order to continue running ads – at a time when cash flow from Twitter’s top advertisers has shrunk 65%. Twitter has seemingly yet to greatly benefit from the massive change in policy, with various calculations of its Twitter Blue subscribers showing any additional sign-ups under the new rules have been inconsequential. Independent researchers noted that according to publicly available information from Twitter’s API – which is now available by subscription only – there was only a net increase of 28 accounts on Twitter Blue in its first day when accounting for the number of people that unsubscribed. Another report put the number closer to 400 new accounts. An independent analysis from Travis Brown, a Berlin-based developer of software for tracking social media, found fewer than 5% of legacy verified accounts appear to have paid to join Twitter Blue. This story was amended on 24 April 2023 to reflect that there was a net increase of only 28 accounts the day of the Twitter Blue relaunch, when accounting for the number of cancelled subscriptions.

10,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-21,Why Elon Musk’s cull of Twitter ‘verified’ blue ticks could prove costly,"Twitter’s aristocracy is no more. Last year, Elon Musk described the verification process as a “lords &amp; peasants system” and on Thursday he deployed the guillotine. Feudalism has now given way to capitalism: money gets you status. In a long-threatened cull, famous names including Cristiano Ronaldo, Beyoncé, Kim Kardashian, JK Rowling and Sir Paul McCartney lost the blue ticks that confer verified status on accounts. On 1 November, shortly after buying the social media platform, Musk decried the system for verification, tweeting: “Twitter’s current lords &amp; peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark is bullshit.” Soon, he wrote, users would have to pay for accreditation, adding: “Power to the people!” Accounts affected by Thursday’s move had not signed up to the Twitter Blue subscription service, which costs from $8 a month in the US, £9.60 in the UK and A$13 in Australia, and is now the only way of securing that coveted blue tick – unless Musk chooses to cover the cost himself. The change has stripped the blue tick from about 400,000 legacy verified accounts. The blue tick is not just an honorific, however. Subscribers to the new service will get boosted rankings in conversations and search, while their replies will also receive greater prominence. Tweets that they interact with will also benefit. It means that maintaining influence or presence on the platform will cost money from now on, whereas it was free under the previous system whereby blue ticks reassured users that the accounts were who they said they were. However, Musk has said that users will still be able to see unverified accounts that they follow on the platform’s default For You feed. Some safeguards against imposter accounts – which bedevilled a previous Twitter Blue push – have been introduced, such as blocking new accounts from signing up to the service for 30 days. The Twitter Blue website page adds that the platform is “working on an updated process for new Twitter accounts in order to help minimise impersonation risks and may impose and change waiting periods for new accounts without notice”. Musk’s move is largely rooted in financial motivations, despite the anti-feudal rhetoric. When he tried to pull out of the deal to buy Twitter he argued he was doing so because he believed the platform was plagued by vexatious automated accounts. Twitter acknowledged the platform had a bot problem – largely related to pornography and cryptocurrency content – but Musk alleged it was much bigger than the company was letting on, meaning advertisers could not gauge whether they were receiving value for money. Under legal pressure from Twitter, Musk was forced to push ahead with the takeover but he remained adamant that bots were a problem and paid verification was the best solution. He said in his 1 November Twitter thread that giving paid-for verified accounts priority in replies, mentions and search was “essential to defeat spam/scam”, presumably under the logic that a bot account would not pay for a tick and would thus be less prominent. Musk is also determined to reduce Twitter’s dependence on advertising, something he has already achieved with a botched Blue relaunch in November that led to a slew of impersonation accounts that in turn contributed to an advertiser exodus (some advertisers had also expressed concerns about moderation standards post-takeover). In its last published set of accounts, advertising represented 90% of Twitter’s $5bn (£4bn) in annual revenue. According to Musk recently, revenue is due to drop to less than $3bn this year. Costs have also been slashed sharply, with staff numbers cut by about 75% to 1,500 people, which Musk says has seen off the threat of bankruptcy. But if advertisers do not return in force he will need more than the 600,000-635,000 Blue subscribers the platform is estimated to have, which equates to about $5m+ a month in revenue. Loss of verified status may persuade some users to pay up. According to the software developer Travis Brown, who tracks Twitter Blue subscriptions, the number of signups has risen from 550,000-585,000 at the start of the month to his latest estimate of up to 635,000. In the meantime, however, Twitter has to hope that this move does not damage a priceless but intangible commodity: trust. If Musk is replacing a feudal system, he needs to do it with a structure that will last. Journalists and commentators are among the thousands of accounts that lost their ticks on Thursday. “Twitter’s approach may help its business, but won’t help people identify who or what is worth listening to and the danger is that it will ultimately degrade trust that is critical for long-term sustainability,” says Nic Newman, a senior research associate at the Reuters Institute for the Study Journalism.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/21/elon-musk-twitter-cull-verified-blue-ticks-cost
11,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-21,Elon Musk pays for Stephen King and LeBron James to keep Twitter blue ticks,"Elon Musk has admitted he is paying for some prominent Twitter accounts to retain their blue ticks, as the social media platform launched a cull that stripped verified status from many famous names including Beyoncé, Ronaldo and Paul McCartney. Twitter’s owner confirmed the gesture after it emerged that the writer Stephen King, the actor William Shatner and the basketball star LeBron James had retained their ticks – which confer verified status on accounts – despite not signing up to Twitter Blue, the site’s subscription service. On Thursday Musk pushed ahead with a long-threatened promise to strip the blue tick from about 400,000 legacy verified accounts unless they signed up to Blue, which costs upwards of $8 a month in the US, £9.60 in the UK and A$13 in Australia. The overnight cull meant that many famous names, with millions of followers, lost their blue-check status. The names now without verified status include Beyoncé, Ronaldo, Kim Kardashian, Sir Paul McCartney, JK Rowling and Donald Trump. Twitter now has zero legacy verified accounts according to Travis Brown, a software developer who has been tracking Twitter’s subscription service, down from about 400,000 at the beginning of the month, with Blue sign-ups now at an estimated 630,000. Under Musk’s plans for Twitter Blue, subscribers’ replies will gain greater prominence in users’ default For You feed, while tweets you interact with will also be boosted. However, Twitter will continue to display accounts that people follow in their For You feed, whether or not they are Twitter Blue subscribers. Musk has said the switch to paid-for verification is necessary to eradicate automated bot accounts and generate an alternative source of income to advertising, which accounts for most of Twitter’s income. Gary Lineker, the Match of the Day presenter and prominent tweeter, confirmed to his 8.9 million followers on Friday that he had paid for a blue tick. Responding to a tweet by Jemima Khan, in which the screenwriter said she had paid for a Twitter Blue subscription and was now a member of the “uncool gang”, Lineker tweeted: “same here”. The tech news site the Verge reported on Thursday that a Twitter employee had emailed LeBron James recently to “extend a complimentary subscription to Twitter Blue for your account, @kingjames, on behalf of Elon Musk”. James, who has more than 52 million followers, had been a prominent opponent of paying for verification, stating last month that he “ain’t paying” for a blue check. King, the multimillion-selling writer of The Shining and It, expressed bafflement he now had a verified account that told followers clicking on his blue check that he was a Twitter Blue subscriber. He wrote: “My Twitter account says I’ve subscribed to Twitter Blue. I haven’t.” Musk, indicating he had stepped in on King’s behalf to help him retain his verified status, replied: “You’re welcome namaste.” Official organisations have had their blue checks replaced with a grey “official” tick, including the account for Pope Francis. Bellingcat, the investigative news outlet, said it had been offered a grey tick as its founder, Eliot Higgins, said he had not paid for his own blue check. He added: “I fully expect to be asked to pay for it in the near future.” However, some official sites such as the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services account did not have a grey tick as of Friday morning. Perks for Twitter Blue subscribers include the ability to edit tweets, write longer posts and see fewer adverts. There was also confusion over fake accounts, an issue that has dogged Musk’s attempts to introduce a verification system, with a false New York City government account tweeting at the authentic NYC government account that “THIS account is the only authentic Twitter account representing and run by the New York City Government”. The fake account was later suspended.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/21/elon-musk-pays-stephen-king-lebron-james-keep-twitter-blue-ticks
12,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-20,‘Legacy blue checks’ disappear from Twitter as Musk’s changes take effect,"Blue checkmarks began to disappear from formerly verified Twitter accounts on Thursday, as policies implemented under new owner Elon Musk began to take hold. Musk, who purchased the company for $44bn in 2022 and has thus far struggled to make it profitable, has been threatening to remove what he called “legacy blue checks” for months now. The checkmark previously denoted accounts that had been verified for authenticity and was given to accounts of celebrities, journalists and media outlets. Now users seeking verification will have to pay for Twitter Blue, a controversial $8 a month subscription program under which any account can obtain a blue checkmark. The rollout of the changes on Thursday was chaotic. Numerous high-profile users took to the platform to assert they would not pay for blue checkmarks under the new policy, while others announced they would leave the platform entirely. Nonprofit organizations Human Rights Watch and the NAACP have tweeted they will not be paying for Twitter Blue. SCOTUSblog, a news website that follows the workings of the US supreme court, said it would cease posting on Twitter entirely. The publication follows a similar move from NPR, the US radio network, which left Twitter last week after being labeled as a “state-affiliated media outlet” under new platform policies. The removal of free verification processes has also raised concerns about the risk of misinformation and impersonation of legitimate organizations and people. A plethora of false government accounts – including some posing as the US Internal Revenue Service amid tax-filing season – emerged on Thursday. Others changed their account photos and bios to impersonate prominent figures, with a fake Jeff Bezos tweeting he was dissolving Amazon and a fake John McCain tweeting that his plane had crashed (the Arizona senator died in 2018). Twitter has previously said that government entities could apply for a free blue check through a special program, but some have reported they had thus far been unable to do so. On Thursday, the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, the metro system in the San Francisco Bay Area, where Twitter’s headquarters are located, tweeted it had applied for such a checkmark but had not heard back from the company. Experts have stated that the failure to verify such entities increases the risks of scams and even threatens to collapse disaster response online, with agencies like the National Weather System now check-less. Impersonations have been a recurring problem since Musk took over the company. In November, the platform had to pause changes to the subscription program due to an influx of “verified” accounts posing as legitimate users and organizations.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/20/twitter-blue-checks-disappear-legacy-accounts-elon-musk
13,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-18,Thousands fled to Mastodon after Musk bought Twitter. Are they still ‘tooting’?,"When Elon Musk bought Twitter nearly six months ago, bringing back white supremacists and booting journalists who had criticized him, many users felt it was the right time to leave the platform. Thousands of tweeters – myself included – fled to Mastodon: a scrappy social media project designed from its start in 2016 to be resistant against takeovers by billionaires. Mastodon is decentralized: instead of a single website, it’s a network of thousands of independently run servers – each with their own moderators and users – who can interact with each other’s posts, called “toots”, using an open protocol called ActivityPub. Other social media services can connect to ActivityPub as well, so no one app can monopolize the broader network that Mastodon is part of, called the “fediverse”. All that posed a bit of a learning curve. In addition to learning the new terms, I had to carefully choose a server, which would determine who would be in charge of my data, and what toots I would see most often. Mastodon’s creator, a German programmer named Eugen Rochko, told me at the time that his creation could be “slightly more difficult to grasp” than Twitter. “But we’re not trying to be an exact copy,” he said. “We’re trying to make something better.” Musk has appeared threatened at times. In December, he banned links to Mastodon on Twitter and suspended users who posted their Mastodon handles, including Mastodon’s official account. Days later, he suddenly reversed course, calling the ban a “mistake” during a Twitter Spaces livestream. “Fucking post Mastodon all goddamn day long, I don’t care,” he said. Nearly half a year later, has Mastodon seized the momentum? Data shows that it saw a huge surge of interest late last year: its monthly active users increased more than eightfold to a high of 2.6 million about a month after Musk’s Twitter purchase. But that number has since dropped to just 1.2 million – a sign that Mastodon remains far from the levels of hype that would threaten a behemoth like Twitter. “It’s definitely the case that it’s slowed down,” says Nathan Schneider, a University of Colorado Boulder professor who researches collective ownership models and runs a small Mastodon server called social.coop. “I think a lot of people came and found it a little hard. Using Mastodon can feel like eating your vegetables.” Is bigger actually better? Some of Mastodon’s most passionate users – who tend to be more tech-savvy than average – say it’s no problem if the community stays small. Here, things aren’t designed to go viral quickly. There’s no global search or global hashtags. Servers can easily be made private, and admins can block other servers to combat trolls. There’s also a feature to put posts behind content warnings, which users are encouraged to do for sensitive topics. J Logan Carey, an illustrator, has a much smaller following on Mastodon than he did on Twitter, “but people seem to actually see the things I post on there whereas on Twitter I feel like everything gets algorithmically squashed unless you’re a brand or a celebrity”, he says. Brett Elliff, a systems engineer, says he has been “really loving” Mastodon after using it for a few months: “I only see what I want to follow, and there are actual conversations happening instead of people shouting into the ether.” And Tiffany Li, a technology attorney and law professor, says Mastodon’s small user base “means that there are fewer trolls and generally unpleasant people”. Another enthusiastic Mastodon adopter is Jeff Jarvis, a professor at the City University of New York’s Newmark Journalism School. Jarvis arranged for the school to fund a year’s worth of operating costs for journa.host, a Mastodon server home to a few thousand journalists who have been verified by volunteers. “I find the discourse in general to be richer and nicer,” Jarvis says about Mastodon. “I think mass media corrupted the internet with its definitions of scale, that you had to be huge because you had to get a big audience to go to advertisers.” Mastodon’s diminutive size has turned off digital marketers, who have mostly shunned it and other Twitter alternatives as niche “distractions” that would be a waste of ad dollars. But it’s also disappointing some activists searching for a way to get their message out without feeding Elon Musk’s machine. In January, Hannah Roditi, the executive director of Social Movement Technologies, a non-profit that provides digital tools training for progressive activists, hosted a Mastodon training session. It was the most popular session the group had ever hosted, with more than 600 attendees from over 100 countries. Attendees were tired of Twitter’s hate speech problem and opaque policies: some human rights campaigners had lost their accounts when their governments asked Twitter to take them down. But while Mastodon feels safer, Roditi finds it less useful. “We want to be able to hijack hashtags and get material in front of people instantly,” she says. “But a big portion of the world is on Twitter. They’re not on Mastodon. It’s more limiting.” Andrea Learned, the host of a climate podcast, has also found Mastodon too challenging. “I have been frustrated by how non-intuitive it is to make a list and follow other climate media,” she tells me over email. “We are all waiting for our various communities (in my case #BikeTwitter , urbanists, #PlantBased) to ‘land’ some one place. So – we all dabble on several platforms and no big momentum is seen.” ‘The homeowners’ association of social media’ Mastodon may be more of a village than a global arena – but that doesn’t mean it’s always welcoming. Johnathan Flowers, an assistant professor of philosophy at California State University Northridge, started a Mastodon account last November after Musk bought Twitter. But after he posted some observations about the racial politics of the platform, users demanded that Flowers, who is Black, hide those posts behind content warnings. “Their problem was that I wasn’t following the cultural codes that they felt should prevail in the digital space … [they felt there should be] a social entitlement to comfort around issues of race and racism,” he says. When he declined to use content warnings, he received a torrent of racist abuse in his inbox. “On Twitter, it took me a little over two years to say something that got me a bunch of racist trolls in my DMs and mentions,” he says. “On Mastodon, it took 48 hours.” The scholar was also hassled by users who were unhappy that he was using a tool to cross-post his posts from Twitter to Mastodon. “I’m just like, ‘What are you guys doing? Why are you being cops?’ There’s no wonder that we started calling Mastodon the homeowners’ association of social media,” he says. In February, Flowers brought up some of his observations to Rochko, Mastodon’s creator. “I am hopeful that it gave him a more nuanced perspective on the platform that he’s running,” Flowers says. “But as for whether it’ll spark real change, your guess is as good as mine. This isn’t a technical problem that one could fix with new features. This is a cultural problem.” (Rochko did not respond to a request to comment for this story.) These days, Flowers has mostly stopped using Mastodon, not necessarily over the race issue, but because its weak discovery and search features made it too hard to find the people he wanted to follow. “It took me weeks to find some of my best friends and academic colleagues,” he says. Now he logs in for two main reasons: to check on “the kind of interestingly diverse Star Trek community there,” and to look at cat pictures. Mastodon versus the monopolists Until recently, the Mastodon non-profit had just one full-time employee maintaining the software: Rochko. The organization is funded primarily through donations on Patreon, which add up to around $32,000 a month – a drop in the bucket compared with the trillions thrown around by tech giants. It’s also facing new competition from established names: Meta has said it’s working on its own decentralized social network, code-named P92, which will reportedly connect to ActivityPub. And Twitter’s co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey is getting ready to unveil Bluesky, a decentralized social media app that will come with a new protocol of its own. Despite this, Rochko has swatted away Silicon Valley investment offers worth “hundreds of thousands of dollars”, arguing that it would compromise his project. “Mastodon will not turn into everything you hate about Twitter,” he said. “The fact that it can be sold to a controversial billionaire, the fact that it can be shut down, go bankrupt and so on. It’s the difference in paradigms [between the platforms].” Schneider, the collective ownership researcher, says it’s heartening that Rochko refused the money. “If he took that investment, if it adopted that kind of monopolistic business model that venture capital tends to require, this would cease to be the thing that it’s meant to be.” But it doesn’t change the fact that there aren’t great alternative models. “It continues to reflect what remains my major anxiety of this whole moment, which is that we as a society are chronically incapable of investing in something better,” he says.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/18/mastodon-users-twitter-elon-musk-social-media
14,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-17,Canada’s CBC ‘pauses’ Twitter use after government-funded media label,"Prime minister Justin Trudeau has waded into a feud over Twitter’s decision to label Canada’s public broadcaster as “government-funded”, accusing his main political rival Pierre Poilievre of enlisting the help of tech executives in an attempt to defund the network. Last week, the Conservative leader called on Twitter owner Elon Musk to label the English-language feed of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s “government-funded” – but stopped short of asking for the French arm of the network to also be given the same label. On Monday, the broadcaster said it would “pause our activities on Twitter” after some of the network’s feeds started carrying the label “government-funded media”. Soon after, the account’s label was changed to “69% Government-funded Media” by Twitter. The label had previously read “70% Government-funded Media”, but Musk said the “Canadian Broadcasting Corp said they’re “less than 70% government-funded”, so we corrected the label”. “Our journalism is impartial and independent. To suggest otherwise is untrue. That is why we are pausing our activities on Twitter,” the CBC tweeted. Poilievre previously praised the decision, tweeting that “now people know that it is Trudeau propaganda, not news” and directing users to a Conservative party petition to defund the network, a long-running goal of the party. CBC has disputed the “government-funded” label, saying the broadcaster was “publicly funded through a parliamentary appropriation that is voted upon by all Members of Parliament”. Under the country’s Broadcast Act, the CBC is also guaranteed editorial independence. Radio-Canada, the immensely popular French language broadcaster, is funded through the same appropriations. Poilievre has not suggested he would defund the French language services, which he says provide a valuable resource for the linguistic minority. But political analysts also suggest the Conservative leader was hoping to avoid angering voters in Quebec, where he will need to perform well if he hopes to topple Trudeau in the next election. “Attacking this Canadian institution, attacking the culture and local content that is so important to so many Canadians, really indicates the values and the approach that Mr Poilievre is putting forward,” Trudeau told reporters on Monday. “In order to attack this institution that is important for many, many Canadians, he runs to American billionaires, the tech giants that they continue to defend.” Twitter owner Musk has made a number of controversial changes to the popular social networking site, including asking users to pay for “verified” blue accounts, revoking the verification of the New York Times and labeling broadcaster National Public Radio as “state-affiliated” media. The broadcaster announced last week it would leave Twitter in protest. Public TV broadcaster PBS also suspended tweets, citing the same reason. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also objected to Twitter labeling it as “government-funded media” on the company’s main account and Musk said the social media platform will now change the BBC’s label. When asked for comment on its decision to label CBC’s English language wing as “government-funded”, Twitter’s communications department responded to the Guardian with an auto-generated poop emoji.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/justin-trudeau-pierre-poilievre-twitter-cbc
15,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-17,Twitter labels Australia’s ABC news and SBS ‘government-funded media’,"Twitter has slapped a “government-funded media” label on the ABC and SBS. The social media platform led by Elon Musk has been labelling media organisations in a way that could imply they lack independence. The US’s Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio (NPR) stopped using Twitter after being labelled “state-affiliated media”, a tag that was later changed to ‘“government-funded media”. NPR said it would “no longer be active on Twitter because the platform is taking actions that undermine our credibility by falsely implying that we are not editorially independent”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The “state-affiliated media” tag had otherwise been applied to China’s Xinhua news agency and Russia’s RT outlet. Twitter said it was for accounts that are involved in geopolitics and diplomacy. Earlier this week, the BBC had its “government-funded” label changed to “publicly funded”. Twitter defines state-affiliated media as an “outlet where the state exercises control over editorial content”. Government-funded media refers to outlets “where the government provides some or all of the outlet’s funding and may have varying degrees of government involvement over editorial content”. Then there is publicly funded media, which refers to organisations that “receive funding from licence fees, individual contributions, public financing, and commercial financing”. A spokesperson said the ABC was not planning to follow NPR and PBS by quitting Twitter. “The ABC doesn’t currently have any plans to shut down all its Twitter accounts. We’re liaising with Twitter regarding changes to account verification and labels,” they said. An SBS spokesperson said labelling the company “publicly funded” would be more accurate. “While we appreciate Twitter’s motivations with regard to transparency on its platform, we believe a ‘publicly funded media’ label better reflects the hybrid public-commercial nature of our funding model and the fact that SBS retains full independence from government in our news editorial and content decision-making,” they said. Both media companies maintain full editorial independence from government, as set out in their charters. Since Musk acquired Twitter, the platform’s value appears to have halved and he axed half the company’s workforce. He has also come under fire for his plans to remove the blue ticks awarded to “authentic” accounts. There has also been some legal trouble, and a range of changes to how the site operates. Guardian Australia contacted Twitter for a comment and received what has been described as its “standard” response – a poop emoji.",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/17/twitter-labels-australias-abc-news-and-sbs-government-funded-media
16,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-16,Is the bird really freed? A look back at six months of Musk’s Twitter reign,"On 28 October 2022 Elon Musk tweeted “the bird is freed” as he marked his $44bn acquisition of Twitter. Nearly six months later, it became a dog. The distinctive avian logo the Tesla CEO had referenced in October had been replaced by a picture of a Shiba Inu canine – the face of the Dogecoin cryptocurrency. There was speculation over what was behind the change. Was it linked to a recent attempt to dismiss a $258bn lawsuit filed against Musk by Dogecoin investors over an alleged pyramid scheme? Was it a delayed April Fool’s gag? Whatever the reason, the dog has now gone. But the episode was exemplary of Musk’s decision-making style at the social media company: erratic, and sometimes, inscrutable in motivation. As we approach six months of Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, it remains far from business as usual at the company. In the past week alone, there has been a spat with Substack, further problems with the site’s infrastructure and NPR, the US radio network, has quit the platform. Musk himself admitted in an interview with the BBC that running Twitter had been “painful” and that buying it had come with “emotional strain”. Here’s a look at how key areas of Twitter’s business have performed. Debt and company value The end of the month does not just mark six months since Musk’s purchase, it is also the due date for the second quarterly instalment on paying down Twitter’s $13bn debt burden (a payment of about $300m). When the first payment approached in January, it was against a backdrop of doom-laden warnings from Musk, who had cautioned shortly after the takeover that “bankruptcy isn’t out of the question”. True, Musk had paid $44bn for a business that had been largely loss-making since its launch in 2006. But his own decisions at the platform had led to an advertiser boycott that had caused significant damage to the platform’s main source of revenue (more than $5bn in 2021). Last month it emerged that Twitter is now worth less than half of what Musk paid for it, having lost more than $20bn (£16.4bn) in value, according to calculations based on a leaked memo. Financial performance Once at the helm, Musk slashed costs and, last month, the CEO said he thought Twitter had a chance of turning cashflow positive – broadly, spending less cash to run the business than it takes in – in the current quarter. He repeated the claim in the BBC interview. In March he told a Morgan Stanley conference in San Francisco that Twitter’s revenue was due to drop to less than $3bn this year but expenditure had dropped from $4.5bn to $1.5bn. Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, says Musk’s high-risk approach could pay off for a platform that was struggling for financial stability even before the chaotic takeover. “Twitter has always been a basket case as a business, unable to monetize its users into advertising revenues and the status quo was getting them nowhere,” he says. “Musk, as is his wont, has been a chaos agent, unfocused and unpredictable, but I would think that Twitter stands a chance of making it out of the forest, precisely because of this chaos.” Indeed, Musk recently folded Twitter into an entity called X Corp. Musk has referred to Twitter as being an “accelerant” for creating X, his “everything app” akin to WeChat in China. User base A self-declared“free speech absolutist”, Musk early on chose to reinstate accounts that had been banned under the platform’s previous owners. Those included the accounts for Donald Trump, misogynist influencer Andrew Tate and the personal account of the far-right US congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. According to Musk, users have not fled the platform in response. Musk said in November that Twitter’s user numbers had crossed 250 million, up from 238 million before the takeover. The controversy around account reinstatement, the threat of losing blue-check status and Musk’s dislike of mainstream media, including banning some prominent reporters, also do not seem to have deterred the journalists and influential pundits who use the platform regularly (see the Gary Lineker tweet that drove a whole news cycle recently). “Despite all the talk that journalists would be leaving Twitter, in practice very few have done so because it remains an important part of workflows, with networks that have been built up and carefully curated over the years – as well as being a compelling and amusing distraction,” says Nic Newman, a senior research associate at the Reuters Institute for the Study Journalism. “Our data suggests that there has been no substantial drop-off in the number of people that use it weekly – though that may well come.” Staff In an effort to dramatically cut costs, Musk axed half of the company’s 7,500-strong workforce within days of sealing the takeover and reduced it further through a series of cuts including a bizarre redundancy program where staff were asked to commit to being “hardcore” or leave. Such was the chaotic reaction to that ultimatum, Twitter was forced to shut offices temporarily. According to one former employee who was made redundant following the takeover, the platform has gone backwards. “For many of us former tweeps, seeing what Musk is doing to Twitter is heartbreaking,” said the former staff member, speaking on condition of anonymity. “The platform has regressed in terms of toxicity, safety and nuance. The hard work of dedicated teams and colleagues over the years has been erased, including efforts to combat misinformation and create trustworthy safety policies and curation standards.” Advertisers Concerns over Musk’s erratic decision making, approach to content moderation and a botched relaunch of Twitter’s Blue subscription service underlined Musk’s revenue projections last month. At one point in January, the company’s daily revenue was down 40% year-over-year, according to the tech newsletter the Platformer and some boycotts remain in place. Pharmaceutical firms Eli Lilly and Pfizer, retailer Macy’s and Cadbury owner Mondēlez spent no money on Twitter in the first two months of the year, according to the advertising data firm MediaRadar. However, MediaRadar said there were 3,700 companies advertising on Twitter in February – 8% more than the same period last year (although some, like Volkswagen, General Motors and Chipotle, have reduced their spending significantly). Nonetheless, there are signs of life. “Just this past couple of weeks we’ve seen the first signs of recovery, as a few advertisers are now talking about Twitter ads again,” says Farhad Divecha, the managing director of the UK digital marketing agency AccuraCast. “They’re now coming to us asking about it, rather than us asking them if they’re ready to reconsider Twitter – and them declining. Twitter Blue relaunch Determined to reduce Twitter’s reliance on advertising, Musk has invested big in the relaunch of Twitter’s subscription services. The first relaunch of Twitter Blue, in November, was paused after it led to a slew of fake “verified” accounts. The company tried again in December, offering subscribers perks such as a blue tick – giving your account more prominence on the For You feed – and fewer adverts for $8 a month on the web or $11 on iOS or Android. According to Travis Brown, a software developer who has been tracking Twitter’s subscription service, the new-look Blue has about 550-585,000 subscribers which equates to $4m+ a month in revenue. Twitter will need many more sign-ups to offset the advertising loss. Meanwhile, the 400,000 legacy blue checks face a loss of status. Musk told the BBC that these checks will be phased out by next week, although a deadline has been missed before. Site performance and regulators Twitter has been hit by a series of outages since it was bought. In the latest breach, users reported that Twitter’s privacy-friendly Circles feature was leaking private user data. The US Federal Trade Commission is investigating the company amid concerns that Twitter’s ability to protect users, and comply with a 2022 deal with the FTC to maintain high data security standards, might have been affected by redundancies and cost cuts. “The FTC’s investigation is quite serious,” says David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. “There is deep concern within the FTC as to whether Twitter is, in fact, making a concerted effort to bring it into compliance with the May 2022 consent decree.” Vladeck says that unless Twitter “ups its game” another enforcement action, including “substantial civil penalties”, looms. An emailed request for comment sent to Twitter’s press office was met, as is now standard practice at the company, with a poop emoji.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/16/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-six-months
17,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-15,Elon Musk hates journalists but journalists love Twitter. Where does that leave us? | John Naughton,"Last October, the richest manchild in human history fell into the trap he had dug for himself. Elon Musk was forced to purchase Twitter at an absurd price. He had no clear idea of what to do with his new acquisition, other than realising a fatuous idea about “free speech”. It was like watching a monkey acquire a delicate clock: the new owner started thrashing wildly about, slashing the headcount (from 8,000 to about 1,500) – in the process losing many of the people who knew how the machine worked – and generally having tantrums while tweeting incontinently from the smallest room in the company’s San Francisco headquarters. All of this frenetic activity was watched – and avidly reported for weeks – by the world’s mainstream media, for reasons that would have puzzled a visiting Martian anthropologist. After all, in relation to the other social-media companies, Twitter looked like a minnow. Most people have never used it. So why all the fuss about its acquisition by a flake of Cadbury proportions? The answer is that there is a select category of humans who are obsessive users of Twitter: politicians; people who work in advertising, PR and “communications”; and journalists. These are people who spend every waking moment on the platform, and use it to disseminate information, argue, troll, boast and engage in relentless virtue-signalling. Given that some (many?) of these people work in media, their obsession with Twitter meant that it had become, de facto, a significant part of the public sphere. If you wanted to be anyone in that networked world, you had to be on Twitter. The person who understood this best was Donald Trump, who was an inspired maestro of the medium. He campaigned on Twitter, and eventually even governed by tweet – to the extent that some genius created a bot that automatically reformatted every tweet Trump issued as president as an official-looking White House press statement. When Musk embarked on his chaotic attempts to mould the platform to his liking, there was a stampede of advertisers and disaffected users from it. The former sat on their corporate hands, worried about brands being tainted by the racist and xenophobic hordes that Musk allowed on to the platform; the latter went to Mastodon which, though superficially similar to Twitter, is actually very different – it’s a decentralised federation of independently run servers. Mastodon is fine for some purposes. For one thing, it’s somehow quieter and more conversational. For another, it’s not algorithmically curated, so you only see posts from people you have chosen to follow. And though it does have some journalists on it, most of them seem to have hedged their bets – in that they have also remained on Twitter. And I can see why: if you are interested in reaching the widest possible audience for your humblebragging or even news of your latest scoop, then – because of its decentralised architecture – Mastodon doesn’t have the “reach” that you crave. Which means that, no matter how depraved Twitter becomes under its reigning proprietor, you have to be there, even if he despises you. Which he does. After he fired all the company’s press team, for example, replies to media inquiries consist of an automated poo emoji. So, as tech journalist Casey Newton observes in “Why journalists can’t quit Twitter”: “The company was symbolically shitting all over them, and journalists couldn’t get enough of it.” Which brings us, oddly enough, to the UK and Keir Starmer’s Labour party, which is suddenly displaying a perceptive understanding of how to use Twitter for political purposes. Exhibit A is a Labour advertisement that everybody in politics has been talking about for at least a week: a photograph of Rishi Sunak accompanying the text: “Do you think adults convicted of sexually assaulting children should go to prison? Rishi Sunak doesn’t.” Under the Tories, the ad continued, “4,500 adults convicted of sexually assaulting children under 16 served no prison time.” The interesting thing is that the advert was posted only on the party’s Twitter feed – and not on Facebook or other social media sites that account for the majority of party-political online advertising in the run-up to elections. The ad was seen by more than 22 million people – in itself a formidable achievement in a world where most people pay no attention to politics. But more importantly, it was seen by every journalist in the country, which is why so many people have been talking about it ever since. All of which suggests that unless Musk succeeds in actually demolishing his new toy, mainstream media will continue to be glued to it. None of the available alternatives look like a convincing replacement for it. And yet it’s clear that the world would miss Twitter if it disappeared. So maybe, as with death and taxes, we are stuck with it.

18,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-14,PBS quits Twitter after being labeled ‘government-funded media’,"The US’s Public Broadcasting Service, better known as PBS, has quit its use of Twitter after the platform labeled the organization as “government-funded media”. PBS’s announced its Twitter exit on Thursday, one day after National Public Radio also left the platform amid comments by the Twitter owner, Elon Musk, that NPR was “state-affiliated media” which should be defunded. Twitter has since relabeled NPR as “government-funded media”, but that did not stop the radio broadcaster saying that the labels for it and the television broadcaster PBS were aimed at undermining their credibility as independent news outlets. The labels are shared by Russia Today and China’s Xinhua, whose editorial decisions are heavily influenced by their respective state regimes, as USA Today noted. Meanwhile, both NPR and PBS fall in the middle – or neutral – part of the Ad Fontes media bias chart. A PBS spokesperson said the broadcaster does receive some government subsidies but gets far more from members of the public and from philanthropic organizations. While it does receive government subsidies, NPR says most of its funding comes from corporate as well as individual supporters and grants. United Press International noted Twitter has not labeled the accounts for the Musk-owned SpaceX and Tesla companies as government-affiliated organizations despite receiving billions in government subsidies. In a statement to USA Today, Jason Phelps of PBS said the broadcaster’s staffers stopped using the organization’s Twitter account after learning that the platform had relabeled them. Phelps said PBS had “no plans to resume at this time” but added that the organization was “continuing to monitor the ever-changing situation closely”. “Twitter’s simplistic label leaves the inaccurate impression that PBS is wholly funded by the federal government,” Phelps added to USA Today. In a separate statement, PBS said that “editorial independence is central to our work, and will never change”. “We will continue to produce trustworthy content that features unbiased reporting and holds governments and institutions to account,” the PBS spokesperson’s statement added. The BBC was also recently labeled government-funded media by Twitter, but the platform relabeled it “publicly funded” after the BBC complained. The BBC remains on Twitter. UK households fund the BBC through a TV license fee, and commercial operations also provide income to the broadcaster, which operates through a royal charter with the British government that requires the broadcaster to be independent.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/14/pbs-quits-twitter-government-funded-media-label-npr
19,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-12,NPR to quit Twitter after being labelled ‘state-affiliated media’,"National Public Radio (NPR) said on Wednesday it will no longer post fresh content to its 52 official Twitter feeds after the US organization was labeled as “state-affiliated media” by the social media platform. “We are officially de-emphasizing Twitter across the organization,” NPR said in a statement, adding that it had made the decision after Twitter refused repeated requests to remove the “inaccurate label”. Public TV broadcaster PBS also suspended tweets, citing the same reason. A PBS spokesman, Jeremy Gaines, told the Washington Post: “We don’t have any plans to return.” The broadcaster did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for a comment. Twitter labeled both public media organizations as “state-affiliated media” before changing the wording to “government-funded media”. The BBC and Voice of America were also tagged. Twitter was not immediately available for comment. Before a takeover of Twitter by Elon Musk, the label was reserved for propaganda networks like Russia’s RT and China’s Xinhua News Agency. NPR is a non-profit media organization, based in Washington, that syndicates more than 1,000 local public radio stations across the US. Some public radio stations – including KCRW in Santa Monica, California, and WESA in Pittsburgh – also announced they would stop using the platform, though affiliated member stations were not tagged as “government funded”. The majority of NPR’s funding comes from corporate and individual supporters and grants. The organization also receives programming fees from various member stations. The member stations receive about 13% of their funds from the federally funded Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other state and federal government sources, NPR said. “The whole point isn’t whether or not we’re government funded,” said the organization’s CEO, John Lansing. “Even if we were government funded, which we’re not, the point is the independence, because all journalism has revenue of some sort.” Lansing echoed his message in a staff-wide email, saying: “It would be a disservice to the serious work you all do here to continue to share it on a platform that is associating the federal charter for public media with an abandoning of editorial independence or standards.” The organization is setting up a two-week grace period so social media managers that run its accounts can revise their social media strategies. According to Lansing, NPR staff can decide for themselves whether they will continue remaining active on the platform. The organization’s decision has prompted a slew of responses online, including from its own journalists. Scott Detrow, NPR’s White House correspondent, wrote: “NPR is stepping away from Twitter. It’s the right move and I’m proud of us for taking it.” Geoff Brumfiel, an editor and correspondent on NPR’s science desk, tweeted: “Twitter doesn’t make or break anything we do as an organization, and so there’s not much benefit for staying.” Meanwhile, the Committee to Protect Journalists has called on Twitter to reconsider its decision, with its program director, Carlos Martínez de la Serna, saying “it is imperative”. “NPR receives public funding, but is not state-controlled, meaning Twitter’s listing could pose risks for journalists reporting from areas where suggestions of government affiliation have negative connotations,” he said. Barry Malone, the deputy editor in chief of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, tweeted: “NPR leaves Twitter – the first major media org to do so. An influential newsroom with almost 9 million followers. Hard not to interpret this as a big blow to the platform.” The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) had also objected to Twitter labeling it as “government-funded media” on the company’s main account. Elon Musk, Twitter’s billionaire owner, said the social media platform will now change the BBC’s label after the broadcaster objected. In an interview with the BBC, Musk said he had the “utmost respect” for the outlet. “We want [the tag] as truthful and accurate as possible. We’re adjusting the label to [the BBC being] publicly funded. We’ll try to be accurate,” he added. The Tesla, Twitter and SpaceX chief made the announcement during a wide-ranging interview with the BBC in which he said that his pain level from running the site had been “extremely high” but that the business was now “roughly breaking even”.",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/12/npr-leaves-twitter-elon-musk-state-media
20,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-11,Twitter forced to remove harmful content aimed at Brittany Higgins and partner,"Australia’s eSafety commissioner deployed tough new cyber abuse powers for the first time to force Twitter to remove severely harmful content targeting Brittany Higgins and her partner, David Sharaz, last year. Sharaz lodged a formal complaint to the office of eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, in April last year, asking for an investigation of vitriolic content that Twitter was refusing to act upon, according to correspondence seen by Guardian Australia. His complaint singled out a highly offensive tweet – which the Guardian has chosen not to republish – that exemplified the widespread abuse and harassment the pair have suffered online. The commissioner acted quickly in response and intervened using new adult cyber abuse powers to issue a formal notice to Twitter to remove the content. It was the first time the eSafety commissioner had issued such a notice since the Online Safety Act was enacted in January 2022. The laws allow the commissioner to compel major social media platforms to remove material her office deems to be severe “cyber‑abuse material targeted at an Australian adult”. The powers can only be used where a platform has refused to act on content that an ordinary person would believe was “intended to have an effect of causing serious harm to a particular Australian adult” and would “regard the material as being, in all the circumstances, menacing, harassing or offensive”. Upon receipt of the notice, Twitter took down the abusive tweet within 24 hours. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The eSafety commissioner said it could not comment on individual complaints, but its intervention, until then unprecedented, shows the seriousness of the abuse directed at Higgins and Sharaz. A spokesperson for the commissioner said more generally that it had only used the powers six times since they were enacted roughly one year ago. In each of the six cases, the commissioner’s intervention had resulted in either the removal of material or geo-blocking the content. “The adult cyber abuse scheme gives Australian adults somewhere to turn if an online service provider has failed to act on a report of seriously harmful online abuse,” a spokesperson said. “Adult cyber abuse can have a long-lasting impact on the targeted person’s sense of safety, self-esteem, mental health and physical wellbeing, especially when part of a broader pattern of abuse and harassment.” The reforms enacted last year also gave the eSafety commissioner broader powers to act on cyberbullying. Inman Grant, the eSafety commissioner, has previously told the Guardian that her agency had probed more than 1,680 cyberbullying complaints and made more than 500 removal requests to online platforms in the first 12 months since the Online Safety Act changes. Bruce Lehrmann’s defamation proceedings against News Corp and Network Ten are set to be brought back to the federal court on 28 April for a key ruling that will determine whether his case can proceed. Lehrmann is seeking to extend the usual 12-month time limit that applies to defamation proceedings so that he can sue News Corp and Network Ten for their initial reporting of Higgins’ allegations of rape – allegations he has always denied. At a hearing last month, Lehrmann argued that he was delayed in bringing proceedings due to prior legal advice, the prospect of a criminal trial and his mental health. But lawyers for News Corp, Network Ten, Samantha Maiden and Lisa Wilkinson argued it was not reasonable for Lehrmann to have delayed the proceedings, saying he did nothing, despite being “acutely aware” that he was in a position to sue for defamation. Justice Michael Lee will hand down his decision at midday on 28 April. Lehrmann pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual intercourse without consent. His first trial in the ACT supreme court was aborted due to juror misconduct, and prosecutors did not proceed with a retrial due to fears over Higgins’s mental health.",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/12/twitter-forced-to-remove-harmful-content-aimed-at-brittany-higgins-and-partner
21,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-11,Row between Twitter and Substack ends with uneasy truce,"A six-day row between Twitter and Substack has come to an uneasy truce after the social media site stopped censoring links and searches for the newsletter platform following the latter’s decision to launch a rival microblogging service. However, the spat appears to have put an end to Elon Musk’s “Twitter Files” project, after he tweeted then deleted screenshots of a conversation between himself and one of its writers, Matt Taibbi, in which the pair sparred over the censorship. The conflict started last Wednesday, when Substack announced a new feature, “Substack Notes”, which offers a Twitter-like experience for the company’s user base of newsletter authors and their readers, some of whom are paying subscribers. “While Notes may look like familiar social media feeds, the key difference is in what you don’t see,” said the Substack cofounder Hamish McKenzie in a post announcing the feature. “The Substack network runs on paid subscriptions, not ads. This changes everything. “Here, people get rewarded for respecting the trust and attention of their audiences. The ultimate goal on this platform is to convert casual readers into paying subscribers. “In this system, the vast majority of the financial rewards go to the creators of the content.” Many Substack authors rely on Twitter for both reader acquisition and content to write about, leaving the newsletter platform in a painful position if Musk’s chaotic administration of Twitter since his $44bn (£38bn) takeover last October were to lead to the social network’s collapse. Even before the Twitter sale, Substack had been struggling: the company’s 2021 revenues were negative, according to its financial statements, and it lost $25m in cash overall that year. Last year, it fired one in six staff members and last month it turned to retail investors for a fundraising round, despite having been valued at $650m in March 2021. In a statement, the company denied it was in difficulty, telling the Guardian: “The financials shared are nearly 18 months old, and the company has transformed materially since then. “In the period 2020 to 2022, Substack focused on growth. In particular, during this period we made aggressive investments to acquire writers who had large readerships so we could kickstart the growth of the Substack network. This effort brought tens of millions of readers into the system. Now, Substack has more than 35 million active subscriptions, including 2 million paid subscriptions. More than 17,000 people are earning money on Substack, and the top 10 writers earn more than $25 million.” But the company’s efforts to compete with Twitter brought an immediate response from Musk himself. Over the Easter weekend, any tweet containing a Substack link was algorithmically deprioritised, blocked from being liked or retweeted, and hidden in search. Searches for the term “substack” itself were automatically replaced with searches for the word “newsletter”. And many users who did manage to find and click on a link to a Substack site reported being warned by Twitter that the service was “unsafe or malicious”. “We’re disappointed that Twitter has chosen to restrict writers’ ability to share their work,” the Substack founders said in a joint statement. “Their livelihoods should not be tied to platforms where they don’t own their relationship with their audience, and where the rules can change on a whim.” Taibbi, one of the most prominent writers on Substack, found himself in the middle of that conflict. Despite working closely with Musk on the Twitter Files – a selective publication of internal Twitter documents authorised by Musk with the apparent goal of demonstrating liberal bias under its former management – he said he would be leaving the platform over the restrictions. That departure prompted a response from Musk, the company’s first public statement on the matter, days after the first reprisals against Substack had been noticed: Musk falsely accused Taibbi of being a Substack employee (he is not), claimed Substack links “were never blocked” (he later admitted they were temporarily marked as “unsafe”), and accused Substack of “trying to download a massive portion of the Twitter database to bootstrap their Twitter clone”, which Substack’s chief executive has denied in a post on Substack Notes. The spat appears to be distracting Musk from more pressing concerns at the social network. Over the weekend, users reported that the company’s privacy-focused Circles feature was leaking private user data. Similar to Instagram’s Close Friends feature, posts shared to a Twitter Circle are supposed to be shown only to other users who have been explicitly added to that Circle. But multiple users, including security researcher Ian Coldwater, found that other users were able to see their supposedly secret posts. “I made a Twitter Circle with one person in it,” Coldwater said. “Two people I don’t follow saw the tweet &amp; liked it. One of those people doesn’t follow me either. Twitter Circles aren’t private. Don’t post anything you want private in them.” A request for comment to Twitter was unanswered, save for the company’s automatic reply to all press inquiries: a poo emoji. • This article was amended on 12 April 2023 to add a statement from Substack that was provided after publication.",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/11/row-between-twitter-and-substack-ends-with-uneasy-truce
22,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-10,Musk admits BBC ‘among least biased’ in row over Twitter ‘government-funded media’ tag,"Elon Musk has described the BBC as “among the least biased” media organisations after the broadcaster objected to being labelled as “government-funded media” on Twitter. The BBC contacted Twitter after the designation was attached to the main @BBC account. The label links through to a page on Twitter’s help centre that says “state-affiliated media” are outlets where the government “exercises control over editorial content” in various ways. The BBC added in its statement: “The BBC is, and always has been, independent. We are funded by the British public through the licence fee.” Since 1927, the BBC has operated through a Royal Charter agreed with the government that states the corporation “must be independent”, particularly over “editorial and creative decisions, the times and manner in which its output and services are supplied, and in the management of its affairs”. Britons pay a £159 licence fee each year to fund the corporation’s output. The fee is set by government but paid by individual households. Responding to the complaint, Musk asked: “Is the Twitter label accurate?” In an email to the BBC, he wrote: “We are aiming for maximum transparency and accuracy. Linking to ownership and source of funds probably makes sense. “I do think media organisations should be self-aware and not falsely claim the complete absence of bias. All organisations have bias, some obviously much more than others. “I should note that I follow BBC news on Twitter, because I think it is among the least biased.” While the @BBC account concerned, which has 2.2 million followers, has been given the label, more popular accounts affiliated to the broadcaster’s news and sport output, including BBC News (World) and BBC Breaking News, are not being described in the same way. Twitter also designated America’s National Public Radio (NPR) as “state-affiliated media”, a label given to outlets including Russia’s RT and China’s Xinhua News. The description was later changed to the same “government funded media” tag now applied to the @BBC account. NPR – which receives some money from public institutions but whose funding mainly comes from sources such as corporate sponsorships and membership fees – had said it would stop tweeting from the account unless it was amended.

23,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-05,Twitter accused of censorship in India as it blocks Modi critics,"Twitter has been accused of bowing to government pressure in India by blocking scores of prominent journalists, politicians and activists from its platform in recent weeks. The Indian government issued notices to Twitter to remove people in the aftermath of an internet shutdown in Punjab during the search for a fugitive Sikh separatist leader. Twitter agreed to block more than 120 accounts, including the Canadian politician Jagmeet Singh, the Canadian poet Rupi Kaur, several journalists and an Indian MP. Twitter also blocked the handle of the BBC’s Punjabi bureau. Jaskaran Sandhu, the Toronto-based co-founder of Baaz News, an outlet focused on the Sikh diaspora, received an email from Twitter on 21 March that said his account had been withheld in India. In the email, seen by the Guardian, no specific tweet or activity by Sandhu was cited by Twitter for its action. “The Indian government has made it a norm to take draconian measures and crack down on dissent coming from Sikh or other minority communities,” Sandhu said. “Twitter’s actions are just another example [that imply] civil liberties and democratic rights are under attack.” “My entire account, not any tweet, has been banned in India. It is blanket censorship. And there is absolute silence from Twitter on this.” Freedom House, a US-based nonprofit organisation, has accused the prime minister Narendra Modi’s government of “driving India toward authoritarianism” and in 2021 downgraded India’s status from ‘free’ to ‘partly free’. India, the third-largest market for Twitter after the US and Japan, is proving to be one of its biggest challenges. Responding to a tweet about censorship in India, Elon Musk, who completed a takeover of Twitter in October and calls himself a “free speech absolutist”, tweeted: “It is not possible for me to fix every aspect of Twitter worldwide overnight, while still running Tesla and SpaceX, among other things.” Social media platforms including Twitter had been seen as one of the remaining avenues for Indian people to express dissent, after traditional media houses largely caved in to pressure from the government to toe its line. Twitter sued the government in July over takedown orders, after the government introduced legislation in 2021 aimed at regulating every form of digital content, including online news, social media, and streaming platforms and empowering itself to remove content it deemed “objectionable”. Prateek Waghre, the policy director of the Internet Freedom Foundation, said much of the content being withheld was reportage that did not portray the government in a positive light. “There is no contention. It is just absurd,” he added. Since his takeover, Musk has reportedly slashed Twitter’s workforce by 90% in India. “There is a question if Twitter still has people to vet these requests,” Waghre said. “The question is also on the willingness of a pushback, which has certainly reduced [since Musk takeover].” Raqib Hameed Naik, the founder of Hindutva Watch, a US-based site that tracks hate crimes in India, described the situation as “very grim”. “Big tech has completely surrendered to the authoritarian regime of PM Narendra Modi,” he said. “Twitter’s conduct in India sets a worrying trend of silencing media, critics and dissenters worldwide.” Sandhu said he was not optimistic about India’s ability to “uphold minimal requirements for a healthy democracy”, describing the system as “rotten to the core”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/05/twitter-accused-of-censorship-in-india-as-it-blocks-modi-critics-elon-musk
24,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-04,Twitter makes unexplained logo change to Dogecoin cryptocurrency image,"Almost 24 hours after Twitter changed its blue bird logo to a badly cut-out image of a dog meme made famous by cryptocurrencies, the company’s billionaire owner, Elon Musk, has still offered no explanation or justification for the change. On Monday, US time, users noted that the blue bird logo on Twitter’s homepage and loading screen had been replaced with the shiba inu image associated with the Dogecoin memecoin cryptocurrency. For hours, neither Twitter nor Musk even acknowledged the change. Adding to the confusion was an apparently unrelated bug that surfaced at the same time, one of an increasing number in Twitter’s user interface, which removed the ability to tell which tweets had been retweeted on to your timeline. In typical Musk fashion, he eventually tweeted a meme noting the change, and followed up with the closest to an explanation he has proffered: a callback to a joke a follower made in March 2022 suggesting that he should buy Twitter and replace the logo with Doge. The official Dogecoin account tweeted in response: “Very currency. Wow. Much Coin. How Money. So Crypto.” An email requesting comment from Twitter’s press office received only the automatic response, a single poo emoji, that has sufficed for Twitter’s public relations operation since late March. Some users speculated it was meant to be an April fool’s day gag that the company was unable to bring in on time on 1 April. Others wondered if it was an effort to flood out news of a court case against Musk. The change came just days after Musk petitioned a court in the US to dismiss a lawsuit filed against him by Dogecoin investors for $258bn over an alleged pyramid scheme. Reuters reported in June last year that according to the complaint, the plaintiffs claim Musk knew that since 2019 the cryptocurrency had no value, but promoted Dogecoin to profit from its trading. “Musk used his pedestal as world’s richest man to operate and manipulate the Dogecoin Pyramid Scheme for profit, exposure and amusement,” the complaint reportedly stated. The plaintiffs reportedly complained the sell-off of Dogecoin began when Musk appeared on Saturday Night Live and referred to Dogecoin as a “hustle” in a segment. Lawyers for Musk and Tesla have called the lawsuit’s allegations a “fanciful work of fiction” over Musk’s “innocuous and often silly tweets” about Dogecoin. The value of Dogecoin jumped last year after Musk announced Tesla merchandise could be bought using it. On Twitter’s logo changing, Dogecoin’s value jumped from US$0.079 to US$0.094, the highest value the currency has been since November last year. Twitter is now worth less than $20bn, according to a leaked internal memo, under half what Musk paid for it six months ago. Despite promising to remove legacy blue ticks for verified users from 1 April, the site has only so far removed the tick for the New York Times’s main Twitter account.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/04/twitter-changes-logo-to-dogecoin-cryptocurrency-image-in-apparent-late-april-fools-day-gag
25,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-03,Twitter legacy blue ticks remain despite Elon Musk’s subscription threat,"Twitter has so far not followed through on an announcement that it would remove blue ticks from legacy verified users, meaning those users continue to display them alongside paying subscribers. Last month, Twitter’s billionaire owner, Elon Musk, announced that from 1 April, legacy verified users would have their blue ticks removed from the service unless they paid the US$8 a month subscription fee for Twitter Blue. For organisations, the fee is US$1,000 a month. As April fool’s day came and passed, the blue ticks remained, despite much anticipation. As of Sunday, Musk appears to have only removed one blue tick: that for the account of the New York Times. This appears to have been done in retaliation for the news outlet announcing it would not pay for the service, according to a reply from Musk. The New York Times also reportedly told reporters that it would not reimburse their costs for subscribing to Twitter Blue, except where it may be needed for their reporting. The Times had reported that Twitter would keep the verification badge for the 10,000 most followed organisations, which would include the Times with nearly 55m followers. The Washington Post reported on Friday that the removal of legacy verification badges may take a long time because the process may require a lot of manual elements. On Sunday, Twitter also removed the information that differentiated between legacy verified accounts and Twitter Blue subscribers, with users told when clicking the tick that the account is “verified because it’s subscribed to Twitter Blue or is a legacy verified account.” Users that had subscribed to the service had sometimes found themselves ridiculed on the platform for paying for the account, and Twitter was reportedly also mulling an option for subscribers to hide their verified badges. Musk on Sunday said Twitter would also add a verified date to a user’s account, but this would only apply to subscribers. Last week Musk backed down on a plan to only promote verified users through the company’s “For You” timeline that is algorithmically curated, stating other users would be visible as well in that feed. A leaked memo from Musk last week also revealed Twitter is worth less than half what the billionaire paid for it six months ago, down to less than US$20bn.

26,twitter,Guardian,2023-04-01,Catherine Lacey: ‘That constant nervous Twitter energy repels me’,"Catherine Lacey, 37, is the author of three previous novels, including The Answers, currently being adapted for television by Darren Aronofsky, and Pew (2020), about a nameless amnesiac of ambiguous race and gender. Her new novel, Biography of X, set in a parallel America, follows a widow untangling the life story of her wife, an avant-garde artist known as X. The New York Times has called it “sprawling and ambitious… strange and dystopian”. Lacey, one of Granta’s best young American novelists in 2017, was speaking from her home in Brooklyn. Which part of the book came first: the alternate history or the fake biography? I liked the idea of writing a fake biography and the biographies I like best are usually written by someone with some kind of compromised perspective. I thought the worst person to write a biography would be a surviving spouse with a bit of a grudge, but I didn’t want to get into the heterosexual dynamics of a man writing about a woman or a woman writing about a man; it had to be two women. At the same time, I wanted the novel to be set in the mid-20th century but I wasn’t interested in writing about the actual struggles a prominent lesbian couple would have gone through in that time. So my alternate history grew out of that problem. I thought, if I have an America where this female artist could exist and this couple could exist without having to justify themselves, I just need a totally different America. As a workaround, it hardly cut corners. I liked that! I started the novel in 2016 at the same time that I was writing Pew, which takes place in a week and was so spare. I’d decided to make myself write Pew quickly to see what would happen; I found that I can do it, I just prefer not to. Biography of X was more a kind of collecting project that I knew would take longer. Where do the various photographs of X come from? A lot of them I found in junk shops; for the images of her books, I commissioned jackets from a book designer. Why did you include real names from the art and book world? I saw it as another tool to make the novel as much like a biography as possible. There’s a quote [used in the book] from the New Yorker critic Merve Emre that is actually something she wrote about a Susan Sontag biography. There are a lot of names in there. A lot of them I made up. Like the critic “Richard Cusk”. His quote is from Rachel Cusk’s essay on Celia Paul, about being female and making art. It was full of insights related to what I was writing, but by the time I set up the novel’s world I knew the essay would have to be flipped into a man arguing for his right to make art. Why does the story stop short of the 21st century? My fiction has never actively involved cellphones or the internet. It’s too big; I can’t get near it. The internet I’m still on mentally is the more isolated, late 90s internet that was about weird web design and play. It wasn’t that constant nervous Twitter energy, which repels me. I do use cellphones and the internet – I’m not off in a cabin – but they’re a plot killer. Did you have qualms about portraying the American south as a separatist theocracy? It’s an exaggerated nightmare of what could have happened to that part of the country. I didn’t want a cheap shot. I’m southern. I grew up in Mississippi and then in Tennessee and my whole family still lives in Mississippi. I don’t want to be one of those people who dismisses Mississippi as full of ignorant racists, because it’s not. The culture I grew up in is the reason I write. I think for a lot of writers coming out of the south it’s a very complicated place. It’s America magnified: everything problematic about America just made really big. What draws you to characters who find it so hard simply to exist? I think it’s reacting to my very biblical childhood. It’s not a conscious thing: “Oh, I’ll insert a character that refuses identity or has difficulty with a fundamental aspect of their existence.” I think it’s just what happens when you leave a religion. Part of you is always going to ask: “Why? Why any of this?” Not many of the people I grew up with have left the south and most of the ones who go to church take a soft view of their own belief: “Maybe there’s a god, maybe there isn’t; it doesn’t really matter, I just like going to church.” I could never be that way; the minute I didn’t believe, I couldn’t go. Name a (real) biography you admire. Joshua Rivkin’s Chalk: The Art and Erasure of Cy Twombly. While he was writing it the estate decided they didn’t want him to do it and started making his life very difficult. So halfway through the biography his attempt to write the book becomes part of the story. He gets at something of Twombly’s life and work and the way people respond to it. I broke down looking at his last painting at the Twombly museum in Houston. Most Twombly fans – and I’d put myself in this category – have some very extreme response to his work that feels mysterious. What else have you enjoyed reading recently? My Life by Lyn Hejinian: a strange, amazing memoir. Last summer, I was staying with a friend who had it in her house. I picked it up one morning and read it all that day. I used to be very rigid about what I read and when; I used to have a schedule, almost. But I find I’m much happier when I just let books sort of stumble into my life. • Biography of X is published on 6 April by Granta (£18.99).

27,twitter,Guardian,2023-03-31,"Trump loses, Paltrow wins: Twitter marks a historic afternoon for America","An ex-president indicted for alleged hush money payments to a porn star. A wealthy actor and wellness guru vindicated in a nail-biting fight for justice against a retired optometrist. And all in the space of a few hours. The reaction on Twitter was clear: God bless America. Social media was quick to flood with users highlighting the remarkable timing of the verdicts. First came the supposedly untouchable Donald Trump, who was indicted by a New York grand jury over an alleged hush money payment made to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election. Less than two hours later, in a Utah courtroom, a jury sided with Gwyneth Paltrow, finding her not at fault for a ski accident with Terry Sanderson at a posh mountain resort, and awarding her $1 in compensation. Trump, whose other accomplishments include trying to overturn a legitimate election and seeking political counsel from a pillow salesman, will soon be fingerprinted and processed for a felony arrest – marking a first for a US president. Paltrow, a Hollywood nepo baby turned orgasm-candle salesperson, captivated onlookers during a weighty civil suit, which offered a rare glimpse into what it’s like to be absurdly rich. Some Twitter users reacted with pure, unfiltered joy. Others remarked that a better afternoon of legal drama couldn’t have been scripted for television. The timing also led to speculation about how the two celebrities might feel about sharing the spotlight.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/30/twitter-trump-indictment-paltrow-verdict
28,twitter,Guardian,2023-03-29,Twitter to no longer only promote paid-for accounts after backlash,"Twitter has reversed course on plans to limit presence on its “for you” timeline to paying users only, with Elon Musk claiming he “forgot to mention” that other users would be visible as well. When the company’s owner first announced the plan on Tuesday he said it would limit the tab that algorithmically curates tweets for users to only display accounts who had paid £8 a month for “Twitter Blue” and linked their account to a working phone number. Musk said restricting it to those subscribers, who will be the only “verified” users on the site after Twitter closes its “legacy” verification program on Saturday, was “the only realistic way to address advanced AI bot swarms taking over”. The announcement was met with a backlash from many users, however, and later that day Musk said in a second tweet: “Forgot to mention that accounts you follow directly will also be in For You, since you have explicitly asked for them.” Since its launch under Musk, as a rebranded version of the pre-existing “recommended” feed, the for you tab has proved controversial. It is more aggressively curated than its predecessor, regularly inserting tweets from accounts the user does not follow, and has a noted predilection for pushing tweets from a small number of prominent accounts into as many feeds as possible: such as Menswear commentator @dieworkwear, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro and almost every public post from Musk himself. The stated rationale for limiting the for you tab to paid accounts only was to prevent “bot swarms” from dominating it. Musk has been focused on the prominence of automated spam accounts since before he even bought the site, citing spam as one of the key reasons why he wanted to acquire it, and later citing the same spam as one of the reasons he should be allowed to renege on the deal. However, his focus stepped into a higher gear in late December, after he posted a “binding” poll to ask whether he should step down as the head of the company. Within 24 hours, more than 10 million users had voted in favour of him resigning, 57.5% of the overall votes. The following day, Musk broke his silence only to tweet the word “interesting” to several suggestions that the results of the poll were skewed by fake accounts, and to agree with a suggestion that only paid-for accounts should be able to vote in polls. That policy is on track to be introduced on 15 April, Musk said in a tweet on Tuesday. Musk has yet to confirm any plans to step down as head of the company.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/29/twitter-to-no-longer-only-promote-paid-for-accounts-after-backlash-elon-musk
29,twitter,Guardian,2023-03-28,"Twitter to promote only paying users’ tweets, Elon Musk announces","Twitter’s feed will promote only the tweets of users paying its £8 monthly subscription service, Elon Musk, the site’s owner and chief executive, has tweeted. From 15 April, the “For you” tab on the site, which attempts to algorithmically curate popular posts for users, will feature only “verified accounts”, Musk tweeted, describing the decision as “the only realistic way to address advanced AI bot swarms taking over”. Voting in polls on the site will also require verification “for same reason”, Musk added. From 1 April, existing users with verification badges on the site, now known as “legacy verified”, will lose them unless they pay the monthly fee. A “verified account” will need to pay the £8 fee and provide a working phone number. In 2022, Musk proposed requiring users to pay a fee to vote in polls, after a public proposal that he step down as chief executive of the site came to a surprise close with a large majority in favour of him quitting. Although he had initially promised the vote would be binding, in the hours after he began flirting with the idea that a large number of “bot” accounts had skewed the vote. As well as the £8 monthly service for Twitter Blue, organisations have been offered a distinctive form of verification, which gives a yellow tick, with a price tag of $1,000 a month. That allows them to bestow further verification for their employees, for another $10 a month, while linking them back to the company. Not everything is bad for the former Twitter elite, though. According to a report from the Platformer newsletter, Twitter still offers special service to a hand-picked list of 35 VIPs, including Musk himself, who are artificially promoted on the platform’s algorithmic feeds. The list includes a bizarre selection of power users from across American society, including the politicians Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Joe Biden, journalists Ben Shapiro, Matthew Yglesias and Glenn Greenwald, and the poster Dril, who once tweeted (in capitals): “If the zoo bans me for hollering at the animals I will face god and walk backwards into hell.” But the list was not created to boost the accounts, according to the report. Instead, it was assembled to help reassure Musk that algorithmic changes were not affecting his own reach. A cross-section of the platform’s biggest accounts, it helped demonstrate which changes to the ranking system were meaningful, in the process increasing their engagement.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/28/twitter-to-promote-only-paying-users-tweets-elon-musk-announces
30,twitter,Guardian,2023-03-27,Twitter takes legal action after source code leaked online,"Twitter has revealed some of its source code has been released online and the social media platform owned by Elon Musk is taking legal action to identify the leaker. According to a court filing made on Friday, Twitter is demanding that GitHub, a code-sharing service, identifies who released on the platform parts of its source code – the underlying software on which the service operates. GitHub has taken down the leaked code but Twitter has asked a US court to order the Microsoft-owned business to “identify the alleged infringer or infringers who posted Twitter’s source code on systems operated by GitHub without Twitter’s authorisation”. The code was posted online by a GitHub user who used the name FreeSpeechEnthusiast, in an apparent nod to Musk, referring to himself as a “free speech absolutist.” Musk is obsessed with the threat of Twitter being sabotaged by current and former staff, according to the tech newsletter Platformer, after a takeover that led to the immediate firing of half of Twitter’s 7,500 staff and the reinstatement of formerly suspended rightwing accounts including that of Donald Trump. Twitter’s workforce now numbers fewer than 2,000 people. In the court filing, Twitter’s assistant general counsel, Julian Moore, said the request to identify the leaker was being made under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which came into force in 1998. Leaking source code could allow security vulnerabilities, according to one expert. “Leaks of source code like this can allow security vulnerabilities to be identified and may disclose sensitive commercial information,” Steven Murdoch, a professor of security engineering at University College London, said. “However, Twitter’s most valuable resources are its brand, customer base, and the skills of its employees. I would be surprised if this leak has any significant long-term effect on the company.” Twitter’s cybersecurity setup was strongly criticised by a whistleblower before Musk completed his takeover. Twitter’s former head of security, Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, who was fired in January 2022, claimed he had uncovered “extreme, egregious deficiencies by Twitter in every area of his mandate”, including weak controls of employee access to user data and interference by foreign governments. The filing on Friday was made as Musk revealed to employees that the business he bought for $44bn (£36bn) in October is now worth less than half that, according to a memo seen by the New York Times. The memo said Twitter, which has debts of $13bn related to the financing of the takeover, had been four months away from running out of money. The platform, which makes most its revenue from advertising, has been hit by an advertiser boycott after Musk’s acquisition, amid concerns over issues including moderation standards and the impact of job cuts. GitHub has been contacted for comment. A request for comment from Twitter’s press office was met with an automated reply containing a poo emoji, a new policy announced by Musk this month.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/27/twitter-legal-source-code-leaked-elon-musk-github
31,twitter,Guardian,2023-03-26,Elon Musk memo suggests Twitter worth less than half of what he paid for it,"Twitter is worth less than half of what Elon Musk paid for it six months ago having lost more than $20bn (£16.4bn) in value, according to calculations based on a leaked memo from the billionaire. Musk suggested in memo to the social media company’s staff that it is now valued at less than $20bn. This compares with the $44bn he paid for it in October 2022. The company’s steep devaluation follows Musk’s turbulent takeover. Several large advertisers have left the platform and a major source of funds for Musk’s purchase of the company, the investment firm Fidelity, has written down the value of its stake by 56%. The measure of Twitter’s worth was based on Musk’s offer of stock grants, according to Platformer and the Information, which first reported on the memo. Generally used as way to incentivise employees, stock grants are an opportunity to buy shares that cannot be sold until a set point in time, as opposed to stock options, which - depending on the conditions applied - can be more flexible. The aim is to encourage staff to reach a set valuation by a point in time so that they can sell their shares for cash. The stock grants could be “sold every six months, based on a third party valuation”, another separate internal email to Twitter staff said. Musk’s email also said that, before a spate of high-profile, acrimonious layoffs the company had been about four months from running out of money. Twitter’s headcount has been cut from about 7,500 to about 2,000 employees, according to figures Musk put forward in December. In his latest memo, he also told staff: “I see a clear, but difficult, path to a &gt;$250B valuation,” which would imply a tenfold increase in share value. The memo suggests the model would be similar to that which Musk, who also runs Tesla, has adopted at SpaceX, another of his companies, which allows staff to sell shares back to it. This can be a lucrative incentive if the company’s value rises significantly, but it is not as flexible as selling a listed stock.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/26/elon-musk-twitter-value-leaked-memo-less-than-half-paid
32,twitter,Guardian,2023-03-25,Twitter loses bid to throw out complaint by Australian Muslim group over ‘hateful’ content,"Twitter has lost a bid to have a complaint by an advocacy group for Australian Muslims thrown out after they accused the platform of failing to take action against accounts that incite hatred. The Australian Muslim Advocacy Network (Aman) lodged a complaint to the Queensland Human Rights Commission (QHRC) last June. They argued that, as a publisher, Twitter Australia and Twitter Inc are responsible for content posted by a far-right account that has been referred to in the manifesto of a white supremacist and mass murderer. Aman says the platform has repeatedly refused to delete the account or take down replies to its posts which refer to the Qur’an as “the terrorist handbook” and to Islam as “the most violent and sexually perverse cult”. The complaint to the commission contained 419 items, including 29 tweets it claims incited hatred and 390 comments and quotes on those tweets. Aman made the complaint under Queensland’s Anti-Discrimination Act, alleging Twitter incited hatred as a publisher of third-party accounts, as well as discrimination for refusing to take action against hateful content. Twitter hit back at the complaint, arguing it should be dismissed as it was “misconceived” and “lacking in substance”, according to a letter detailing the QHRC’s decision. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The letter, seen by Guardian Australia, argued Twitter Australia was the wrong entity for the complaint as it does not host, operate, or control the Twitter service – which is controlled by Twitter Inc. Twitter Inc argued Queensland’s Anti-Discrimination Act does not apply to it, as the platform is “incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in the United States”. The company also refuted the idea that “any courts or tribunals in Queensland are or can be a ‘court of competent jurisdiction’ in relation to the complaint”. In a decision by the QHRC, a commission officer said they could not agree that the complaint was “misconceived or lacking in substance”. The officer also questioned Twitter’s claims that the state’s legislation does not apply to them, before referring the matter to the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal for a decision on jurisdiction. “A foreign person is not immune from [the] application of Queensland legislation in respect of things that occur in Queensland,” the officer said. “The service is available and operates within Queensland and as such, it is likely to be required [to] comply with Queensland legislation.” The QHRC officer wrote that the matter “remains unresolved” despite the parties participating in a conciliation conference on 11 October. Aman said Twitter’s approach “contradicts” the position put forward by Twitter Inc’s chief executive, Elon Musk, at February’s world government summit in Dubai. “Social media companies should adhere to the laws of countries, and not try to put a thumb on the scale beyond the laws of countries,” Musk said at the summit. “I think that the general idea is to reflect the values of the people as opposed to imposing the values of, essentially San Francisco and Berkley, which are somewhat of a niche ideology as compared to the rest of the world.” Aman says community groups have been forced “to bring one legal action after another to assert their right to live free from discrimination”. “The case will deal with issues of public importance, such as the degree to which social media companies are liable for content published on their platform and whether it is discriminatory for platforms not to uphold local standards,” they said. A QHRC spokesperson said complaints lodged with the commission are “confidential” and they “do not provide any details about any complaint at any stage of proceedings”. They said the commission was “impartial and will not take sides”.

33,twitter,Guardian,2023-03-16,‘The first Twitter-fuelled bank run’: how social media compounded SVB’s collapse,"Shares in banks all over the world have plummeted in recent days as fears that the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) could precipitate a wider crisis in the sector. The speed at which market jitters have spread across the world have forced bank executives and regulators to move with unprecedented swiftness: US authorities guaranteed all deposits in SVB – and smaller bank Signature – 48 hours after it collapsed. Just hours after Credit Suisse’s share price plunged on Wednesday, the Swiss central bank stepped in with a $54bn loan. While there’s nothing new about a financial emergency, these crises – and their resulting responses – are unique in having been accelerated by a frenzy of social media chatter that has fuelled the panic. ‘It was a bank sprint, not a bank run’ A bank run occurs when customers lose faith in an institution’s ability to look after their money, and large numbers withdraw their deposits all at once. As more people withdraw their funds, the likelihood of the bank being able to cover the withdrawals falls, leading more customers to pile in and demand the return of their money. “If you see a bomb disposal expert running down the street, don’t ask them what’s happened, just try to keep up,” writes Daniel Davies, the managing director of Frontline Analysts, in the Financial Times. Rumours around a bank’s solvency can build up for months or years before it leads to a run. Or it can happen in a matter of hours. The collapse of SVB was the second-largest bank failure in the history of the United States. The largest, Washington Mutual in 2008, took place over the course of eight months. SVB’s collapse played out in barely two days. Anxious Twitter posts and WhatsApp exchanges, coupled with the ease of access that online banking provides, are seen by analysts as a serious catalyst for the current crisis. Experts suggest that in the social media age, the psychological behaviour behind a bank run – mass fear from depositors of losing their savings – may be amplified and go viral quicker than bank officers and regulators can successfully respond. Michael Imerman, a professor at the Paul Merage School of Business at the University of California-Irvine, says that what happened to SVB was, “a bank sprint, not a bank run, and social media played a central role in that.” ‘You should be absolutely terrified right now’ What few SVB customers realised a week ago was how vulnerable their bank was. Like all banks, it had invested its customers deposits, with much of the money going into long-dated US government bonds. The problem was that bonds have an inverse relationship with interest rates, so when the Federal Reserve started to hike rates rapidly to combat inflation, the bonds SVB owned started to lose significant value. Many of SVB’s customers were also hurt by interest rate rises and needed to access their deposits to meet day-to-day business expenses. But with the value of their investments squeezed, the bank struggled to meet their customers demands. A decision to raise funds through a sale of shares proved to be the bank’s death knell. Venture Capital firm, Founders Fund, is reported to have told companies in its portfolio to move their money out of SVB. In the gossip-fuelled world of Silicon Valley, this news spread like wildfire. Customers withdrew $40bn – one-fifth of SVB’s deposits – in just a few hours. Mark Tluszcz, CEO of Mangrove Capital, tweeted: “If you are not advising your companies to get the cash out, then you are not doing your job as a board member or as a shareholder.” Investor Bill Ackman tweeted that if federal regulators didn’t quickly step in and guarantee all deposits, runs on other banks would start on Monday. “You should be absolutely terrified right now,” investor Jason Calacanis tweeted, using all capital letters for emphasis. “That is the proper reaction to a bank run and contagion.” Other high-profile entrepreneurs sounded the alarm which spread on social media, resonating loudly with the bank’s customers who tended to be tech-savvy entrepreneurs keenly tuned in to online chatter. Congressman Patrick McHenry, chairman of the US House Financial Services Committee, referred to the turmoil as, “the first Twitter fuelled bank run.” Some messages that caused cold sweats among financial customers proved to be misleading, prompting calls to focus on facts not speculation. “The last several days represent a unique incident fuelled by misinformation on social media and are not indicative of the health of our industry,” said Lindsey Johnson, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, in a statement. The fear spreads SVB might be the first bank run of the social media era, but it wasn’t the first bank to see its fundamental business rocked by feverish Twitter speculation. Early on Thursday, Switzerland’s Credit Suisse announced that it would take a $53.7bn loan from the Swiss central bank to shore up its finances after its share price fell by as much as 30%. The selloff occurred when the bank’s largest shareholder, Saudi National Bank (SNB), ruled out providing it with fresh funding because of restrictions limiting its holding. However, SNB’s chairman said Credit Suisse was “a very strong bank” and was unlikely to need more cash after a major restructuring plan in autumn last year. A cap on how large its stake could be was the reason for not investing further. Credit Suisse’s problems are not new, the bank’s customers have weathered a series of scandals and stock fluctuations over the past decade which have led to an exodus of clients, pulling their cash from the bank, contributing to losses that grew to 7.3bn Swiss francs in 2022. But last October, its shares fell 12% in one day after a journalists tweeted that a “major international investment bank” was on the brink. The tweet was then wrongly paraphrased by investing.com, which tweeted it out to their thousands of followers. The rumour spread like wildfire across online forums and social media accounts, but was, at least then, unfounded. Credit Suisse’s issues were well established by then and its share price had been declining for months, but experts have pointed to the tweet, and its subsequent dissemination, as highly damaging to the bank. Regulators, policymakers and bankers are all now being forced to look at the role that social media may have played in the current upheaval – and work out what they can possibly do to stay ahead of the rumours.

34,twitter,Guardian,2023-03-13,"Robodebt inquiry commissioner criticises mainstream media, praising ‘committed’ coverage on Twitter","The former Queensland supreme court chief justice overseeing the robodebt royal commission has singled out reporters from Guardian Australia and the Saturday Paper and citizen Twitter journalists for their “committed” coverage of the evidence, calling it a “remarkably useful and important public service”, while criticising many other media outlets for their “patchy” coverage. On the final day of hearings into the former Coalition government’s Centrelink income compliance program, just before closing statements, the commissioner, Catherine Holmes SC, took a few minutes to make observations about media coverage of the proceedings. “This commission has to inquire and report, and an important part of the inquiry component is these public hearings because it’s the opportunity to explore evidence in a public forum,” Holmes said. “But not many people have the practical ability, or the time or perhaps the will to sit through day after day of hearings. The interest of what I’ll call the traditional media to distinguish it from social media in these hearings has, with some honourable exceptions, been patchy.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In the five months the royal commission has been holding public hearings, victims of robodebt have described financial and emotional suffering in the face of an opaque and punitive government program that was designed for budget savings rather than social welfare. Media coverage across “traditional” outlets tended “to flare when a minister is on the stand”, Holmes said. The royal commission heard from multiple former Coalition ministers, including former prime ministers Scott Morrison and Malcolm Turnbull, former human services minister Alan Tudge, former government services minister Stuart Robert and former social services minister and attorney general Christian Porter. “As a result, I’ve come to appreciate the importance of social media in this context,” Holmes said. “I’ve been struck by how committed and serious some of the people tweeting are. They provide an almost full-time running summary of evidence with occasional comment. Some of them are people who’ve long been engaged in the robodebt issue. And they both tweet and cross over into mainstream commentary. “I’m thinking of people like [law lecturer] Dr [Darren] O’Donovan, [Saturday Paper journalist] Mr [Rick] Morton and [Guardian Australia social affairs and inequality editor] Mr [Luke] Henriques-Gomes,” Holmes said. “I hasten to say I don’t agree with every privacy or characterisation of the evidence that I’ve seen but I want to acknowledge that the Twitter coverage of these hearings has performed a remarkably useful and important public service in giving people access to the evidence.” The welfare advocate Tom Studans, who posts as @maximumwelfare, tweeted minute-by-minute updates of the commission on every day of inquiry hearings, while another account, @strangerous10, regularly posted video clips of the evidence.

35,twitter,Guardian,2023-03-09,"Afternoon Update: Labor, Greens strike deal in ‘big win for the climate’; Oscar nominees get piece of Queensland; and is Twitter falling apart?","Good afternoon. A major bill is closer to being realised after Labor agreed to Greens’ demands not to use the proposed national reconstruction fund to finance new gas and coal projects or native logging. “Coal and gas are the biggest cause of the climate crisis, so this is a big win for the climate and a big win for jobs and the economy,” the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said. Greens support means the bill is now closer to passing the Senate later this month. If passed, it will establish an off-budget $15bn investment fund that the industry minister, Ed Husic, says is “one of the largest peacetime investments in manufacturing this country has ever seen”. Bandt thanked the government for its “constructive approach” in negotiating the deal, and setting a positive tone between the two parties still trying to break an impasse over Labor’s safeguard mechanism policy. If you want to read more on how those talks could advance, read today’s column from our climate and environment editor, Adam Morton. Top news PM promises ‘absolute sovereignty’ over submarines | Albanese made the remarks amid revelations that the UK had succeeded in its bid to sell Australia British-designed nuclear submarines. Australia will become the seventh country to have a nuclear-powered submarine fleet. That has drawn the ire of China, which has argued Australia’s possession of the nuclear reactors is a breach of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. Oscar goodie bags contain Queensland “scrub” | Oscar nominees are set to receive one square metre of land in outback Australia in their gift bags this year, but environmental organisations have questioned the environmental mission of the company. “Pieces of Australia” is one of a number of brands to pay $4,000 to secure a spot in the hamper which is unaffiliated with the Academy, but sent by the company Distinctive Assets to the acting and directing nominees. But those gifted the land won’t be able to use the “symbolic souvenir”. Home values down 7.9% nationally | … which is the largest slide over a 12-month period on record. Leading the way was Sydney – down 13.4%, then Hobart 11.8% Melbourne 9.6%, Brisbane 6.8% and Canberra 6.7%. Bucking the trend were Adelaide (up 5.1%), Darwin (up 2.9%) and Perth (up 2.4%). Labor, Greens back four-day work week | Senators from the two parties joined forces in recommending a four-day work week trial at full pay and more than double paid parental leave to 52 weeks. Free transport day for Sydney | To make up for yesterday’s peak-hour meltdown of the Sydney train network, the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has ordered a fare-free day be instituted. Perilous migrant path from China to the US | There’s a growing number of would-be Chinese migrants trying to reach the US via a dangerous jungle between Colombia and Panama. Numbers surged last year amid tough Covid lockdowns. “I don’t know much about the US, but at least it’d be better than living in China … We’re like animals. We migrate to a warmer place, instead of staying in a cold place. We don’t want to be frozen to death,” one asylum seeker said. Tucker Carlson ‘passionately hates’ Trump | Or so a text message on 4 January 2021, two days before the Capitol Hill insurrection, said. “I hate him passionately … What he’s good at is destroying things. He’s the undisputed world champion of that. He could easily destroy us if we play it wrong,” the Fox News host wrote. Georgia protests | Thousands are continuing to protest against a proposed law that would create a “foreign agents” register for organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding overseas. The law is similar to a 2012 law in Russia, and has raised concerns it could jeopardise Georgia’s chances of joining the EU. Greece protests | Tens of thousands have staged protest rallies and workers staged a 24-hour general strike as anger over last week’s train disaster intensified. “This is more than a train collision and a tragic railway accident. You get the sense that the country has derailed,” said Nasos Iliopoulos, a spokesperson for Greece’s main leftwing opposition party, Syriza.

Before bed read Twitter has broken down six times this year - most recently on Monday. Experts point to the sacking of thousands of workers, leaving too few engineers to catch and fix problems when they arise. Since Musk completed his US$44bn takeover of Twitter in October last year, the workforce has been reduced from 7,500 employees to about 2,000. “The result is that eventually problems occur which are sufficiently serious to be noticed by large portions of Twitter’s user base,” said Steven Murdoch, a professor of security engineering at University College London.

36,twitter,Guardian,2023-03-08,Rise in Twitter outages since Musk takeover hints at more systemic problems,"On Monday Twitter broke for the sixth time this year. Clicking any link on the social network resulted in an error message, while attempting to post a new image resulted in nothing but a big blank box where the picture should have been. Unlike the last four outages – three in February, and another already in March – the site wasn’t completely unavailable, giving Twitter users the opportunity to engage in their favourite activity: discussing the continued destruction of Twitter live on the site. (The sixth outage this year, in January, only affected Android users.) The trending topics on the site were promptly filled with various phrases relating to the outage, as users speculated that Elon Musk’s own demands had ultimately caused the failure. The error message referred to the Twitter API, a service that allows other programmes to interact with the site. In January, the company had, with no notice, banned third-party apps from using the API, rendering them non-functional overnight. The error message suggested that Twitter had continued tinkering with the feature and accidentally banned its own apps in the process. “A small API change had massive ramifications,” Musk confirmed later that day, calling the code of the site “extremely brittle for no good reason”. Fixing the problems, he added, would “ultimately need a complete rewrite”. Just a single reliability engineer had been allocated to a project to create a paid version of the API, according to a report in the Platformer newsletter, and that engineer pushed a mistaken change to the live version of the site without realising the ramifications. Mistakes happen, and Twitter isn’t alone in being knocked offline by a single engineer: in 2021, Facebook’s services were offline for almost six hours after the company accidentally deleted itself from the “phone book” of the internet. But the regularity of the outages at Twitter, which seems to be getting worse over time, has left some wondering if the occasional errors are adding up to a more systemic problem. Steven Murdoch, a professor of security engineering at University College London, said substantial reductions in Twitter’s engineering team meant fewer people to monitor systems and catch minor problems before they become bigger. “The result is that eventually problems occur which are sufficiently serious to be noticed by large portions of Twitter’s user base,” he said. “It has been suggested that rewriting the Twitter code could help avoid such problems but this is a high-risk strategy. It would result in splitting the already-reduced engineering team between maintaining the old code and making the new version.” Pushing for such a rewrite has already been the cause of Musk’s downfall once before. In the early 00s, after his company, X.com, had merged with the creators of PayPal, Musk as chief executive led a project to merge the back-ends of the two companies, which had been built on incompatible systems. The rewrite spiralled into “a holy war”, according to a 2007 profile of his time at PayPal, and just six months after the merger, Musk was fired as chief executive while on honeymoon. At Twitter, a rewrite will also have to compete with other demands on the company’s time. On Tuesday, the Financial Times reported that the EU had demanded Musk hire more moderation experts in order to comply with the bloc’s new regime for regulating social media platforms, while the US Federal Trade Commission is investigating the company amid concerns that Twitter’s ability to protect users might have been affected by redundancies. Since Musk completed the $44bn (£37bn) takeover of Twitter in October last year, the workforce has been reduced from 7,500 employees to about 2,000. On Tuesday, Musk apologised to a Twitter worker after becoming engaged in a spat with him over whether he still worked at the company or not. The exchange included Musk referring to Haraldur Thorleifsson’s disability as an “excuse” for his performance at work. Musk, who later apologised to Thorleifsson over a “misunderstanding” that led to his tweets, said Thorleifsson was now considering staying at the company. Cost-cutting measures under which Twitter has stopped paying bills for office space, janitorial supplies and even web hosting are starting to meet pushback. The company stepped back from a bruising confrontation with Amazon Web Services as it tried to negotiate a discount on its cloud computing, according to the news site The Information, while a similar standoff with Salesforce saw its Slack communications platform disabled entirely over one weekend in February, leaving staffers unable to collaborate. Twitter’s engineering problems are taking place against a backdrop of financial pressure against the company, which took on $13bn of debt as part of Musk’s funding package for the takeover. That debt requires quarterly interest payments of about $300m. Musk made the first payment in January but analysts have warned that the business, which was loss-making for the majority of its existence before the takeover, must stage a turnaround in order to make those payments consistently. The Tesla boss said this week that Twitter had a “shot” at being cashflow positive in the next financial quarter, referring to one of the financial metrics that can be used to indicate whether a company can meet its debt payments. But at what cost? Twitter has a “shot” at being financially sustainable due to cuts that appear to be affecting the reliability of the site as well as alarming regulators. According to Twitter’s last set of quarterly results as a listed company, published in 2022, Twitter generated negative free cashflow (spending more cash to run the business than it takes in) of nearly $124m. Musk also reiterated his plans to introduce payments on Twitter, and said he envisions users could eventually send money to each other with one click. “I think it’s possible to become the biggest financial institution in the world,” he said. However, advertising is Twitter’s largest source of revenue, accounting for the majority of its $5.1bn turnover in 2021, and Musk admitted soon after the $44bn takeover in October last year that there had been a “massive” drop in advertising revenue. In January it was reported that Twitter’s daily revenue was down 40% compared with the previous year. Farhad Divecha, the managing director of UK digital marketing agency Accuracast, said: “Trust is a big factor right now, and these outages do not instil a lot of confidence in Twitter’s ability to service our clients to the level where we or the brands we represent feel comfortable putting money in the service.” Site breakages add another complication to Musk’s drive to put Twitter on a sustainable footing.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/08/spike-in-twitter-outages-since-musk-takeover-hint-at-more-systemic-problems
37,twitter,Guardian,2023-03-07,ABC accuses News Corp and Daily Mail of amplifying misogynist Twitter abuse of Lisa Millar,"The ABC has accused News Corp and the Daily Mail of amplifying misogynist social media abuse by publishing articles that included “vile” Twitter criticism of an outfit worn by News Breakfast host Lisa Millar. Millar was subjected to trolling for the skirt she wore on Monday’s show, leading to two news stories that included screenshots and abusive tweets, first in the Daily Mail and then in news.com.au on Tuesday. The former foreign correspondent turned breakfast host abandoned Twitter in 2021 after a torrent of abuse about everything from her interview style to whether she smiles, but it has not stopped the critics. “Giving anonymous social media bullies publicity on a national platform is participating in perpetuating antisocial behaviour and the very serious issue of online abuse of women,” an ABC statement said. “Especially on the eve of International Women’s Day, we ask for a more responsible approach to reporting on these issues.” The ABC’s director of news, Justin Stevens, said republishing sexist abuse of a high-profile woman is unacceptable. “Media outlets that amplify this disgusting anonymous trolling need to take a good hard look at themselves and their standards,” Stevens said. “The relentless and vile bullying Lisa Millar is subjected to on social media, particularly Twitter, is unacceptable. She is an outstanding broadcaster and journalist and does an incredible job.” Guardian Australia understands Stevens also appealed directly to News Corp’s corporate affairs chief, Campbell Reid, to reconsider publishing stories like that. Some of the more offensive tweets have been removed from the story since the ABC complained. Millar has responded in an Instagram post that the coverage on the eve of International Women’s Day “perpetuates abuse and proves to all of us how far we still have to go”. “I would prefer to be thinking about the amazing contribution women around the world make, whether it be in their private or professional lives,” she said. The ABC was approached for comment by a news.com.au journalist at 6.42am, but the broadcaster said it was not going to dignify any “vile comments” being made about a presenter’s clothes by responding to them. “If news.com.au was genuine in its concern about such behaviour, it wouldn’t amplify it by republishing the comments it describes as ‘sickening’, accompanied by a screenshot,” the spokesperson said. The news.com.au story was positioned as critical of the trolls and headlined “‘Just plain gutless’: Aussie Twitter users slam online trolls for sickening Lisa Millar comments”. The story ended with: “Millar returned to the set on Tuesday morning alongside co-host Michael Rowland wearing a green long-sleeve blouse and black slacks.” The ABC said it regularly receives queries concerning abusive comments “under the guise of concern” but that these stories “are republishing abuse”. The news.com.au journalist asked the ABC: “I just wanted to check in to see how Lisa was doing and to see if she or the ABC wanted to comment on the behaviour of the trolls online for a story? “If so, can you please provide a statement regarding how Lisa is doing, what ABC’s reaction is towards people making these inappropriate comments online, how the ABC plans to take action, if any, against those making inappropriate comments and what the ABC will do to ensure comments like this are regulated or prevented in the future.” News Corp and the Daily Mail have been approached for comment.",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/mar/07/lisa-millar-news-breakfast-abc-accuses-news-corp-daily-mail-amplifying-misogynist-twitter-trolls-abuse-tv-host-outfit
38,twitter,Guardian,2023-03-01,Twitter down for more than an hour around world,"Twitter was unavailable for users around the world for over an hour on Wednesday morning, the latest in a spate of technical difficulties suffered by the site since its takeover by Elon Musk. Beginning at about 10:20am UK time, visitors to Twitter.com were greeted with error messages. Although the total outage was rapidly fixed, the site remained in effect nonfunctional until well into the afternoon, with users unable to access their “home” feed, despite notifications, profile visits and direct messages still working. Unusually, users could still post to the site throughout the outage, and the “trending topics” continued to refresh, leading to trends including “#TwitterDown“, “My Twitter” and “Welcome to Twitter”. The “For You” feed, which presents an algorithmic collection of the top tweets across the site, was restored before the home feed. Since taking over the business in November, new owner and chief executive Elon Musk has launched at least eight waves of punishing layoffs, reducing the headcount from 7,500 before he started to fewer than 2,000 people. Reports from inside the business have described “critical” teams being laid off in their entirety, with hurriedly promoted replacements struggling to pick up where their departed colleagues left off. For the remaining staff, communication has also been hampered by other cost-cutting decisions. Twitter has stopped paying rent in locations around the world, reversing Musk’s initial push to force all staff to return to the office, while an unannounced reorganisation of its internal communication platform, Slack, saw employees cut off entirely for more than a day, until access was restored with more than 80,000 pre-existing channels archived. In November, after the second wave of layoffs – prompted by Musk’s demand that workers sign a pledge to an “extremely hardcore” mode of working – the chief executive reassured onlookers that Twitter would not shut down because of the lack of staff, saying “the best people are staying, so I’m not super worried”. Despite that, outages at the site have become an increasingly common occurrence. According to NetBlocks, Wednesday’s outage is Twitter’s fifth this year, already putting the platform over halfway towards topping its 2022 total.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/01/twitter-down-for-more-than-an-hour-around-world
39,twitter,Guardian,2023-02-27,"Elon Musk fires additional 200 people at Twitter, report says","Elon Musk has fired another 200 staff at Twitter including the executive behind the revamp of its paid-for premium service, according to a report. The latest round of job cuts equates to about 10% of Twitter’s vastly reduced workforce, which stood at 7,500 people before Musk bought the company in October. According to the New York Times, Twitter sacked at least 200 employees from its 2,000-strong workforce on Saturday. The redundancies affected jobs including product managers, data scientists and engineers who ensure the site runs efficiently, the NYT reported. Esther Crawford, the director of product management at Twitter who oversaw the introduction of charging for account verification, was reportedly among the employees affected. Musk’s hard-driving approach to management was exemplified in November by a picture of Crawford sleeping on the floor of Twitter’s offices, which she retweeted with the hashtag #SleepWhereYouWork. Crawford, tweeted on Sunday that she was “deeply proud” of her team, as she criticised people who had jeered or mocked her achievements, although she did not confirm her departure directly. Twitter’s premium subscription service had a troubled relaunch in November after some users took advantage of paying for a verified account by launching a slew of impersonator accounts. Nintendo, the pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly and the US politician Ted Cruz were among the firms and public figures who found themselves being impersonated by accounts with blue ticks. Twitter Blue was relaunched again in December and, according to news site the Information, has 180,000 subscribers in the US compared with a global monthly user base of more than 250 million people. Musk has identified growth in subscription revenue as a key target for Twitter, which relied on advertising for the majority of its income prior to his takeover but has suffered a plunge in ad revenue because of issues including the impersonation problem. The job losses have taken place against a backdrop of financial uncertainty at Twitter, a company that has been loss-making historically and has struggled to generate the cash flow required to pay off the significant debts it inherited after Musk’s $44bn (£36.7bn) takeover. The deal’s financing included $13bn worth of debt that now sits on Twitter’s balance sheet and costs more than $1bn a year to service. Twitter made the first quarterly payment on that debt in January, but analysts have warned that Musk needs to turn round the business in order to make the debt sustainable in the long term. Musk sacked half of Twitter’s workforce, about 3,750 people, within days of taking over the business and hundreds more left weeks later after the Tesla CEO demanded that staff commit to being “hardcore” or leave. Musk said in December that his cost-cutting drive meant Twitter was is “not on the fast lane to bankruptcy any more” but he has continued to take action on costs in 2023. Twitter has been contacted for comment.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/27/elon-musk-fires-additional-200-people-at-twitter-report-says
40,twitter,Guardian,2023-02-21,BBC removes false Will Ferrell story based on parody Twitter account,"The BBC has removed a story about Will Ferrell apologising to Sunderland football fans, after being fooled by a parody Twitter account with a paid-for blue tick. Ferrell, who has been touring Britain attending football matches over the past month, recorded a video before Sunderland played his team, Queens Park Rangers, in which he mocked “the tears of sorrow” his opponents were going to experience. After the match – which Sunderland won 3-0 – a Twitter account named “Will Ferrell” tweeted a screenshot of a headline about Sunderland fans hitting back, and said “Haway man, sorry”. Readers who tapped on the account (@OfficialWilllF, with three “l”s) would see it had a blue “verified” tick. But only if they tapped on the tick itself would they be told that the account “is verified because it’s subscribed to Twitter Blue”, Twitter’s paid-for subscription. The account’s bio reads “Comedian, actor, impressionist (parody)” and has fewer than 40,000 followers. “In a BBC News Online article, we incorrectly stated QPR fan and actor Will Ferrell apologised for mocking Sunderland fans,” the broadcaster said in a statement. “A quote was taken from a verified Twitter account, but it was not made by the actor. We have removed the article in its entirety since it was based wholly on the apology.” Twitter’s move to replace its “legacy” verification, which required accounts to prove they were who they said they were, with paid-for Twitter Blue, has led to a rash of impersonation incidents. On the weekend the service was launched, a number of accounts paid for the new verification tick after changing their names to major companies or advertisers. One prankster registered and verified the handle of pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly before tweeting that insulin would be free – an announcement that had an immediate impact on the company’s stock price. Elon Musk, the site’s owner and chief executive, was also the target of a number of impersonation incidents, until the verification programme was briefly suspended. When it was resumed, Musk said it had safeguards against impersonation, but in January the Washington Post successfully registered and verified a fake account claiming to be the US senator Ed Markey. Despite the issues at Twitter, Meta announced on Monday it would be following the company’s lead and offering paid-for verification for users of Facebook and Instagram. The service will differ from Twitter Blue in some ways, however, with a higher cost – starting at $11.99 – and a requirement that users submit proof of identity before they are awarded the verified label.",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/feb/21/bbc-removes-false-will-ferrell-story-based-on-parody-twitter-account
41,twitter,Guardian,2023-02-21,"‘Football Twitter’ is a nightmare of abuse and attention-seeking, so I walked away | Sachin Nakrani","A few years ago, Charlie Brooker – creator of the brilliant Black Mirror and a former Guardian columnist – hosted a show for Channel 4 that counted down the greatest video games of all time. A sucker for those sorts of things, not to mention a bit of a gamer in my youth, I tuned in with great interest. There they were: Super Mario Bros, Street Fighter II, Call of Duty … on it went until it was time for Brooker to reveal the No 1. “What could it be?” I wondered. I was not ready for the answer, because the answer was Twitter. A baffling choice and I can’t remember Brooker’s logic for why Twitter was best of the lot. But I do remember his argument for why it was definitely a game, which was that, ultimately, the aim of people who use it is to collect as many followers as possible. Nobody wins Twitter, but everyone plays it, trying their hardest to be among the most popular, influential, important people on there. It’s something that stuck with me and turned over in my head whenever I logged into my account. What is the point of this? What am I trying to achieve? Am I, as Brooker suggested, desperately seeking attention? The answer I came to is yes, I am, so I decided to log out once and for all. Yes, that’s right, I’m off Twitter. Sober for a little under three months and loving it. I left during the World Cup and because of the World Cup, having decided to disengage as much as possible with a tournament whose very existence led to sick forming in my mouth. But it had been a long time coming and fundamentally for what we can at this stage call Brooker’s Law; that every tweet, to varying degrees, is a cry to be noticed. A big opinion. Look at me. A hot take. Look at me. A six-part thread. Look at me. An eight-part rant. Look at me. This job I’ve got, this award I’ve won, this photo of my cute daughter on the swings, this photo of my cute dog on Whitby beach. Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me. On it goes, as relentless as it is nauseating. I was just as bad, what with my wry quips, silly puns and pictures of beer and bridges from trips to watch Liverpool play in Europe, all with the aim of chasing those likes and retweets. I knew what I was doing and kept on doing it until, finally, I stopped. On a Thursday. In late November. Attention is a human craving, one that’s incredibly addictive, which is why social media thrives. It can be hard to kick the habit and that is why I knew I had to go cold turkey in regards to the only platform I was on. No half measures such as deleting the app from my phone and pretending I wouldn’t just log on via Google. No, the account had to be deactivated. Get out quickly and emphatically. My sense is few of my followers noticed what I did, which pretty much summed up my time on Twitter, too. But that’s fine because my decision to quit Twitter was based on factors beyond a need for recognition. More broadly, its descent into hell under Elon Musk – or as the comedian John Oliver described him: “A man who answers the question: ‘What if Willy Wonka benefited from apartheid?’” – and because of my increasing unease with being part of “Football Twitter”. It’s been a nightmare of noise for some time, exhibiting the racism, sexism and homophobia you get on other parts of the site, while also providing its own uniquely tribal flavour, which can be stupidly childish as well as searingly nasty, seen starkly in the abuse those who lost loved ones at Hillsborough are subjected to. Then there’s the increasingly tiresome scourge of whataboutery. Has football discourse always been this way and the difference now is we can see it laid out in front of us, 280 characters at a time? Or have things changed as a consequence of the polarised times we live in? It’s probably a bit of both and sadly there is little sign of things becoming nicer, kinder, any time soon. You can mute and block as much as you want, but such are Twitter’s algorithms and the way things are shared, some of the sewage will always wash up on your shore. I’ve walked away from Twitter before, including 11 years ago when I received abuse from a gang of trolls so vicious it led to me getting the police involved, but this time really does feel like for keeps. I’m not missing it in the slightest and the impact on my job has been minimal – turns out it is possible to be a sports journalist without reading and writing tweets. More importantly, the benefit to my mental health is clear. It’s not that it’s necessarily improved – life ensures my state of mind is always a bit crap – but no more timeline-scrolling has undeniably meant it not getting notably worse. Concerns over his mental health is why fellow Liverpool-supporting football writer Henry Jackson has also given consideration to coming off Twitter. “It has become a far nastier place,” he says. “People are so opinionated that they can never be wrong and it all feels so tribal, not just between rival fans, but among those of the same team. Start tweeting about Jordan Henderson or Naby Keïta to lots of Liverpool-focused accounts, for instance, and all hell will let loose. “It can be damaging to be on Twitter, especially when you’re sensitive and take criticism to heart like I do,” he says. “There’s enough negativity in the world without social media adding to it.” As Jackson stresses, there are positives to Twitter, in his case being somewhere he can plug articles and “allow my personality to shine through”. That’s also the case for others and it’s where I made friends and came across important and stimulating journalism, as well as important and stimulating debates. Then there was the fun stuff, such as podcast recommendations and Josh Pugh sketches. For many, the sense of community is also important, which in relation to “Football Twitter’” means people connecting with a sport that can otherwise feel unwelcoming to them, for various reasons. So good luck to the good folk who continue to use Twitter. I wish you well. But for now and the foreseeable future, I’m done. No more attention-seeking and abuse. Account deactivated. Game over. • This article was amended on 22 February 2023 to remove reference to some games that were not included in Charlie Brooker’s top 25 games mentioned in his programme How Videogames Changed the World.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/21/football-twitter-abuse-attention-seeking-walked-away
42,twitter,Guardian,2023-02-21,Twitter is ending free SMS two-factor authentication. So what can you use instead?,"On the weekend, Twitter announced that from 20 March, people who haven’t subscribed to Twitter Blue will have two-factor authentication via SMS disabled. Twitter has recommended people use third-party apps or a security key instead, but for the overwhelming majority (74.4%) of the 2.6% of active Twitter users who use SMS as their method of authentication, it will mean they have a month to switch or potentially lose protection. So what is two-factor authentication and what should you do to secure your social media account? What is two-factor authentication? Two-factor authentication (2fa) is a second step once you have logged into an online account with a password to prove you are who you say you are. It is an extra layer of security so if your password is compromised, it will be slightly harder for someone to access your account. For authenticator apps and SMS two-factor authentication, you are sent or provided with a number or numbers for you to enter back into the website. Most online services like social media platforms, banks and ones used in workplaces now either require or strongly recommend people use 2fa on their accounts. Why is Twitter switching away from SMS-based 2fa? Twitter claims that SMS 2fa has been “used and abused by bad actors”. The company’s owner, Elon Musk, claims this abuse is costing Twitter about US$60m a year. While the company is correct that SMS-based authentication is not the best, it is not widely considered to be a money-making venture for those who misuse it. Why are other apps better than SMS for authentication? Although no method is foolproof, SMS is much easier to compromise. People can use what is called sim-jacking or sim-swapping to take over your mobile number which can then be used to access your account. This is done by convincing or forcing a telecommunications company to port your mobile number over to a new sim card. Some countries, including Australia, have introduced rules requiring telecommunications companies to properly verify who someone is before allowing them to port a mobile number to a new provider. If I want a second layer of security on my Twitter account, what other options do I have? One option is using a third-party authenticator for 2fa, rather than Twitter’s own service. Google Authenticator is the most prominent third-party app used for 2fa. However, password manager apps, including the one built into Apple’s iOS, now offer to also act as authenticators for Twitter and other sites. When you set up 2fa via the Twitter app on your mobile , it will prompt where you can authenticate. Another option is using a security key, which is a USB drive you can insert into your computer that can be used to authenticate yourself when logging into websites. While most are USB-C or USB based, some can connect wirelessly or through Apple’s lightning port. It a hardware option if you prefer not to use an authenticator app. What should I switch to? Use whatever you feel most comfortable with. If you’re already using a password manager and that app also offers 2fa, then it makes sense to keep using what you know. Whatever you are using, just make sure you’re entering in the number into the correct site and never give out the number to someone on the phone. Although the window for the code to be valid is short, if someone is trying to discover your code and take over your account, they might still be able to if they work quickly enough.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/21/twitter-is-ending-free-sms-two-factor-authentication-so-what-can-you-use-instead
43,twitter,Guardian,2023-02-20,Facebook and Instagram to get paid verification as Twitter charges for two-factor SMS authentication,"Facebook and Instagram users will soon need to pay to be verified on the social media platforms, as Meta follows in the footsteps of rival platform Twitter. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, announced in a Facebook post on Sunday that the service would first roll out in Australia and New Zealand later this week. The company said it would cost US$11.99 a month on web or US$14.99 on iOS and Android (or, in Australia, $19.99 on web or $24.99 on iOS and Android). Zuckerberg said in addition to a blue badge the service would offer “extra impersonation protection”, improved reach for verified users and direct access to customer support. In a blog post, Meta said it would rely on government ID documents to prove the identity of verified accounts, to avoid the embarrassment of accounts impersonating people and brands – as happened when Twitter initially rolled out its paid verification service. Accounts must also have a posting history and users must be at least 18 years old. The service would not be available to businesses at this stage, Meta said. The increased visibility of posts from verified users would “depend on a subscriber’s existing audience size and the topic of their posts”, the company said. Those with smaller audiences might see more of an impact. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The company said it would also offer “exclusive stickers” on Facebook and Instagram stories and Facebook reels. Meta cut 11,000 staff in November – the equivalent of 13% of its workforce – amid falling ad revenue and economic downturn. The company’s share price fell by more than 70% in 2022 before a rebound and in July it reported its first ever fall in revenue. Twitter’s CEO, Elon Musk, responded to the news in a tweet saying it was “inevitable” Meta would follow Twitter. Twitter restricts SMS two-factor authentication to paid accounts Separately, Twitter announced on Friday it would provide SMS-based two-factor authentication only to users who are subscribed to the US$8-a-month ($11.65) Twitter Blue service from 20 March. The company currently provides free two-factor authentication through third-party apps and a security key, which are considered more secure than SMS-based systems. If non-subscriber accounts that use SMS authentication do not switch before the deadline, Twitter said it would disable two-factor authentication for that account. The move has sparked concerns that it could lead to widespread hacks on accounts next month if they fail to switch over. Twitter’s last transparency report prior to Musk’s takeover shows that as of December 2021, although just 2.6% of active Twitter accounts use two-factor authentication, 74.4% of those use SMS as their method of authentication. Musk has claimed Twitter was being “scammed” US$60m a year from fake two-factor authentication messages. He separately supported a tweet claiming the scams were being run by telecommunications companies that had set up bot accounts to run the two-factor authentication process to get revenue from the text messages from Twitter.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/20/facebook-instagram-paid-meta-verification-twitter-charge-2fa-two-factor-authentication-via-sms
44,twitter,Guardian,2023-02-18,Elon Musk has put every lost young man on Twitter in the crosshairs of the far right | Katherine Denkinson,"At the end of last year, the British far-right group Patriotic Alternative (PA) was allowed back on Twitter after a ban of nearly two years for an unknown transgression. Far-right groups immediately urged Elon Musk to “be a hero” and also reinstate the account of the group’s leader, Mark Collett. Three weeks later, they rejoiced as Collett’s account was returned. The reinstatements appear to be part of Musk’s commitment to free speech. But if he knew anything at all about PA, he would realise that he has placed a target on the back of every disenfranchised and politically lost young man on Twitter, many of whom are recruited to the far right via the platform. Consider the cases of two young men who recently began lengthy prison sentences for far-right terrorism offences. Daniel Harris, 19, is a far-right extremist now serving 11 years for creating videos that inspired mass shooters in the US. Luca Benincasa, 20, who recently started a nine-year sentence, was a member of the proscribed neo-Nazi group Feuerkrieg Division. Both men should be held to account for their behaviour, but their actions did not happen in a vacuum. They did not hatch from a swastika-stamped egg at 17 years old, determined to wreak havoc on the world. Their actions, and the beliefs that drove them, are the end product of years of indoctrination by online extremists. Before becoming a journalist, I worked with young men like Harris and Benincasa and have spent a considerable part of my career since then tracking the far right online. I’ve seen first-hand how easily they fall for the rhetoric of extremist and fascist groups and can say, without hyperbole, that the longer groups such as PA are on Twitter, the more dangerous they will become. Unlike the English Defence League and others content to down some beers and scream at the dinghies in Dover, PA and their ilk are tech-savvy PR machines; they know that optics matter and they’re familiar enough with online culture to blend in with more acceptable rightwing groups when they need to. This is apparent in their tweets, promoting community-friendly litter picks and sharing pictures of cute red squirrels. Their online recruitment began on gaming platforms, where PA has a history of coercing boys into the far right, appearing first on Discord then later on the live chat feature in Call of Duty. (Both sites are aware of far-right organising on their platforms, and have committed to action, including banning accounts.) Far-right groups recognise, as the alleged human trafficker Andrew Tate did, that young men disillusioned with the current state of politics often need a strong voice to guide them, and have set out to make themselves the strongest voice in the room. Beyond online gaming communities, fringe groups have been targeted as well. This was clear towards the end of the pandemic, when groups including PA had infiltrated anti-vax conspiracy circles so thoroughly that the latter became convinced that Drag Queen Story Hour was a front for paedophile acceptance. Ostensibly supporting their anti-vax and anti-lockdown views, a post by Collett on his blog suggested his true intentions. Complaining that “any conspiracy theory … or half-baked idea, is taken with the utmost seriousness … [but one of the] forbidden subjects is that of the great replacement”, he revealed that his main goal was to push these collectives further to the right. Like the young men who get sucked in by “incel” groups, those who are susceptible to far-right influence are often lonely, isolated and unsure of how to connect with other people. They may have difficult home lives, or have been bullied and ostracised at school. Retreating into an online world, they find others in a similar situation. Their feelings are validated, their beliefs shared and their confidence that it’s the rest of the world who are “wrong” gets a boost. Playing on those insecurities, nationalist groups quickly begin confirming these young men’s worst beliefs; they can’t get a job because the government’s gone “woke”; the girls who won’t look twice at them are evil feminists out to emasculate western men; and the immigrants they’re intimidated by are the real Big Bad, here to steal their lives, jobs and country. Scary stuff for a teenager, but luckily the far right offers a comforting solution. Join us and be protected. Join us and be part of something. Join us and be somebody. This lasts until the combination of adolescent energy and zealotry turns tragic, and they are discarded. It is telling that none of the prominent online far-right groups have commented on the cases of Harris or Benincasa. So what can we do to protect young men from their influence? For the two who have just bartered their twenties for far-right approval, all we can do is hope they get the much-needed support that it will take to improve their lives. We owe it to those just starting out on their political journeys, however, to remove the harmful influence of PA et al from Twitter. By separating the far right from their intended prey, we enable reasoned discourse and the chance to explore the disillusionment of men such as those above, free from the influence of those with ulterior motives. A win for fascism is not a win for anyone else. Even “free-speech absolutists” with billions of dollars.

45,twitter,Guardian,2023-02-16,"Twitter data appears to support claims new algorithm inflated reach of Elon Musk’s tweets, Australian researcher says ","Data collected by an Australian researcher via Twitter’s API appears to support media claims that the reach of the tweets of the platform’s billionaire owner Elon Musk have been artificially inflated. On Wednesday, the tech news site Platformer reported 80 Twitter engineers had been engaged to tweak the platform’s algorithm after Musk noticed a tweet from the US president, Joe Biden, about the Super Bowl outperformed his own, despite Musk having more than three times the number of followers. The report claimed engineers deployed a new algorithm to artificially inflate Musk’s tweets by a factor of 1,000, ensuring that more than 90% of Musk’s 128.9 million followers would see them. The change reportedly also ensured users who don’t personally follow Musk would see his tweets in their “for you” tab. Dr Timothy Graham, a senior lecturer in digital media at the Queensland University of Technology, said data he extracted from Twitter using its application program interface appeared to support much of this reporting. “It doesn’t bear out that kind of order of magnitude, but definitely something happened,” he said. “[On] the night when Elon Musk reportedly asked his engineers to do stuff … lo and behold, the next morning [there’s] this massive increase in his impressions, and then that’s sustained ever since.” The graphs show that in the hours when the algorithm change was reported to have occurred, Musk’s impressions went up 737%, and his daily impressions have close to tripled. Shortly after Graham tweeted out the graphs charting his findings, he said his Twitter account was briefly locked and then the tweets in question were removed without explanation. The tweets were reinstated a couple of hours after they were first posted. It’s not clear whether the removal of the tweets was related to their content or an ongoing issue with the platform, which has suffered a number of technical issues since Musk’s takeover late last year. Last week users were unable to tweet for nearly an hour, being told they’d hit their daily limit. Graham, who typically researches bot behaviour and other trends on social media, says he was able to track Musk’s tweet data via access to Twitter’s API, which he can currently access for free. Twitter has announced it will cut off free access to this service – including for researchers. Instead it will charge a minimum US$100 a month for access. “The Twitter API may shut down any moment – if this is the last data I ever collect it’ll totally be worth it,” Graham tweeted on Thursday. Graham said many of the features he currently uses for his research will also be cut off as part of the changes – even if he pays. “It looks like they’re going to be severely downscaling what you can get out of it, so it’s kind of grim at the moment.” He said, depending on what the final implementation looks like, he may have to turn to other platforms or methods to track social media activity. Twitter no longer has a communications department. The Guardian sent questions to the email address formerly used by the company to field press enquiries.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/16/twitter-data-appears-to-support-claims-new-algorithm-inflated-reach-of-elon-musks-tweets-australian-researcher-says
46,twitter,Guardian,2023-02-15,Elon Musk reportedly forced Twitter algorithm to boost his tweets after Super Bowl flop,"Twitter chief executive Elon Musk rallied a team of roughly 80 engineers to reconfigure the platform’s algorithm so his tweets would be more widely viewed, tech news site Platformer has reported. A disgruntled Musk called for an emergency effort after a tweet he sent during Sunday’s Super Bowl game failed to achieve as much engagement as a tweet from Joe Biden, interviews and internal documents reviewed by Platformer have revealed. The effort was sparked when a tweet from the president, who has 37m followers, generated nearly 29m impressions while a similar tweet from Musk – who has 128m followers – generated little more than 9.1m impressions. A Twitter employee and cousin of Elon Musk, James Musk, posted urgently in the company Slack at 2.30am the following Monday morning, asking all employees who can code to participate. “Any people who can make dashboards and write software please can you help solve this problem,” he wrote. “This is high urgency.” Engineers then deployed a new algorithm that artificially inflated Musk’s tweets by a factor of 1,000, ensuring that more than 90% of Musk’s 128.9m followers see them. Many who do not follow Musk are also being served his tweets in their feed through the “For you” tab of the app’s home page, which curates tweets from a number of accounts, including those a user is not following. Musk seemed to publicly confirm the move, in his own way, posting a meme about forcing followers to read his tweets. He also told followers to “stay tuned” while Twitter makes adjustments to the algorithm. The decision to devote internal resources to promoting his own tweets comes amid ongoing reports about Musk’s obsession with his own impressions on the platform. Last week, a report from Platformer also revealed Musk had fired a principal engineer at Twitter who told him views on his tweets had decreased organically, with interest in the erratic CEO waning. Users have complained since Twitter made its “For you” page the default feed on the platform in January that Musk’s tweets were appearing more frequently. Musk, who purchased Twitter in October 2022 for $44bn, has made a number of additional changes to the platform in the intervening months, allowing the return of previously banned accounts like that of Donald Trump, changing the process for Twitter verification, and revoking free access to the platform’s API, or application programming interface. Amid ongoing criticisms of his decisions as chief executive, Musk has promised to step down and find a replacement as soon as later this year. Current employees have described a harrowing environment at the company, which laid off nearly half its workforce in November 2022. At the time, Musk defended the cuts and other cost-cutting measures, stating the company was losing $4m per day.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/15/elon-musk-changes-twitter-algorithm-super-bowl-slump-report
47,twitter,Guardian,2023-02-09,Twitter users told they’ve hit daily post limit in latest outage since Musk takeover,"Twitter users were unable to post instantly on the website for almost an hour, in the latest outage to hit the social media platform since billionaire Elon Musk’s $44bn takeover. From around 10pm GMT on Wednesday, users attempting to tweet were informed by the platform they had hit their daily limit – despite many of them reporting having not tweeted at all that day. The outage affected not just new tweets but retweets and replies. Users also reported not being able to access their direct messages. Some users discovered a workaround by scheduling tweets one minute into the future. The service eventually returned at nearly 11pm GMT, however at the time of reporting, direct messages were still missing. At the time of reporting, Tweetdeck – a Twitter-owned service that allows users to view multiple columns of Twitter in browsers – remained down. There has been speculation that the product will become exclusive to Twitter Blue subscribers, but the company has yet to announce whether that is the case. Since Musk took over the company, Twitter no longer has a press department, but the Guardian sent questions to an email address the company has previously used to field press inquiries. US tech publication The Information reported Musk told Twitter staff to pause “new feature development” to maximise stability on the platform amid the outage. The disruption came just hours after Twitter rolled out a new product to Twitter Blue subscribers that allows them to send tweets with up to 4,000 characters. The company was also in the process of ending its free access to the application programming interface (API) on 9 February. The change will cut off a wide variety of services including Twitter thread readers, automated replies, and automatic tweet delete services.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/09/twitter-users-temporarily-unable-to-post-in-latest-outage-since-musk-takeover
48,twitter,Guardian,2023-02-08,Ex-Twitter exec details ‘homophobic and antisemitic’ abuse over handling of Hunter Biden story,"A former Twitter executive testified on Wednesday that he was forced to leave and sell his home following a campaign of “homophobic and antisemitic” harassment over the company’s handling of a New York Post story about Hunter Biden. Yoel Roth, the former head of safety at Twitter, made the comments while speaking to a committee in the newly Republican-controlled House of Representatives, at a hearing convened to scrutinize the social network’s handling of a 2020 report on Joe Biden’s son. Roth said the release of the so-called Twitter Files by Twitter’s new CEO, Elon Musk, led to a campaign of harassment against him and other employees. The harassment intensified when Musk and others amplified “defamatory” claims that he condones pedophilia, Roth said. The Twitter Files, shared by Musk in December 2022, was a series of internal records showing how the company initially stopped the story – which the Post said was based on a copy of Hunter Biden’s laptop hard drive from Donald Trump’s then personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani – from being shared, citing the company’s internal policy on “hacked materials” and concerns from Biden’s campaign, among other factors. Roth said the release of the Twitter Files, which included his name along with those of other decision makers at the company, had “very real consequences” for his safety. “This lie led directly to a wave of homophobic and antisemitic attacks against me … of which Twitter has removed vanishingly little. And following the Daily Mail’s decision to publish where I live. I had to leave my home and sell it.” Roth noted he was not the only one affected, saying lower-level Twitter staff around the world, including the Philippines, “had their families threatened and experienced harm equal to or greater than what I’ve experienced”. “Those are the consequences for this type of online harassment and speech,” he concluded. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat representing the District of Columbia, said Roth’s testimony showed the dangers of “legitimizing unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about the deep state, big tech and government and government censorship for political gain”. “Committee Republicans are holding a match to a powder keg,” she said. Her point was underscored when the extremist Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was temporarily banned from Twitter for sharing Covid-19 misinformation, used her questioning period to attack Roth, doubling down on unfounded and homophobic conspiracy theories. “I’m so glad you’ve lost your jobs,” she said. “I am so glad Elon Musk bought Twitter.” Wednesday’s hearing underscored a renewed interest from Republicans in wielding their power to pursue unproven claims that social media firms have anti-conservative biases, fanning partisan flames along the way. The lawmakers seem to have found an ally in Musk, who has given more fuel to such assertions with the Twitter Files and other tweets. Experts say Musk’s takeover of Twitter and sympathetic views towards such conspiracy theories could increase the risk for misinformation and harassment on the platform. “This is somebody who flirts with conspiracy theories, has regularly retweeted conspiracy theories has replatformed conspiracy theorists and hate-mongers and white supremacists and all kinds of nefarious actors,” Jessica J González, co-chief executive officer of the civil rights group Free Press, said of Musk. Other former senior Twitter staff, including Vijaya Gadde, the social network’s former chief legal officer, former deputy general counsel James Baker and former safety leader Anika Collier Navaroli, also testified in the hearing, stating that decisions around content moderation are complex and difficult. Democratic lawmakers said during the hearing that attacks on former Twitter staff were a “distraction” and that the witnesses had already declared under oath there was no collusion between the government and Twitter to suppress conservative speech. “We’re wasting our time here bullying former Twitter employees,” said Maxwell Frost, a Democratic representative from Florida. “I’ve been sitting here for over two hours and I’m not really seeing the point of this hearing.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/08/twitter-congress-hearing-homophobic-antisemitic-abuse-hunter-biden-elon-musk
49,twitter,Guardian,2023-02-08,Republicans grill ex-Twitter executives over handling of Hunter Biden story,"US lawmakers held a combative hearing on Wednesday with former senior staffers at Twitter over the social media platform’s handling of reporting on Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden. The proceedings set the stage for the agenda of a newly Republican-controlled House, underscoring its intention to home in on longstanding and unsubstantiated allegations that big tech platforms have an anti-conservative bias. The House oversight committee called for questioning recently departed Twitter employees including Vijaya Gadde, the social network’s former chief legal officer, former deputy general counsel James Baker, former head of safety and integrity Yoel Roth and former safety leader Anika Collier Navaroli. The hearing centered on a question that has long dogged Republicans – why Twitter decided to temporarily restrict the sharing of a story about Hunter Biden in the New York Post, released in October 2020, the month before the US presidential election. But lawmakers on both sides of the aisle used the opportunity to interrogate moderation practices at Twitter and other tech firms. “The government doesn’t have any role in suppressing speech,” said the Republican committee chairman, James Comer, hammering the former employees for censoring the Post story. In that report, the Post said it received a copy of a laptop hard drive from Donald Trump’s then-personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that Hunter Biden had dropped off 18 months earlier at a Delaware computer repair shop and never retrieved. Twitter initially blocked people from sharing links to the article for several days, citing concerns over misinformation and spreading a report containing potentially hacked materials. In opening statements on Wednesday, the former Twitter staffers described the process by which the story was blocked. While the company explicitly allowed “reporting on a hack, or sharing press coverage of hacking”, it blocked stories that shared “personal and private information – like email addresses and phone numbers” – which the Post story appeared to include. The platform amended these rules following the Biden controversy, and the then CEO, Jack Dorsey, later called the company’s communications about the Post article “not great”. Roth, the former head of safety and integrity, said on Wednesday that Twitter acknowledged that censoring the story was a mistake. “Defending free expression and maintaining the health of the platform required difficult judgment calls,” he said. “There is no easy way to run a global communications platform that satisfies business and revenue goals, individual customer expectations, local laws and cultural norms and get it right every time.” Elon Musk, who purchased the company last year, has since shared a series of internal records, known as the Twitter Files, showing how the company initially stopped the story being shared, citing concerns from the Biden campaign, among other factors. Republican theories that Democrats are colluding with big tech to suppress conservative speech have become a hot button issue in Washington, with Congress members using various tech hearings to grill executives. But experts say claims of anti-conservative bias have been disproven by independent researchers. “What we’ve seen time and again is that companies are de-platforming people who are spreading racism and conspiracy theories in violation of the company’s rule,” said Jessica J González, co-chief executive officer of the civil rights group Free Press. “The fact that those people are disproportionately Republicans has nothing to do with it,” she added. “This is about right or wrong, not left or right.” Musk’s decision to release information about the laptop story comes after he allowed the return of high-profile figures banned for spreading misinformation and engaging in hate speech, including the former president. The executive has shared and engaged with conspiracy theories on his personal account. Republican lawmakers seem to have found an ally in Musk, and repeatedly praised him during Wednesday’s proceedings. The rightwing congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene used her time on the floor to personally attack the former Twitter employees and complain about her own account, which was suspended for violating the platform’s policies on coronavirus misinformation. “I’m so glad you’ve lost your jobs,” she said. “I am so glad Elon Musk bought Twitter.” But Democrats on Wednesday used their time in the House to explore how the Trump administration engaged with Twitter, revealing that the former president himself tried to interfere with content decisions. In response to questioning from the new representative Maxwell Frost of Florida, the former Twitter content moderation executive Navaroli confirmed that in 2019 Trump tried to have an insulting tweet from internet personality Chrissy Teigen removed from the platform. In the tweet, which was read for the record, Teigen referred to Trump as a “pussy ass bitch”. Twitter denied the White House’s request, and it remains online today. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez further sought to disprove bias against conservative speech on Twitter when she asked about an instance in 2019, when a tweet from Trump including hate speech was kept online despite violating platform policies. The former president told Democratic congresswomen to “go back” to their countries, a clear violation of Twitter’s policies regarding abuse against immigrants, but was not penalized, Navaroli confirmed, and the rules were changed. “So Twitter changed their own policy after Trump violated it to accommodate his tweets?” Ocasio-Cortez said. “So much for bias against the right wing on Twitter.” The White House has sought to discredit the Republican investigation into Hunter Biden, calling them “divorced-from-reality political stunts”. Nonetheless, Republicans now hold subpoena power in the House, giving them the authority to compel testimony and conduct an aggressive investigation. In opening statements at Wednesday’s hearing, the Democratic representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland expressed frustration that the first tech-focused panel of the session is focused on the Hunter Biden story, which he called a “faux scandal”. He said private companies under the first amendment are free to decide what is allowed on their platforms. “Silly does not even begin to capture this obsession,” he said of the laptop story. “What’s more, Twitter’s editorial decision has been analyzed and debated ad nauseam. Some people think it was the right decision. Some people think it was the wrong decision. But the key point here is that it was Twitter’s decision.” The Associated Press contributed reporting",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/08/ex-twitter-execs-to-testify-in-congress-on-handling-of-hunter-biden-laptop-reporting
50,twitter,Guardian,2023-02-08,Twitter probably fumbled the Hunter Biden story. But don’t expect a sane investigation | Margaret Sullivan,"You can’t get Americans to agree on much these days – not on gas stoves, not on Chinese spy balloons, not on the books allowed in school libraries. But one thing they apparently can bond over is whether the Republicans in the House of Representatives are likely to spend the next two years responsibly serving as the loyal opposition to President Biden and the Democrats who control the Senate. Checks, balances and all that good stuff. The consensus: fat chance. Most Americans, in an NBC poll, think Republicans will spend too much time on investigations; a CNN poll showed three out of four respondents agreeing that House Republicans haven’t been paying enough attention to things that matter; a Pew Research poll finds two-thirds of Americans are concerned that they will focus too much on investigating the Biden administration. In other words, the public has seen enough grandstanding to know exactly what’s coming. “The GOP’s investigations are going to be drawn from a grab bag of rightwing grievances,” as Hayes Brown, an MSNBC editor, recently predicted. Things kick off in earnest on Wednesday morning with the House oversight committee taking up how Twitter handled a controversial New York Post story about Hunter Biden’s laptop, back in the fall of 2020. Will this committee stay grounded in reality as members explore legitimate questions? I’m not hopeful, especially after hearing committee chairman James Comer, Republican of Kentucky, speculating on Fox News a few days ago about the Chinese spy balloon. Comer suggested that the balloon might be loaded with bioweapons, and then went full Trump: “Did that balloon take off from Wuhan?” Comer is the same guy who suggested back in December, again preaching to the Fox News faithful, that the Brittney Griner prisoner swap may had some tie to Hunter Biden. (Well, yes, of course, because in the Republican conspiracy world, everything must have that same diabolical connection.) Then there’s the oversight committee’s Republican membership, which includes Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Jim Jordan of Ohio and Lauren Boebert of Colorado. Not exactly a Mount Rushmore of governmental statesmanship. Get out your tin-foil hats and, while you’re at it, your earplugs. It’s too bad, because Congress’s oversight role is a crucial one. What’s more, the way Twitter handled the New York Post story really was dubious, as Jack Dorsey, then the CEO, has acknowledged. The Murdoch-owned paper reported in the fall of 2020 that it had received a copy of a hard drive of a laptop that Hunter Biden had left many months before at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved, and that it included emails that showed attempted influence peddling by then vice-president Joe Biden’s wayward son. For several days, Twitter blocked users from sharing links to the story. To be sure, skepticism and caution were in order. Was there reason to wonder whether such a laptop even belonged to Hunter Biden? Was there reason on Twitter’s part to fear that the whole thing was part of a Russian disinformation campaign and thus to be wary of spreading it weeks before a presidential election? Again, legitimate questions. “We want to make sure that our national security is not compromised” is Comer’s explanation for bringing the former Twitter executives in for a grilling. (They are the former chief legal officer, Vijaya Gadde, former deputy general counsel James Baker, and former global head of trust and safety Yoel Roth.) Dorsey himself later called his company’s decision to block the story without communicating the reasons “unacceptable”. Major news organizations, meanwhile – considering the dubious source and unable to verify the facts in real time – held the New York Post’s article at arm’s length, while not entirely ignoring it. One reason for caution: as the Washington Post wrote in an October 2020 analysis, the article repeated the debunked claim, spread by then president Trump, that Joe Biden, vice-president at the time of the alleged influence peddling, had pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor at his son’s behest. But the media’s hesitancy to play up the story brought howls of partisan censorship from the right – especially because the presidential election was right around the corner. Speaking to the National Press Club recently, committee chairman Comer talked a good game about how he wants to lead his committee with transparency and bipartisanship, hewing closely to the mission of rooting out government fraud and mismanagement. He unveiled a long list of targets to investigate, from prescription drug pricing to the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, and of course, the inappropriate involvements of family members, which never seemed to trouble Republicans about the Trump clan. Comer claimed the high ground: “I want [it] to be a substantive committee.” I would love to believe that. But since what’s past is prologue, I will not be holding my breath.

51,twitter,Guardian,2023-02-07,TechScape: Why Twitter ending free access to its APIs should be a ‘wake-up call’,"APIs may not seem like the sexiest thing to write about in a tech newsletter, but bear with me. Because APIs – or application programming interfaces – are important. They’re the synapses of our digital world: without them, our current ways of living wouldn’t work. For example, when you visit a website that requires you to log in, and you choose to connect with a Google or Facebook account, you’re utilising an API. That click of a button that links your existing account on one platform with a new account on another is enabled by an API. They spring into action whenever one type of work interacts with another, working to bridge that gap. APIs are the overlooked and under-praised army that keeps the internet as we know it going. From Thursday, many of those features will disappear from Twitter as its API goes behind a paywall. The company announced last week that it was removing free access to its API. “The latest set of changes to Twitter will likely spell the end of some of your favourite accounts, tools and features, as the platform’s owner, Elon Musk, continues to look for ways to increase revenue,” the Guardian reported. Those tools include services like Thread Reader, which unrolls Twitter threads into easily digestible formats, and @EarthquakeBot, which tracks weather events and natural disasters like earthquakes, as well as tools that big brands use for their customer services. The importance of APIs “APIs are an area fraught with competing tensions,” says Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert and professor at the University of Surrey. “Probably the most sensational failure was when Facebook allowed the survey ultimately used by Cambridge Analytica to harvest sensitive data about users and their friends.” On Twitter, API access was more “benign”, Woodward says – limited mainly to posting via third-party apps that allow an element of automation. Perhaps more concerning is that the change in API access spells the end of academic research using Twitter. For instance, one recent academic paper that looks at all the activity on a single day on Twitter would not be possible now without paying out for access. It’s also a wake-up call, says researcher Philipp Lorenz-Spreen, for the public to show that their data can be monetised in ways they have no control over. “The research community in my field has always been dependent on access to the data of the very platforms they aim to study, which is an intolerable situation for independent research and now it is even more pronounced,” he says. Woodward puts it this way: “APIs are quite important to those doing research on Twitter … if he cuts this access off then some of the transparency provided by third-party researchers is likely to disappear.” The move will also affect the apps and services that use Twitter. “People find useful tools or services that are built on top of it, academics use it for data, companies that use it to connect with customers,” says Kate Bevan, a long-tenured tech writer who believes Musk’s API change is significant – and bad – news. Bevan is also the human behind @DaphneFlap, a Twitter bot that relies on API access for its existence, posting a photograph of the cat flap through which a cat named Daphne leaps every time a movement is sensed. “We take APIs for granted.” Musk’s prevarications The API shift has been almost universally panned – which may explain why Elon Musk has decided to backtrack, sort of. On 5 February, he tweeted that “Twitter will enable a light, write-only API for bots providing good content that is free.” What exactly constitutes “good content” isn’t known. Presumably, it doesn’t include @ElonJet, an account that used automated API interactions between publicly available flight-tracking data and Twitter to post the flight times and locations of Musk’s private jet – an action that the entrepreneur called “real-time assassination co-ordinates”. (@ElonJet was banned in December 2022.) “I can’t help but conclude that this move has been brought about because some of the fun bots have irritated people in high places,” says Woodward. “Good content” as per Musk might be more like @PepitoTheCat, a Twitter account that also takes a photograph every time a cat named Pépito goes through its owners’ cat flap: after all, Musk’s volte face happened in response to pleas from that account’s owner that Musk’s policy change would “kill” his profile. But the change, apart from being alarming, also highlights a contradiction in Musk’s goals for Twitter. He has heavily touted the Twitter Files during his time in charge of the company – a cache of internal documents, selectively given to journalists with whom he has existing relationships, which contain information he alleges proves that the platform prior to his ownership engaged in opaque decision-making around key policies. Yet by saying that he’ll exempt people creating “good content” from API limitations and charges, he’s perpetuating the same problem. It tackles one problem he says he sought to buy Twitter to solve – its plethora of bots, which he felt was diminishing the value of real, human interactions on the site. But it could exacerbate another problem which he said was significant enough for him to buy the platform for $44bn in the first place. Musk is introducing a lack of transparency and editorialising about what had been a simple proposition: anyone who wanted access to Twitter’s API could get it free of charge. Now, it depends on whether they produce content that appeals to his whims. It’s yet another example of the perils of semi-public platforms being controlled by individuals. And an example of the impact that removing or revoking access to a relatively unrecognised backbone of the internet can have on everyday users.

52,twitter,Guardian,2023-02-03,Some popular accounts likely to disappear from Twitter as Elon Musk ends free access to API,"The latest set of changes to Twitter will likely spell the end of some of your favourite accounts, tools and features, as the platform’s owner, Elon Musk, continues to look for ways to increase revenue. In a post on Thursday morning, Twitter’s developer account announced free access to its application program interface (API) would be cut off and replaced with a paid version from 9 February. The API provides access to Twitter data, which can be used to create third-party apps, automated bots, customer service tools for brands, and enables researchers to report on trends or patterns on the site. While many larger companies already pay for access, it is unlikely some of the smaller developers of popular tools and accounts will be able or willing to pay. Here’s a roundup of some popular tools and accounts that could disappear once the pay-for-access API comes into effect. Thread readers When someone posts a long thread of tweets on a topic, often someone will @ the thread reader app, which will generate the content of those tweets in a more readable format. Possum photos every hour Many automated accounts are made for fun, such as those that tweet out photographs or artwork at regular intervals. Regretfully, the Possum Every Hour account has already announced it will cease operating once the changes are brought in, but it says its work will continue on Twitter’s rival network Mastodon. Auto-delete services Twitter lacks a function to allow you to delete your tweets en masse or automatically, so third-party apps using Twitter’s API have filled that gap. Many of them charge, which suggests they might already pay Twitter for API access, but the changes could spell doom for others. Weather, environment and health trackers Earthquake bots and other accounts set up to post automatic updates on the weather, environment or health issues such as Covid can be extremely useful. They generally work by scraping data from other sites and automatically tweeting it using the Twitter API. Often they’re run on a volunteer basis, and not-for-profit, so they could also be in trouble following the changes. Brand customer service accounts If you’re a social media manager at a big company, you might use Hootsuite or a similar platform to keep tabs on the company’s social accounts and track customer complaints. That too relies on Twitter’s API. The first hint Twitter would clamp down on use of the API was in mid-January when Twitter suddenly shut off access for Tweetbot, a third-party Twitter app optimised for Apple products. The move was not initially explained, but the company later said it was enforcing a long-held policy. Twitter’s move to charge for API access is the latest in a string of changes Elon Musk has made since he took over the company in an effort to make it profitable. Twitter has not said what it will charge for basic API access, nor has it indicated whether the charge will apply to all users of the API, including researchers. Twitter no longer has a communications department to approach for comment, but questions were sent to the email address previously used by the organisation to field press enquiries.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/03/some-popular-accounts-likely-to-disappear-from-twitter-as-elon-musk-ends-free-access-to-api
53,twitter,Guardian,2023-01-27,"Elon Musk ‘doesn’t seem like’ right person to own Twitter, says co-founder","Elon Musk “doesn’t seem like” the right person to own Twitter, the social media platform’s co-founder has said, adding that improvements to morale and content policies at the business have been reversed under its new proprietor. In an interview with the Guardian, Biz Stone said positive changes he had helped oversee in recent years had been unwound by the Tesla chief executive. Stone said running social media companies is “not really a win-win situation … it’s always tough”, because “50% of the people are gonna be happy, 50% of people are gonna be upset with you”. “You have to be OK with stuff that you just don’t like or don’t agree with being on there,” said Stone, adding: “Otherwise, you should just go buy a magazine or a newspaper or something where it’s OK to have a specific leaning.” Asked if Musk was the right owner for Twitter, Stone said: “It doesn’t seem like it right now, but I could be wrong.” Musk has come under fire for temporarily banning journalists from the platform and reinstating previously banned accounts such as those belonging to the former US president Donald Trump and the self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate. Stone, who co-founded Twitter in 2006 with Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass and Evan Williams, returned to the business in 2017 at the behest of thenchief executive Dorsey to “guide the company culture, that energy, that feeling”. Stone said improvements during his four-year stint, particularly in morale and overseeing content, have been lost under Musk. “We made a lot of improvements in those areas. And that’s all gone now.” Musk has rowed back on a pledge to establish a “content moderation council” that would have overseen big content decisions and account reinstatements, instead relying on more arbitrary methods such as user polls hosted on his own Twitter account. He also fired approximately half of Twitter’s workforce within days of buying the business for $44bn (£35bn) last year. Stone added that employees should not have been named as part of the release of the so-called Twitter files, a series of internal documents detailing decisions such as the suspension of Donald Trump. “When that happens, people get a lot of harassment,” said Stone. “It’s really bad.” Twitter’s former head of trust and safety, Yoel Roth, was reportedly forced to leave his home when Musk posted tweets misrepresenting Roth’s 2016 academic thesis, “Gay Data”. Stone said the concept of Twitter would survive, regardless of the company’s current financial struggles. “I don’t know that Twitter as a company is going to succeed for ever but the idea of Twitter I think will be around,” said Stone, pointing to the success of alternative platforms such as Mastodon. “It would only matter that Twitter the idea continued. And that’s happened. That seems to be happening already. Mastodon seems to be winning the open-source, decentralised version of Twitter. People seem to be going there.” He added: “I don’t know the future. I don’t know what’s gonna happen and maybe things will be great in a year and [it] had to go through this trial by fire. But, right now it does not look good, I would say.” Stone spoke to the Guardian as he confirmed he is joining the board of Chroma, a Swedish startup in which he is also an investor. Chroma creates an audio-visual experience for mobile phone users, describing itself as “a world of sound experiences in a pocket” where users can change what they see and hear. Describing Chroma’s work as “soundplay”, Stone added: “It’s a new way to interact with sound and to play with sound.” Last year Chroma collaborated with Venezuelan musician Arca to create Lux Aeterna, an app that creates an “ever-evolving, boundless audio-visual world”. Stone said his investment philosophy is simple – “do I like this person” and “do I think they can pull off this thing I would use myself?” He adds: “If those two answers are yes, I’m usually in.” Referring to Chroma’s CEO and founder, Andreas Pihlström, he said: “I like working with Andreas. He is a really talented designer.” Stone’s co-investors in Chroma include Evan Sharp, the co-founder of digital pinboard platform Pinterest, and Ben Silbermann, the co-founder and CEO of Pinterest, where Pihlström worked as a creative director. Stone, who has also invested in the messaging service Slack and Pinterest, added that he never thought of Twitter as being successful when he co-founded it in San Francisco. “I tell young people – if you’re doing something to try to get rich, it’s probably not going to work. You should do something that you’re just really enjoying working on and then you actually have a greater chance of becoming wealthy.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/27/elon-musk-doesnt-seem-like-right-person-to-own-twitter-says-co-founder
54,twitter,Guardian,2023-01-25,Indian ban on BBC Modi film puts Musk’s Twitter ‘free speech’ vow to the test,"The response by the Indian government was quick and draconian. Days after a BBC documentary examining the role that Narendra Modi, now prime minister, had played in 2002 communal riots in Gujarat was released, the information ministry announced that all links to the footage were to be banned on social media. Emergency laws brought in by the Modi government just two years ago were used to enforce the ban. Both Twitter and YouTube quickly complied with the government’s censorship requests. Posts on about 50 Twitter accounts were removed, with activists, politicians and even Hollywood actors among those affected, as well as an unspecified number of YouTube channels. Widely shared clips of the documentary, which alleged that Modi, in his role as chief minister of Gujarat at the time, had enabled and then did nothing to stop the violence in which almost 1,000 Muslims were killed, quickly disappeared from Indian social media. It is not the first time the Modi government has used the 2021 information technology rules to censor online content critical of the administration. However, the action taken over the BBC documentary is among the most high-profile use of the legislation and sheds light on the fragile and fractious place that social media such as Twitter now occupy in India and directly pits the vow of the platform’s new billionaire owner, Elon Musk, to be a “free speech absolutist” against increasingly authoritarian laws governing the country’s online sphere. Widely criticised by human rights groups and digital activists, the 2021 IT rules give the government power to remove any content it deems to threaten “the unity, integrity, defence, security or sovereignty of India”. Even before the passing of the legislation, legal demands made by the Modi government to remove content from Twitter increased by 48,000% between 2014 and 2020, according to analysis of the company’s transparency reports. The two-part BBC series documenting the rise of Modi has proved highly controversial in India, despite it only being released in the UK, prompting allegations from the Indian foreign ministry that it was “biased propaganda” that showed a “blatant colonial mindset”. Kanchan Gupta, a spokesperson for the information ministry, called the documentary “hostile propaganda and anti-India garbage” and students who arranged a screening at a university in Kerala this week were accused of being “treasonous”. At Delhi’s prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University, students who tried the same were hit with an electricity and internet blackout, and had stones thrown at them by others from rightwing groups. The BBC has said its documentary was “rigorously researched according to highest editorial standards”. Many have cited their compliance with the online censorship of the documentary as an example of how Twitter and YouTube are helping to further erode freedom of speech in India, in order to appease the Modi government and not compromise access to the vast and increasingly online Indian population. There are over 40 million Twitter users in India, making it their third largest market after Japan and the US. “This use of an emergency law as a censorship mechanism is a very worrying development but it’s far from the first time this has happened,” said Prateek Waghre, the policy director at the advocacy group the Internet Freedom Foundation in India. According to a statement to parliament in July, action was taken against 94 YouTube channels, 19 social media accounts and 747 URLs on the government’s request since the IT rules were passed. Before Musk’s takeover, Twitter had pushed back – though somewhat inconsistently – against the Modi government’s increasingly heavy-handed approach towards social media. Twitter had restored some of the accounts the administration had demanded the removal of and in July last year filed a lawsuit in Indian courts alleging New Delhi had abused its power by ordering the company to arbitrarily and disproportionately take down accounts belonging to government critics. Twitter still reports all the posts and accounts it removes at the request of the Indian government to the online database Lumen. YouTube, however, does not. Yet for all his protestations to be a crusader for free speech, there are indicators that Musk’s Twitter might be far less bullish in standing up to the Modi government. When Musk was trying to back out of the deal to buy the platform, he made it clear in the court filings that he was unhappy with the lawsuit against the Indian government, saying he believed moderation should “hew close to the laws of countries in which Twitter operates”. Among the Indian accounts that have been reinstated since Musk took over is that of Kangana Ranaut, a fiercely pro-Modi actor who has espoused anti-Muslim sentiments and was suspended in 2021 for posts that were seen as a call to violence against minorities. On taking over, he has not mentioned the lawsuit once but did fire almost all 200 of Twitter’s employees in India. Separately, Musk’s car company, Tesla, is lobbying India’s government to reduce import taxes on electric vehicles so it can have access to the lucrative Indian market. Waghre said Musk’s position on championing free speech on Twitter, already wildly inconsistent, was likely to be “severely tested in India”, as the furore around the BBC documentary had proven. “We’re talking about pressures on freedom of speech in the world’s largest democracy,” Waghre said. “Musk’s pledge has rung hollow everywhere, but in India the impact will certainly be larger.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/25/india-ban-on-bbc-modi-film-elon-musk-twitter-free-speech-emergency-laws
55,twitter,Guardian,2023-01-25,How I would fix Twitter if I were CEO | Margaret Sullivan ,"Elon Musk and I aren’t exactly old friends, but we do go back quite a few years – to early 2013 when I was the public editor (a kind of ombudswoman) at the New York Times. The Tesla head honcho was harshly accusing the paper of sabotage after its review of some new ultra-fast charging stations. The Times review featured a devastating photograph of the cherry-red Model S on a flatbed truck after it reportedly ran out of juice on the last leg of the road trip. My investigation determined that the Times did nothing unethical, though I found some of the reviewer’s methods less than ideal. I don’t think either Musk or the Times was particularly thrilled with my findings. Now, a decade later, Musk and I could be ready for a new adventure – an even more contentious one. The tech-news website CNET recently suggested me as a potential chief executive for Twitter, the global social media platform which Musk has been busy running into the ground after buying it for a stunning $44bn last fall. The company has lost about half of its top advertisers since Musk took over, and stands to lose 30 million users over the next two years, according to various estimates. Under fire in late December, Musk tweeted that he would resign as CEO “as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job”. While it may be exceedingly unlikely that I, or someone like me, would ever get the nod over any of the tech bros commonly considered for such jobs, I nonetheless enjoyed thinking about what I’d do if it came my way. And I’ve talked with people who are much more knowledgable, picking their brains on what needs to happen to save the site that has become such an important source of information and connection for millions worldwide. So, if I ran Twitter, here’s what I’d do on day one (and beyond): First, start putting out the multiple dumpster fires blazing in Twitter HQ. Advertisers and users alike have been fleeing in droves for good reason. The platform is a chaotic mess; increasingly a haven for hateful and dangerous content, and day by day less satisfying and more frustrating to use. So the first step needs to be a strong public message that reform is imminent: that trust and safety are a top priority, and that some of the worst changes would be immediately reviewed and likely reversed. “Bring back a sense of normalcy and process,” Casey Newton, the technology journalist who founded the excellent tech newsletter Platformer, told me in an interview. These can’t be empty words, of course. So a new leader must figure out how to turn good intentions into reality. That means finding the right people to carry out content moderation and make solid operational and strategic decisions. Although Twitter has lost many of its best employees in recent months – either because they’ve fled or been fired – there undoubtedly still is internal talent and knowledge. And who knows, it might even be possible to persuade some of the best of the former staffers to come back. One thing I found out in the 13 years that I led the newsroom at my hometown paper, the Buffalo News, is you can’t accomplish anything on your own. You need strong, smart, knowledgable, trustworthy people by your side who aren’t afraid to tell you when you’re wrong. And you need to take heed. Second, figure out a new vision for Twitter’s future. The platform is big, influential and well known, but it desperately needs to grow and develop new ways to create revenue; that could involve forays into e-commerce or paid premium subscriptions or monetizing new tools for the creators who make Twitter worthwhile. Mike Masnick, founder of the website Techdirt, told me that it would be helpful to re-enable outsiders – known as third-party developers – to come up with ways to make Twitter more useful. (Think Tweetdeck.) They would need to be given at least partial access to Twitter’s internal information, something that’s fraught with privacy issues and other potential problems, but he thinks it’s not impossible. He mentions as one example the startup Block Party, founded by entrepreneur Tracy Chou, intended to protect against online harassment and abuse. As Masnick put it, “You don’t have to take on all the work yourself.” Third, hire a public editor or, more likely, a team of public editors. Twitter’s users are frustrated by the way the platform works – or doesn’t work – now. It would help to have a place to transmit their complaints and have them taken seriously. An ombudsperson can listen to what users are saying, take those complaints to the leadership, and get some answers that could be communicated publicly. At least, as Masnick noted, it would be a powerful gesture in the direction of accountability. The public editor role – I can attest from my New York Times experience – functions as a steam valve and, as such, can prevent explosions. Of course, there’s a real question about whether Twitter – in just a few months – has self-destructed so thoroughly that it’s no longer worth saving. And there’s another real question about whether Musk, despite his words, would really be willing to step aside enough to let a new CEO do her job. For most of my career, I’ve worked successfully at media companies owned by billionaires, some of the richest people on the planet. First, Warren Buffett at the Buffalo News, my hometown paper where I started as a summer intern and became the first woman top editor; and more recently, Jeff Bezos at the Washington Post, where I was the paper’s media columnist for six years, mostly during the legendary Marty Baron’s stint as executive editor. Both Buffett and Bezos made it easier for those running their media operations – they trusted their appointed people and didn’t interfere editorially. So, one key to running Twitter is the tricky matter of “managing up”. Anyone who’s ever worked in a corporation or big agency, especially as a manager, knows that you have to handle the boss. You have to keep them informed, hold off their worst instincts, tactfully set boundaries and, most of all, somehow convince them that every move you make is really their brilliant idea – or at least a fulfillment of their underlying vision. And there’s the rub. Twitter’s problems are solvable. But the volatile and narcissistic Musk may be the boss that can’t be managed.

56,twitter,Guardian,2023-01-24,Twitter sued in London and San Francisco over alleged unpaid rent,"Twitter is being sued by landlords in San Francisco and London after failing to pay rent on its offices, as new owner Elon Musk takes on extreme cost-cutting strategies that reportedly include simply not paying the bills. The crown estate in London, which manages property belonging to King Charles III, filed a claim against Twitter in the high court in the UK capital last week. The alleged rental arrears relate to office space near Piccadilly Circus in central London, according to the BBC. The owner of Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters has also sued Twitter after it failed to make its latest monthly rent payment for January, amounting to $3.4m, according to documents filed on Friday with the superior court of California. This comes after a report earlier this month stated that Twitter owed $136,260 in overdue rent on a separate office in San Francisco and was facing a lawsuit. Also in January, workers at a Twitter office in Singapore were evicted due to unpaid rent on the building. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The actions came only a few months after Twitter was taken over by Elon Musk, the co-owner of Tesla and SpaceX, in October last year. Musk paid $44bn (£36bn) for the platform and quickly initiated sweeping job cuts to the firm’s 7,000-strong workforce – cutting it by 50%. Musk’s takeover has not been without issues, including a chaotic relaunch of the blue tick scheme for verified users that led to a number of impersonator accounts and advertisers withdrawing from the platform over concerns about a rise in hate speech. The social media company was reportedly hit by a 40% drop in revenue after more than 500 clients paused their spending, with high-profile brands such as Audi and Pfizer halting advertising. The BBC reported that the crown estate took legal action after previously contacting the social media company about the alleged rental arrears at its office space. John Wallace, a solicitor and director at the London-based law firm Ridgemont, said the hearing between the crown estate and Twitter was likely to take place in the next six months and warned that the UK’s struggling economy could lead to an increase in rent arrears claims. He said: “The receding of the UK’s economy will inevitably lead to commercial landlords having to take action against non-paying tenants. “I would expect to see a sharp rise in commercial rent arrears claims in second and third quarters of 2023, given the Office for Budget Responsibility’s prediction that a recession will last until at least autumn 2023.” The estate is one of the largest landowners in the UK, and although the portfolio belongs to the monarch, it is not private property. The revenue from the estate goes to the Treasury for public spending and in return the monarch receives the sovereign grant. Musk’s property woes are just the latest legal headache for the billionaire, who has been testifying in recent days in a separate class-action lawsuit from Tesla investors alleging his 2017 tweet misled them about funding to take the electric carmaker private.

57,twitter,Guardian,2023-01-24,Chanel’s elegant show is the quiet eye of a Twitter storm at Paris fashion week,"It was Coco herself who said fashion reflects the world we live in. But while much of fashion week holds up a mirror to the current era of roiling controversy and outrage – at Schiaparelli, a foam lion’s head worn by Kylie Jenner provoked social media fury from distressed animal lovers, until the president of Peta rode unexpectedly to couture’s rescue by saying the look “celebrates lion’s beauty” – Chanel is the quiet eye of the storm. Virginie Viard, who replaced the great showman Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel four years ago, has introduced an understated mood here. The animals of Coco’s elegant Paris apartment – where marble lions stood guard alongside pairs of carved wooden deer, and a lucky gold frog took pride of place on a coffee table – were the theme for her latest haute couture show. In contrast to Schiaparelli’s Instagram-bait of Kardashians and faux-taxidermy, the Trojan camels, stags and birds at Chanel were abstract plywood sculptures by artist Xavier Veilhan, and the models who emerged from them wore demure glitter tweed suits. Drama came with a light touch, in circus-master top hats and bow ties worn as chokers. Nonetheless, Chanel will have the lion’s share of the spotlight this year. A major exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum in New York honouring the career of Lagerfeld, who spent four decades at Chanel, will be followed by a major retrospective of Coco herself at the V&amp;A in London later this year. Backstage before the show, Chanel’s president of fashion, Bruno Pavlovsky, said he had “seen the layout of the Met exhibition – it is fantastic. I worked with Karl for many years, and he was forever talking about the latest Met show. He really loved the museum.” Pavlovsky was also waiting to discover which of Chanel’s red carpet ambassadors would receive Oscar nominations. Last year was a successful award season for Chanel, who dressed best actress nominees Kristen Stewart and Penélope Cruz. “We have fantastic actors who can help talk about our brand, so anytime when we can help them to be at their best is very important for us,” Pavlovsky said. “We try to position ourselves as a supportive partner – it is a case of whatever they want, when they want it.” Chanel’s relationship with Hollywood began in 1931, when Gabrielle Chanel was invited by movie mogul Sam Goldwyn, who sent a welcoming party that included Greta Garbo to meet her from her train. Chanel will stage a major Cruise catwalk show in Los Angeles in May, one week after the Met Gala launches the Lagerfeld exhibition. “In New York, we celebrate 40 years of Karl – and then we head straight to LA to show a new collection and talk about the future. It will be a busy week for everyone, especially with [the coronation of] Charles III in between. But you cannot be Chanel just by staying in an apartment on the first floor of the 1st arrondissement of Paris.” In September, the V&amp;A will showcase “the modern style of an era when star designers, of who Mademoiselle Chanel was one, defined so much of modern fashion”, said Pavlovsky. “For me, there is no contradiction between the past and future of Chanel.”",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jan/24/chanel-elegant-show-is-the-quiet-eye-of-a-twitter-storm-at-paris-fashion-week
58,twitter,Guardian,2023-01-23,"Twitter to launch ad-free subscription tier, Elon Musk says","Twitter is planning an advertising-free version of its subscription product, as the company attempts to raise revenue and increase demand for its premium offering. Elon Musk has targeted an increase in subscription revenue as a key part of the social media platform’s business plan under his ownership. The Tesla chief executive tweeted: “There will be a higher priced subscription that allows zero ads.” Twitter relaunched its premium offering for the second time under Musk in December, offering users perks including verified account status for $8 (£6.50) a month on the web or $11 a month for iPhone and Android phone users. Advertising accounted for 90% of Twitter’s revenue in 2021 but has fallen away since Musk bought the business last October, with daily revenue reportedly dropping 40% compared with last year. Advertisers including the carmaker Audi and the drugs firm Pfizer have paused spending on Twitter amid fears of a rise in hate speech on the platform, compounded by a botched revamp of Twitter Blue in November that led to pranksters paying for verified status in order to launch fake corporate accounts. Tweeting on Saturday, Musk added that despite the advertising downturn, ads were too frequent on the platform and “too big”. He added: “Taking steps to address both in coming weeks.” Musk aims to reduce Twitter’s dependency on advertising as payment looms for an interest payment on the $13bn of debt he loaded on the company as part of the takeover. According to reports, Twitter is due to make a quarterly payment of $300m this month, potentially as soon as this week. Musk told staff in November that Twitter might not survive a forthcoming downturn without a substantial increase in subscription income. “Without significant subscription revenue, there is a good chance Twitter will not survive the upcoming economic downturn. We need roughly half of our revenue to be subscription,” he wrote in a company-wide email. Twitter Blue is available in the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Musk has likened Twitter to a “plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don’t work” and has flagged the prospect of bankruptcy for a business that he bought for $44bn. However, last month Musk played down the prospect of the company going bust, saying it was “not on the fast lane to bankruptcy any more”.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/23/twitter-ad-free-subscription-tier-elon-musk-advertising
59,twitter,Guardian,2023-01-22,Is Elon Musk’s Twitter in too much trouble to cover its debts?,"Elon Musk sold a statue of Twitter’s bird logo last week for $100,000 – and he needs the money. The social media platform that he owns reportedly faces an interest payment of about $300m (£242m) on its debt as soon as this week, amid difficult financial conditions for the company. Twitter has been a loss-making business, even in the good times, but its problems have worsened since it was bought by the Tesla chief executive less than three months ago. Musk himself has raised the spectre of Twitter entering chapter 11 bankruptcy, although he has since played that prospect down. How much trouble is Twitter in, months after it was bought by the world’s second richest man? How much money must Twitter pay banks next week? According to reports, the first quarterly payment on the $13bn worth of debt used by Musk to buy Twitter must be paid by the end of the month. Analysts put the amount at approximately $300m, or a quarter of the estimated $1.2bn in annual interest payments due. The debt, which sits on Twitter’s balance sheet and is loaned by a consortium of banks led by Morgan Stanley, comprises: a $6.5bn senior secured term loan facility (a bank loan); a $3bn senior secured bridge loan facility (a loan to tide over the company post-acquisition that, conventionally, is paid off with the proceeds of a bond issue); and a $3bn senior unsecured bridge loan facility. Twitter also has a $500m senior secured revolving facility, which is effectively a corporate overdraft. Can Twitter afford the $300m payment? Musk warned soon after taking over Twitter that the company could go bankrupt. He also revealed a sharp drop in advertising revenue, which accounts for 90% of Twitter’s turnover, caused by clients’ concern over moderation standards post-takeover and a botched relaunch of Twitter’s subscription service, which led to a rash of fake “verified” corporate accounts. The advertising situation has not improved. It was reported last week that Twitter’s daily revenue has slumped by 40%. Its cashflow – a proxy of its ability to meet debt payments – is poor and in 2021 it generated negative free cashflow (spending more cash to run the business than it takes in) of $370.4m. Musk had warned that loss was heading towards $3bn this year but now expects it to break even. Musk told a podcast last month that Twitter is “not on the fast lane to bankruptcy any more”. He has also said Twitter has a net cash position of $1bn, which would at least cover next week’s payment along with the $500m overdraft. “Twitter should have no problem making its interest payment in late January, which could be funded with cash on hand or its revolving credit facility,” says Jordan Chalfin, a senior analyst at the credit research firm CreditSights. “Longer term, the company needs to turn around the business, particularly its advertising revenue, in order to service its debt.” Can Musk fund Twitter from his personal fortune? To buy Twitter, Musk put in more than $20bn of his own money, alongside $7.1bn from associates and about $4bn from his existing stake in the company. Last year, he sold $23bn worth of shares in Tesla, presumably to fund his part of the deal. More than 60% of Musk’s remaining stake in Tesla has been pledged “to secure certain personal indebtedness”, which leaves him with about $67bn worth of shares he can sell immediately, says Ben Silverman, director of research at VerityData. Musk therefore has the means to support Twitter financially, if he wishes. However, he said in December, not for the first time, that he was not planning to sell more Tesla shares. “I won’t sell stock until, I don’t know, probably two years from now. Definitely not next year under any circumstances and probably not the year thereafter,” Musk said. Is bankruptcy or restructuring the debt an option? If Musk defaults on an interest payment, Twitter could enter chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, where a company is sheltered from creditors temporarily while it attempts to restructure its finances. This would put Musk’s entire equity investment, and the billions put in by his associates, at risk. Another option would be to renegotiate the debt. “When the banks look at Musk, they are looking beyond just Twitter,” says Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College law school. “They are also looking at potential future business with Tesla, SpaceX. They may decide that it’s worth it to them to take 50 cents on the dollar in order to keep open the possibility of future business with Twitter and the rest of the Musk universe.” However, banks could seek a stake in Twitter as part of any restructuring, which would dilute Musk’s control. In the long term, Musk has to get advertisers back, or rapidly increase subscriptions to Twitters’ premium product, Blue, in order to avoid humbling options.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/22/elon-musk-twitter-debt
60,twitter,Guardian,2023-01-19,"$100,000 for a bird statue: the results of the Twitter office auction are in","What do you get the tech fan who has everything? Perhaps a statue of Twitter’s bright-blue logo, for a mere $100,000. That’s what the priciest item went for at an auction of the company’s office supplies, according to the BBC. The sale marks the latest episode in the continuing saga of Elon Musk’s $44bn takeover of the company, which has generated seemingly endless chaos – from sudden policy changes to the elimination of thousands of jobs. Heritage Global Partners, which ran the auction, has not released sales figures, but the BBC and SFGate caught a few highlights: A 10ft tall neon Twitter sign, perhaps a nice companion piece to the statue, sold for a mere $40,000. A 6ft tall planter in the shape of the @ symbol – which is, of course, an icon of the platform – closed at $15,500, according to SFGate. A conference table made from reclaimed wood closed at nearly $10,500. A fancy espresso machine from La Marzocco went for about $13,500 – less than half its retail value – while an Eames chair apparently saw added value thanks to its Twitter associations. Normally, it would go for $1,195, but Twitter’s chair went for at least $1,400, as a company engineer pointed out. Other items on sale included kegerators (AKA beer fridges), a rotisserie oven and a “high-performance task chair” – in short, everything you need for a productive day in Silicon Valley. The sale comes after Musk himself warned of a “massive drop in revenue” in November. Reports on Wednesday pointed to a 40% plunge year-over-year as advertisers pause spending. But that’s not why the items are being auctioned, according to Heritage. A representative told Fortune in December that the auction “has nothing to do with their financial position”, adding: “If anyone genuinely thinks that the revenue from selling a couple computers and chairs will pay for the mountain there, then they’re a moron.” Then again, he didn’t mention the statue.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/19/twitter-auction-bird-statue-elon-musk
61,twitter,Guardian,2023-01-18,"Twitter hit by 40% revenue drop amid ad squeeze, say reports","Twitter remains in the grip of an advertising squeeze, with the social media platform hit by a 40% drop in revenue after more than 500 clients paused their spending, according to reports. The company’s daily revenue was down 40% year-over-year, the tech newsletter the Platformer reported, while the news site the Information said staff were told more than 500 of Twitter’s top advertisers had halted spending since Elon Musk bought it in October. Advertising is the main source of income for Twitter, accounting for more than 90% of its $5.1bn in revenue in 2021, but clients including Audi and Pfizer are among the firms that have paused after the Tesla CEO’s $44bn (£35bn) takeover. Concerns about an increase in hate speech on the platform after its acquisition by a self-described “free speech absolutist” have prompted advertisers to withdraw in droves. They have also been alarmed by a spate of impersonator accounts that flourished on the site after a botched relaunch of its blue tick scheme for verified users. Giving more detail on the 40% figure, the Information reported that a senior Twitter manager had told staff on Tuesday that the revenue for that day was 40% lower than the same day a year ago. And in a further report on Wednesday, the Information said that Twitter’s revenue for the fourth quarter alone fell about 35%, according to details shared at an internal staff meeting. The reports came as the Financial Times reported that Twitter was due to make payments on its near-$13bn debt burden as soon as the end of this month, with Musk considering options including selling more of his shares in Tesla or even putting Twitter into bankruptcy protection. Musk sold more than $20bn worth of shares in Tesla last year to help finance the Twitter deal. He said in December that Twitter was facing a “negative cashflow situation of $3bn a year” but claimed the company should “roughly” reach cashflow break-even after cost-cutting efforts, including the departure of more than 5,000 staff. He also said last month that the company was “not on the fast lane to bankruptcy any more”, having warned in the immediate aftermath of his takeover that Twitter was in danger of going bust.

62,twitter,Guardian,2023-01-11,Sacked Twitter UK staff claim unlawful treatment in ‘sham’ redundancy ,"A group of former workers at Twitter’s UK operation have accused the company of subjecting them to “unlawful, unfair and completely unacceptable” treatment during a “sham” redundancy process. A law firm representing 43 Twitter staffers who were made redundant has raised the prospect of an employment tribunal to resolve the situation, which it says has been marred by a flawed consultation period under the company’s new owner, Elon Musk. “We consider that an employment tribunal will take an extremely dim view of the company’s failings to date, not least having regard to its size, resources and access to legal advice,” said lawyers at the British firm Winckworth Sherwood in a letter emailed to Twitter executives and seen by the Guardian. The firm said the redundancy process began for the affected employees on 18 November by treating them as if they had already been dismissed, despite a legal obligation to consult with people earmarked for losing their jobs for a minimum of 45 days. It said immediately cutting off employees from internal company systems effectively suspended them from their jobs when Twitter had no contractual right to do so. The letter added that blocking staff from accessing Twitter systems and premises made it “impossible” for employee representatives to help affected colleagues effectively. Winckworth claimed this was a breach of the 1992 Trade Union and Labour Relations Act and that an employment tribunal “would not hesitate to reach the same conclusion”. The letter also claims there was a failure to establish fair selection criteria for redundancy, which it alleges is a further breach of the act. Winckworth said the company’s cost-cutting justification for redundancies, which affected more than 180 people in the UK, was undermined by Twitter flagging “future opportunities” in London on the career section of its corporate website. The law firm said in a “significant number of instances” its clients’ jobs are not genuinely redundant. The letter says that the company claimed the postings might not be “actual adverts”. Twitter made redundant around 50% of its 7,500-strong global workforce soon after it was acquired by Musk in a $44bn (£36bn) deal. Despite this, a substantial number of employees were contacted on 23 December requiring them to respond to invitations about individual consultations on redundancy. Some had been given deadlines to accept settlement terms before their consultations, the letter alleged. “Inevitably, and perhaps intentionally, it caused much stress, anxiety and distress to those affected,” said the letter, which adds that Twitter has used the Acas arbitration service to secure settlements. Elsewhere in the letter, Twitter is accused of failing to respond to formal grievances lodged by individual workers. In the US, the company faces four class action lawsuits, and 200 legal complaints, from affected workers. Twitter has been contacted for comment.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/11/sacked-twitter-uk-staff-claim-unlawful-treatment-in-sham-redundancy
63,twitter,Guardian,2023-01-07,Twitter reportedly makes more cuts to online safety teams ,"Twitter has made more cuts to its trust and safety team in charge of international content moderation, as well as a unit overseeing hate speech and harassment, Bloomberg reported on Friday. The move adds to longstanding concerns that new owner Elon Musk is dismantling the company’s regulation of hateful content and misinformation. With Musk at the helm, Twitter has suffered a public relations crisis featuring sackings, resignations, tumbling revenues, reluctant advertisers and lawsuits over unpaid bills. The latest round of cuts affected a dozen people at Twitter’s Dublin and Singapore offices, sources who requested anonymity told Bloomberg. Among them were Analuisa Dominguez, Twitter’s senior director of revenue policy, and Nur Azhar Bin Ayob, the recently hired head of site integrity for the Asia-Pacific region. Employees in charge of Twitter’s misinformation policy, global appeals and state media were also sacked. Twitter’s head of trust and safety, Ella Irwin, confirmed to Bloomberg that several members of the teams were removed, while denying the cuts targeted other areas. “It made more sense to consolidate teams under one leader (instead of two) for example,” Irwin told Bloomberg by email, adding Twitter removed roles in areas in the company that did not have enough “volume” to warrant support. Irwin said Twitter would continue having a head of revenue policy and a head for its Asia-Pacific region for trust and safety. She also said the company increased staffing in its appeals department. Musk had been on a quest to overhaul Twitter since his $44bn (£36bn) takeover in October. The billionaire entrepreneur has outlined his vision for a “digital town square” that enshrines free speech and healthy debate. He has also claimed harmful content has declined on the platform since his acquisition. But researchers and rights advocates found slurs, hateful rhetoric and malicious content to have thrived on Twitter since Musk arrived. While banned accounts belonging to far-right reactionaries were reinstated, several prominent tech journalists found themselves briefly suspended from Twitter last month. On Friday, NBC News uncovered the existence of at least dozens of Twitter accounts offering to sell or trade child sexual exploitation materials, an issue Musk previously said he would make a priority. Last month, Reuters – citing people familiar with the matter – reported that Musk had personally ordered the removal of a feature that promoted suicide prevention resources to users who look up certain content.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/07/twitter-reportedly-makes-more-cuts-to-online-safety-teams
64,twitter,Guardian,2023-01-05,Second cabinet minister says Twitter account hacked,"A second cabinet minister has said they fell victim to hackers and was forced to apologise after their Twitter account posted a series of offensive tweets about race, sexuality and gender identity. Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, said others temporarily gained access to his account and posted some “deeply unpleasant stuff”. The tweets were deleted swiftly, and his team said they were in contact with Twitter to resolve the issue. One of the posts on Heaton-Harris’s account read: “Why are black people so poor?” Another, captured by social media users, appeared to say: “We are passing a new law soon, all transgenders and homosexuals will now serve 10 years behind bars.” Heaton-Harris sent a message to his 33,000 followers shortly afterwards. He said: “I’m afraid my Twitter account was hacked overnight and someone posted some deeply unpleasant stuff on my account for which I can only apologise.” The hack of his account will cause concern among government security officials. It follows another cabinet minister, the education secretary Gillian Keegan, also having her Twitter account hacked over Christmas. Her account was compromised for several days, and spewed out a series of tweets promoting cryptocurrencies. Keegan’s account responded to several other users’ tweets with links to a website advertising bitcoin and dogecoin. Several days later, all references to Keegan in her Twitter name, biography, photograph and banner had been removed. Issues with tech security among MPs has become a salient issue over the past few months. In November, the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, wrote to MPs advising them to boost security on their mobile phones with multi-factor verification, update software and delete old messages. The warning came after Liz Truss’s phone was reportedly hacked by Russians in the summer when she was foreign secretary and frontrunner in the Conservative party leadership race. Hoyle’s letter to MPs, which included 10 security tips, said: “You may not feel able to do everything on this list, but the more you do the less likely your personal information and mobile phone will be compromised, or the less damaging the consequences if you are hacked.” In July, the British army’s Twitter and YouTube accounts also were reportedly hacked, with posts promoting NFTs – non-fungible tokens or digital artworks – and a purported interview with Musk about cryptocurrency. Elon Musk, the under-fire owner of Twitter, has been vocal previously about his commitment to stamping out false and spam users on the social media platform.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/05/second-cabinet-minister-chris-heaton-harris-says-twitter-account-hacked
65,twitter,Guardian,2023-01-05,I’m horribly addicted to Twitter. Will Elon Musk save me from myself this year? | Joel Snape,"Where are we all going when Twitter dies? Mastodon? Hive? Back to sitting in saggy armchairs reading chunky books? Personally, I’m hoping it’s the latter, but I’m not optimistic. Twitter, of course, has been designed by a lot of very clever people to be extremely addictive, and if everyone switches to something else, it will probably be because it’s more addictive again, prodding all our dopamine-spiking buttons in some as-yet-undiscovered sequence with which battered airport paperbacks will be even less able to compete. Which, come to think of it, means it definitely won’t be Mastodon. Obviously, I’m hopelessly addicted to Twitter, like so many journalists who pretend we are using it for our jobs. I’ve tried to tie myself to the mast like Odysseus, installing apps that block it at certain hours or force me to take a cooling off period before I refresh the page, but I always find a way around them. Even if you delete your account entirely, there’s a 30-day cooling-off period, during which I inevitably re-up, like Odysseus with a pocketknife inside his tunic. Elon Musk, then, may be my only hope. Soon after his acquisition of the platform, a few waggish types suggested he might be deliberately trying to tank it – to make the public discourse less toxic, maybe, or just for the lols. Recently, that opinion has become less fashionable, but I’m clinging to it like Odysseus to a fig tree – hoping that there is some galaxy-brain plan in motion in which Musk is prepared to sacrifice his fortune and reputation to let us get back to doing something useful. Author Clay Shirky talks about “cognitive surplus”, the free mental energy we have to collaborate on projects that can be useful to humanity – and now Twitter is just a great big machine for turning all that energy into hot takes and Thanos memes. If Musk kills it, maybe his next step will be to unite us all in using that leftover thinking-space for the collective good, such as designing Mars rockets just to spite him, or something. Which would make him … Poseidon? I don’t know – I haven’t actually read the Odyssey. Joel Snape is a writer and fitness expert Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

66,twitter,Guardian,2023-01-04,Twitter to relax curbs on political ads as revenues drop,"Twitter has said it will relax restrictions on political advertising as it seeks to generate more revenue after Elon Musk’s $44bn (£36.4bn) takeover of the platform. The social media platform banned political advertising in 2019 after its then chief executive, Jack Dorsey, declared that reaching people with political messages should be “earned, not bought”. Twitter has signalled a reversal of that policy, announcing it plans to “expand the political advertising we permit in the coming weeks”. In a post on Twitter’s safety account, the company said it would align its advertising policy with that of TV broadcasters and other media outlets. The post added that Twitter would ensure, as with any policy change, “our approach to reviewing and approving content protects people on Twitter”. However, Musk has recently reinstated controversial accounts, such as those belonging to Donald Trump and Andrew Tate, despite pledging initially that such moves would be adjudicated by a “content moderation council” that has since fallen by the wayside. There will be an immediate change for restrictions on “cause-based” advertising, which it defines as ads that encourage people to take action on issues such as social inequality and economic growth. According to a Twitter advertising policy page, cause-based ads that target users in the US will no longer face restrictions such as a ban on using political terms like “conservative” or “liberal”. Advertising is Twitter’s main source of revenue, accounting for 90% of its $5.1bn turnover in 2021. However, advertisers have paused spending on Twitter after Musk’s takeover, amid fears that divisive content would mushroom on the platform, while a botched relaunch of Twitter’s subscription service also alarmed advertisers by triggering a wave of fake corporate accounts. About 70% of Twitter’s top 100 advertising clients were not spending on the platform as of mid-December, according to research firm Pathmatics.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/04/elon-musk-twitter-to-relax-restrictions-on-political-advertising-as-revenues-drop

Several users blamed Twitter’s new owner. “Hope Elon regrets firing everyone,” one said, referring to Elon Musk’s huge round of job cuts at the company after he took over. “Profile and feed not loading. Thanks Elon!” another said. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Twitter users in Australia who were able to send tweets reported the site had slowed down significantly. The issue appeared to be limited to users based in Australia and New Zealand, with some users reporting being able to use a virtual private network (VPN) to access the website as normal via the US. At the time of publication, Twitter had not acknowledged the issue. Guardian Australia attempted to seek comment from Twitter, however since Musk took over the company it no longer has a communications team. It follows a significant global outage on the desktop version of the website at the end of December. At the time, Musk tweeted that the site was working for him, that “significant backend server architecture changes” had been made and “Twitter should feel faster”. After Musk initially purchased the platform for US$44bn, and sacked approximately 50% of staff and the majority of its contractors, there had been fears that the departure of expert staff would over time lead to outages for the website. Musk has been attempting to slash costs for the business as the company will need to pay US$1bn a year in interest payments for the purchase. Late last month Musk defended the cost cuts as necessary, as the company had “a negative cash flow situation of $3 billion a year. Not good. Since Twitter has 1 billion in cash. So that’s why I spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy. “This company is like, basically, you’re in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don’t work,” Musk explained.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/04/australian-twitter-users-aim-ire-at-elon-musk-after-apparent-local-outage

69,twitter,Guardian,2023-01-01,"Slumping revenue, Tesla woes and a ‘resignation’: Musk’s wild reign at Twitter so far","When Elon Musk walked into Twitter’s offices on 26 October carrying a sink, one day before he bought the platform for $44bn (£38bn), it was the first sign that the tale of his ownership would not be a conventional one. “Let that sink in!” he tweeted. For everyone swept up in what followed – from thousands of Twitter employees to advertisers and critical journalists – it certainly has now. Musk’s reign since has proved unpredictable and controversial, with the Tesla CEO losing the title of the world’s richest man in the process. Here are some of the standout moments from those eventful past 10 weeks: Firing half the workforce As soon as Musk took over Twitter he fired senior executives including: the CEO, Parag Agrawal; Ned Segal, the chief financial officer; and Vijaya Gadde, the head of legal policy, trust and safety. Days later he axed 50% of the company’s 7,500-strong workforce with affected areas including the communications team, the curation unit that helped counter disinformation and the human rights team. More departures followed a bizarre episode in which Musk set employees a mid-November deadline to commit to working “long hours at high intensity” and being “extremely hardcore” or leave with three months’ severance pay. This led to the departure of a further 1,200 staff, according to one estimate. Musk now says Twitter has about 2,000 employees. About the same time, it was reported that Twitter had let go 4,000 contractors in fields including content moderation and engineering. Responding to predictions of Twitter’s demise in late November, Musk tweeted: “Wasn’t Twitter supposed to die by now or something … ?” However, the platform, which has faced warnings of technical problems after letting go so many expert staff, did suffer an outage on 28 December that affected some users. Musk said the firings were necessary because Twitter was losing $4m a day. That is an intimidating number for a business that must make payments of more than $1bn on the near-$13bn of debt that now sits on its balance sheet, as part of the takeover’s financing. Musk said in December that Twitter was facing a “negative cashflow situation of $3bn a year” but claimed the company should “roughly” reach cashflow break-even after his cost-cutting efforts. Alienated advertisers and subscription setbacks Musk admitted that Twitter had suffered a “massive drop in revenue” after the takeover, which he blamed on campaign groups lobbying advertisers about the future of safety and content guidelines under Musk’s leadership. The carmaker Audi, the drugs firm Pfizer and General Motors were among the brands that paused spending on the platform in the immediate wake of the takeover. This is a material issue for a company that made 90% of its more than $5bn in revenue in 2021 from advertising. The ad freeze deepened in the wake of a botched relaunch of Twitter’s premium service, Blue, which resulted in a host of impersonators taking advantage of the chances to launch “fake” verified company accounts for just $8 a month. Companies affected included the pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly &amp; Co and Musk’s own Tesla, leading to the service being temporarily suspended. Work is underway to repair the damage. Twitter is working with the World Federation of Advertisers, which says its membership represents 90% of global ad spending, on addressing advertisers’ concerns, plus Blue has been relaunched again without a resurgence of the fake account problem. The new service offers verified status – via a blue tick or checkmark – for $8 a month or $11 a month on their iPhone. Musk believes mass verification is the best way to defeat vexatious spam accounts, one of his Twitter bête noires. Other perks promised by the subscription service include an edit button, a 50% reduction in the number of adverts in a user’s feed and the ability to post longer tweets. Reinstating banned accounts Musk has lifted suspensions on the accounts operated by Donald Trump, the British-American former kickboxer Andrew Tate – who had been banned for extreme misogynist posts, and was on Friday arrested in Romania on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming an organised crime group – and the Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson, among others. The account of US rapper Ye – formerly Kanye West – was also reinstated but then suspended again after he tweeted an image of a swastika blended with a star of David. At the same time Musk announced a new content policy of “freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach”, stating that “negative/hate” tweets would be “deboosted” and no adverts would appear near them. The reinstatements were another sign of the inconsistent behaviour that would mark Musk’s reign, coming weeks after he said no decisions would be taken on reinstatement until a newly announced “content moderation council” had met. He blamed the apparent backtrack on unnamed “political/social activist groups”, accusing them of persuading advertisers to stay away. Suspending journalists In mid-December Musk contradicted his stance on freedom of speech by freezing the accounts of prominent tech journalists at CNN, the Washington Post, Mashable and the New York Times. He accused them of breaching a newly created Twitter guideline that barred users from publishing “live location information” that would “reveal a person’s location, regardless if this information is publicly available”. This guideline had been created as an apparent justification for suspending, @ElonJet, a Twitter account that had long vexed Musk by displaying the location of his private jet via publicly available information. The journalists were reinstated days later, after Musk launched a poll on his own Twitter account that delivered a majority in favour of lifting the suspensions. But Musk’s targeting of journalists drew condemnation from the UN, the EU and campaign groups. Also in December, Musk released internal Twitter documents to select journalists in a project dubbed the “Twitter Files”. The documents showed the internal process behind decisions to suspend Donald Trump’s account in 2021 and the platform’s response to the Hunter Biden laptop story. Another excerpt from the files raised questions about Twitter’s dealings with the Pentagon. Dragging Tesla into it Musk’s status as Tesla CEO is key to his fortune and had made him the richest person on the planet, before he lost the title to the luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault in December. The performance of the electric carmaker, in which Musk holds a substantial stake, has got worse as his interest in Twitter has grown. Musk’s involvement in the platform first emerged in early April with the revelation that he held a large shareholding in the business, followed weeks later by the deal to buy the company, which he initially walked away from – leading to legal action – before he returned to complete it two months ago. In 2022, Tesla’s shares declined in value by 70% to $123. Some of this is Tesla-specific, such as slowing demand and fears over Covid shutdowns at its Chinese factories, but Musk’s repeated sales of Tesla stock to fund his Twitter purchase – despite saying in April he had no more planned – plus concerns that he is focusing too much on the social media platform have also rattled investors. “Musk has lost credibility with the broader investment community as broken promises (selling stock again and again and again ….), the Twitter fiasco, opening up the political firestorm on Twitter, and brand deterioration for Musk and Tesla has led to a complete debacle for the stock,” said Dan Ives, the managing director at the financial services firm Wedbush Securities. “Resigning” as boss Musk said on 20 December he would resign as the CEO of Twitter “as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!” His announcement followed a poll on his Twitter account in which users voted decisively in favour of him standing down. The pledge also followed court testimony in November in which he said he expected to “reduce my time at Twitter” after an “initial burst of activity”. Whoever takes the job will be running a globally influential social media platform with more than 250 million daily users. But with a very demanding, and impulsive, owner. “One of the first things I said after the acquisition closed was like, ‘we’re gonna make a bunch of mistakes but then we’ll try to recover from them quickly,’ and that’s what we’ve done,” Musk said on the All-In Podcast, released days after his announcement he was stepping down. But for the Tesla CEO, the biggest mistake – with a lower chance of full recovery – might have been buying Twitter in the first place.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/01/revenue-tesla-elon-musks-twitter-staff-investors
70,twitter,Guardian,2023-01-01,Andrew Tate arrest: TikTok and Twitter under fire over false posts from fans,"Social media firms are under fire this weekend for allowing the spread of misinformation by followers of “king of toxic masculinity” Andrew Tate after his arrest in connection with a human trafficking investigation. In the hours after his detention, TikTok and Twitter were flooded with posts falsely claiming he had been freed and conspiracy theories saying he had been set up, Observer analysis shows. Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said: “Having conspiracy theories proliferating which might put at risk the integrity of an investigation or the safety of those involved is unconscionable.” Tate, 36, a British-American internet personality best known for his misogynistic views, was arrested with his brother Tristan in Romania on 29 December as part of an investigation into human trafficking, rape and organised crime. An investigation by the Observer in August into the former kickboxer and Big Brother contestant revealed that TikTok was aggressively promoting his content to users including boys and young men. Members of Tate’s online academy had been instructed to post deliberately controversial clips in an effort to boost engagement and manipulate the algorithm. After his arrest last week, a statement from prosecutors said four people, including two Britons, were suspected of being part of a criminal group that sexually exploited women after luring them with promises of a relationship. The women were allegedly subjected to “physical violence and mental coercion through intimidation, constant surveillance, control and invoking alleged debts” and forced to make pornographic videos. Six potential victims had been identified. Further details of the specific allegations against Tate have not been made public. On Friday, it was confirmed that he would spend the next 30 days in detention as Romania’s Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism continues its inquiries. On social media, thousands of supporters have already reached their verdict. On TikTok and Twitter, Tate’s fans claimed without evidence that he had been framed, using hashtags such as #freetopG and #tateinnocent. “People lie because they hate Tate,” one wrote on Twitter. “I’m 100% sure Tate is innocent. FREE TATE,” said another. Others blamed “the Matrix” for setting him up. This was fuelled by Tate himself in a tweet posted after news of his arrest: “The Matrix sent their agents,” he wrote on Friday. Since the release of the 1999 sci-fi film about people living in a simulation, where a man is given the choice to take a red pill and “wake up”, the metaphor has been repeatedly repurposed in a range of conspiracy theories, as well by fringe online groups who use “redpill” to mean men waking up to the “reality” that feminism subjugates them. On TikTok on Friday, the most-liked recent video about Tate was one that appeared at first to be a factual report but ended by asking viewers: “What do you guys think is the real reason Tate was arrested? Was it the Matrix, or did Tate actually commit a serious crime?” On Twitter, where Tate has more than 4m followers after his account was reinstated in November, many posts referenced #Pizzagate – a debunked theory that predated QAnon and claimed senior Democrats were behind a child sexual abuse ring – and suggested he was being used as a scapegoat by real paedophile rings. In a video made shortly before his arrest, after a Twitter spat with the climate activist Greta Thunberg, Tate had appeared on camera with a pizza box in front of him in what some speculated was a reference to the conspiracy. “They want to cover up Pizzagate with Andrew Tate,” one Twitter user wrote, tagging Elon Musk. Other accounts posted old videos suggesting Tate had been cleared, despite him remaining in detention. One clip viewed 780,000 times on Twitter by Saturday claimed to show him being freed from custody. “Andrew Tate got Released Matrix attack Failed,” the caption read. The fierce defence of Tate and spread of misinformation since his arrest will add to concerns about the impact on any future legal proceedings and raise questions for the social media platforms that helped propel him to the mainstream. In the weeks after the Observer’s August investigation, TikTok banned Tate’s official account and said it took a tough stance on hateful content including misogyny. On Saturday night, TikTok said it had begun a systematic review of content flagged with it and would remove any that violated its guidelines, which ban “misinformation that causes significant harm to individuals, our community, or the larger public”. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jan/01/fans-andrew-tate-king-of-toxic-masculinity-flood-web-arrest
71,twitter,Guardian,2023-01-01,The Twitter Files should disturb liberal critics of Elon Musk – and here’s why | Kenan Malik,"Half the room is jumping up and down, screaming “Gotcha!”. The other half shrugs its shoulders, muttering “So what’s new?”. Welcome to the war over the so-called Twitter Files. Over the past month, Twitter’s new owner, Elon Musk, has made available to a handpicked group of journalists internal documents and conversations that took place before his takeover. They are mainly discussions about who and what should be moderated or banned, ranging from the Hunter Biden laptop story to the question of whether to remove Donald Trump from the platform. The journalists have made public selected slices of the data through a drip feed of Twitter threads. For some, the Twitter Files provide evidence of collusion between tech companies, liberal politicians and the “deep state” to silence conservatives. For others, they constitute little more than a publicity exercise that told us nothing that we did not know. As someone who has long made a case for the importance of free speech, I think we should take the Twitter Files seriously, but also look at the discussion with a sceptical eye, given that much of it is framed by the culture wars. Consider the controversy over “shadow banning”. It’s a phrase much bandied about in debates about social media, but its meaning is contested. For the curators of the Twitter Files, “shadow banning” means using algorithms to “deamplify” tweets – that is, stop them reaching a wider audience. For the old pre-Musk Twitter, however, it meant something different – “deliberately making someone’s content undiscoverable to everyone except the person who posted it”, as a 2018 blog post put it. The conflicting definitions have allowed the critics to accuse former Twitter executives of lying, although they seem as interested in putting the old Twitter regime in the dock as in uncovering the truth. The journalists curating the Twitter Files have presented deamplification as a secret process. Certainly, the internal mechanisms of moderation have been veiled in secrecy. As a practice, however, Twitter has long been open about deamplification – or “visibility filtering” as it also calls it – noting even in its terms of service that “we may… limit distribution or visibility of any Content”. It’s a practice championed not just by old Twitter but new Twitter, too. Shortly after buying the platform, Musk tweeted that his policy would be one of “freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach”, adding that “negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted” – in other words, deamplified. But is it a good policy? Who decides who or what should be “deamplified”? By what criteria? And how different is this from straightforward censorship? Unfortunately, the polarisation of the debate seems to have overridden a nuanced debate around such questions. The Twitter Files also reveal some of the processes by which users are banned. Twitter insists that it does not suspend accounts for “political reasons”. That’s hard to square with the evidence. Take the controversy over Trump. Twitter executives held anguished discussions about how to deal with the president, recognising the dangers of banning a democratically elected leader. Nevertheless, as one executive put it, “the narrative that trump [sic] and his friends have pursued over the course of this election and frankly last 4+ years must be taken into account”. In other words, Trump’s politics mattered. After the 6 January riot at the Capitol, the pressure that Twitter faced led to the second argument taking precedence over the first. All this has strengthened the view on the right of tech companies as fomenting a liberal conspiracy against conservatives. Within Twitter, Musk tweeted, “rules were enforced against the right, but not against the left”. Yet a 2021 study suggested the opposite. Looking at millions of tweets in seven countries – Britain, America, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and Japan – researchers found that, with the exception of Germany, Twitter algorithms amplified rightwing politicians more than the left. They also found that in America, conservative news sources were boosted more than liberal ones. These results cut against the grain of conventional wisdom. It may be that there’s a sharp divide between algorithmic decisions and those made by human moderators. It may also be that the high-profile censoring of rightwing voices is not representative of the mass of decisions. In the last six months of 2021 alone, Twitter censored an extraordinary 4m tweets – a figure that itself should give us pause. The political bias in those 4m decisions is unknown. There is little discussion, for instance, about the suppression of Palestinian voices, a practice that has continued under Musk. At the very least, we need more transparency about moderation. Yet, when Alex Stamos, of Stanford University’s Internet Observatory, asked Musk to allow not just handpicked journalists but academic researchers to inspect the data, Musk dismissed him on the bizarre grounds that “you operate a propaganda platform”. Musk seems more interested in being seen to “own the libs” than in opening up Twitter’s inner workings. The most worrying issue the Twitter Files have exposed is the level of contact between the social media company and state security organisations. The FBI regularly holds meetings with Twitter executives, pressuring them to take action against “misinformation”, even when this amounted to little more than a satirical tweet, and demanding the personal data of users. Twitter, to its credit, often pushed back. Nevertheless, the Twitter Files do show an unhealthy relationship between social media and state security. Equally unhealthy is the response of many liberals who have become sanguine about the work of the security apparatus. There has been a remarkable partisan shift in American attitudes towards the FBI, with a huge swing in Democratic support for the organisation. Many now view the FBI as an essential weapon against populism. Many seem to have forgotten the sordid history of the FBI in undermining radical movements from unions to civil rights organisations. The insouciance of liberals and many on the left to such state interference in public life is disquieting. Twitter, we are constantly told, is not real life. That’s true. But, like all social media, it plays an inordinately large role in real life, a private company that has become an intimate part of the global public square. We need to keep that public square as open as possible. That is why the revelations of the Twitter Files matter. And that is why we need to understand their significance beyond the clamour of the culture wars. Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

72,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-30,"‘I’m not afraid any more’: Christie Whelan Browne on Show People, Twitter trolls and her ‘horrible’ four years","Christie Whelan Browne cheerfully admits she’ll hit her “ageing diva phase” any minute now. The Melbourne-based actor recently turned 40 and is at near-exhaustion point when we meet, juggling a new sketch comedy TV series, a solo stage show for Sydney festival and grabbing a few moments on FaceTime with her almost two-year-old son Duke. “He doesn’t understand that I’m away, he’s too little,” Whelan Browne says. “For me it’s a new level of heartbreak. I was an absolute wreck the first week away from him.” Whelan Browne is sitting on the edge of a bed in her temporary digs in Newtown, Sydney, at the end of what has already been a long day. Immaculately groomed after a photoshoot, she veers from confident to cautious in the media spotlight, after the “ugliest, most horrible four years” of her life. Best known for her work on the stage, Whelan Browne has delighted audiences with her whip-sharp timing in Muriel’s Wedding the Musical, Shakespeare’s As You Like It and Oscar Wilde’s An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest. On the small screen, she’s starred in Shaun Micallef’s Mad as Hell and has just wrapped We Interrupt This Broadcast, a new Channel 7 comedy for 2023. She describes herself as a comic actor. “I feel confident in my ability to make people laugh,” she says, adding that her solo Sydney festival piece Show People – which premiered at Adelaide cabaret festival (under a different name, Pure Blonde) in 2015 – is “tragic and hilarious”. Performing it comes as a welcome change of gear after four years of intense media coverage that overshadowed her talent. In 2018, Whelan Browne, along with two other female cast members, brought forward allegations of indecent assault against Craig McLachlan, the star of their 2014 production of the Rocky Horror Picture Show. McLachlan denied the allegations. In 2020, a criminal trial found him not guilty, and in 2021 he brought a defamation case against Whelan Browne, the ABC and Nine, before dropping the suit in May of 2022. Those were dark times, Whelan Browne recalls. She received death threats and rape threats. “That really shocked me,” she says. “I copped anger and hatred from the media and the public and I just wasn’t prepared for that.” The end of the court case left her feeling “a bit like a zombie”. “The next day, my son woke up at six, and life just carried on. I was back at work the next day or the day after,” she says. “It wasn’t until just a few weeks ago that I finally realised there is this big heavy monkey on my back and that I’m going to need to address it at some point.” Whelan Browne says she lost work during this time and was fired from one job after she was sued for defamation. “That was very painful,” she says. “But I made it my mission to continue working, to make it clear I wasn’t broken or beaten.” Twice during our interview she wipes away a tear, but she doesn’t want it misinterpreted: “I’m only crying because I’m so very tired. Please don’t make it a sad story – because I’m not.” Whelan Browne is now a powerful vocal ally on Twitter for women who have experienced sexual assault. “I know what it meant to me when people were willing to put their face and voice to a supportive comment, when others shied away because they knew it would provoke the trolls,” she says. “But I’m not afraid any more. I would prefer to be someone who uses their voice. I am never going to be quiet any more.” She is still being trolled on Twitter too, she says. When it happens, she writes “Fuckhead alert” to warn other women. “I don’t want women to feel they’ve got no hope or that they’re alone. I get people reaching out in my DMs asking how best to navigate the shitty situations women find themselves in. I don’t really know what I can do other than calling out injustice when you see it.” There’s a long way to go, but Whelan Browne says she’s inspired by the younger generation of female performers who “will not take the shit other generations have taken – they just won’t,” she says. “The young women I worked with on Muriel’s Wedding were amazing at calling out anything they didn’t like. They are far better at pointing it out and saying, ‘That needs to stop’, and that gives me so much hope for the future. They just don’t have that same fear that I definitely grew up with, and that makes me so happy.” Show People predates her experiences on Rocky Horror. It began in 2015 when Barry Humphries invited Whelan Browne to create a show for the Adelaide cabaret festival, after her hit Britney Spears cabaret written by her collaborator and friend Dean Bryant. Bryant also wrote and directed Show People, in which Whelan Browne plays six roles: a new drama school graduate; a mum juggling performing and childcare; an ageing diva; an understudy; an older actor ready to retire, and the misogynistic leading man. “I was nervous to perform the show at first, knowing people would be wondering who the characters could be based on,” she says. “But the truth is, they are all of us. I have been at least three of the characters myself and I will probably be more. They’ve all faced obstacles along the way.” The careworn actor-mum has special resonance these days, she says. Whelan Browne was performing nightly in a play when Duke was only eight months old. She missed bath and bedtime terribly. “I thought, ‘That’s it, I can’t do theatre any more.’ I think my time in that world might be done for a while. “In my 20s and 30s I was striving for a career but now happiness is my goal. Happiness and less stress. A toddler helps with that a lot. When you are stopping to look at flowers at every single house along the way to the park and a 10-minute walk takes 40 minutes, that’s when you realise how much beauty we miss in our busy lives.” Show People plays at Sydney festival on 12 January",https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/dec/31/im-not-afraid-any-more-christie-whelan-browne-on-show-people-twitter-trolls-and-her-horrible-four-years
73,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-29,Twitter outage: Elon Musk says ‘works for me’ as users report problems with website,"Twitter users have reported a massive global outage with many unable to access the website and its features for hours. According to downdetector.com, which tracks site traffic, the website became unavailable shortly before midnight GMT (11am Thursday AEDT, 7pm Wednesday EST), with outages most commonly reported on website rather than the app. Within an hour, the website had recorded more than 10,000 user reports of problems accessing Twitter. The London-based internet monitor NetBlocks said “Twitter is experiencing international outages affecting the mobile app and features including notifications”. “The incident is not related to country-level internet disruptions or filtering.” Many users were still able to use the platform, while others were met with an error message that read “something went wrong, but don’t fret – it’s not your fault”. One user in Ireland reported “difficulties logging into Twitter tonight … I’m supposed to be asleep but now I’m watching news stories on the global twitter crash”. Elon Musk, who bought Twitter for $44bn in October, responded to users reporting problems by tweeting “works for me”. Hours later, Musk tweeted that “significant backend server architecture changes” had been made and that “Twitter should feel faster”. Concerns about longer and more regular outages increased when Twitter slashed, by some estimates, up to half of its workforce with little notice under Musk’s tenure. About 50 percent of Twitter’s 7,500 staff were sacked in Musk’s first week. In his second week, about four in five of the firm’s 5,500 contractors were released. The mass layoffs reportedly gutted teams that cover human rights, machine learning ethics, curation, communications and accessibility. In July, before the job losses, Twitter experienced one of its longest outages for years, with the social network unavailable to users on web and mobile for almost an hour. Earlier this month, Musk confirmed he would step down as chief executive once a suitable replacement was found, citing the company’s finances as a reason to delay his promised departure.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/29/twitter-users-report-global-outage-with-many-unable-to-log-into-website-or-app
74,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-28,Mastodon founder says investors lining up since Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover,"The founder of Mastodon has said he has rejected approaches from more than five US-based investors, as the Twitter rival grows in popularity after Elon Musk’s chaotic debut as a social media owner. Eugen Rochko, who launched the open-source social network in 2016, told the Financial Times he had received the offers from Silicon Valley private equity firms to put “hundreds of thousands of dollars” into the product. The popularity of Mastodon has surged since the $44bn acquisition of Twitter by Musk in October. Rochko said last week that Mastodon had jumped from 300,000 monthly active users to 2.5 million after the Twitter deal, which has seen Musk reinstate banned accounts such as Donald Trump’s and temporarily suspend journalists at publications including the New York Times and Washington Post. Rochko, a German software developer, told the FT his platform’s status as a non-profit organisation was “untouchable” and its independence was part of its appeal to users. Mastodon has more than 9,200 patrons on Patreon, the online membership service, who are contributing more than £28,000 a month to the platform between them. “Mastodon will not turn into everything you hate about Twitter,” he said. “The fact that it can be sold to a controversial billionaire, the fact that it can be shut down, go bankrupt and so on. It’s the difference in paradigms [between the platforms].” Mastodon was dragged into Musk’s controversial approach to moderation on Twitter this month, after its own Twitter account was suspended for sharing a link to the Mastodon account of @elonjet, an account that Musk had suspended for showing the location of his private jet. Musk also briefly banned all links to Mastodon and suspended users who tweeted their Mastodon usernames. In a blog post, Rochko wrote: “This is a stark reminder that centralised platforms can impose arbitrary and unfair limits on what you can and can’t say … At Mastodon, we believe that there doesn’t have to be a middleman between you and your audience and that journalists and government institutions especially should not have to rely on a private platform to reach the public.” Mastodon is made up of “instances”, or decentralised servers. Two of the most popular instances are run by Rochko, with many smaller ones operated by hobbyists. Once a user has joined an instance, they can communicate with users on others.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/28/mastodon-founder-elon-musk-twitter-takeover
75,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-28,Cybersecurity firm links Piers Morgan Twitter hack to leak of 400m records ,"The former Australian prime minister Scott Morrison appears to have been caught up in a leak of partial data on 400 million Twitter users, along with celebrities including the model Cara Delevingne, US politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and pop singer Shawn Mendes. Morrison’s Twitter account was included in a sample of data released by an alleged cybercriminal last week. The cybersecurity firm that alerted the public to the apparent hacker’s claim said it was “likely not a coincidence” that media personality Piers Morgan, who also appeared in data samples published by the hacker, has just had his Twitter account hacked. Most of Morgan’s Twitter account content had been wiped, but according to reports, it had sent out slurs and abusive messages directed at the late Queen and at UK singer Ed Sheeran. Only Morrison’s official email address, which was already publicly accessible, was mentioned as being included in the hack, and his phone number was also not listed, which may limit any potential harm. The hacker claimed the data had been “scraped” from Twitter via a “vulnerability” in the site, and “includes emails and phone numbers of celebrities, politicians, companies, normal users, and a lot of OG and special usernames”. The hacker offered data for sale “exclusively” to Twitter for US$200,000 (A$300,000) in order for the company to avoid paying EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) fines. The Guardian has decided not to name the site. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In August, Twitter admitted that a vulnerability in its API systems identified in January had allowed people to discover what, if any Twitter account was associated with a phone number or email address. By exploiting the vulnerability, people could patch together a data record of both public and private information – such as the private phone numbers and emails of high profile users. The bug was caused by an update to Twitter’s code in June 2021. It was patched once identified, but in July 2022, Twitter learned “a bad actor had taken advantage of the issue before it was addressed”. That came after someone attempted to sell the email addresses and phone numbers of 5.4 million users. Twitter said it would alert users confirmed to have been affected by the breach. Those details were released in November, with reports at the time it could be the tip of the iceberg and no one able to confirm for sure how many users had been caught up by people exploiting the flaw. Israeli cyber-intelligence firm Hudson Rock appeared to be among the first to notice the posting offering the data of 400 million Twitter users, tweeting about the “credible threat” three days ago. So far, no one has independently verified that the poster has access to what they claim.

The former Good Morning Britain (GMB) presenter, 57, who has 8.3 million followers on the social media site, had no profile picture, banner image or posts on Tuesday afternoon. Some tweets containing still and video images remained, as did records of tweets his account had liked. According to reports, his account shared posts overnight containing false information, racial slurs and abusive messages directed at the late Queen Elizabeth II and the singer Ed Sheeran. It comes after the account of the UK education secretary, Gillian Keegan, appeared to be hacked on Christmas Day. Her account replied to several tweets with links to websites advertising cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. The tweets on Keegan’s account began appearing shortly before 7.30pm on Christmas Day, and were sent throughout the evening into the early hours on Boxing Day. Last month the Commons speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, wrote to MPs advising them to ramp up security on their mobile phones with multi-factor verification, as well as update software and delete old messages. The warning came after Liz Truss’s phone was reportedly hacked by Russians in the summer when she was foreign secretary and frontrunner in the Tory leadership race. Morgan’s Instagram account appeared to be operating normally. The presenter, who recently joined TalkTV as the host of its Uncensored show after quitting GMB, has not publicly addressed the apparent hack. Earlier this month, the Metropolitan police said no further action would be taken against a man suspected of sending death threats to Morgan and his family online. On Twitter, Morgan complained there was a “big problem with how big tech operates its safety procedures”. A spokesperson for TalkTV declined to comment.

The profile picture was changed to one showing Elon Musk and several tweets were posted promoting a cryptocurrency event. On Christmas Day the account of Gillian Keegan, the MP for Chichester, replied to a number of tweets with links to a website advertising cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and dogecoin. On Sunday evening the account posted a spate of tweets, suggesting the security had been compromised. By Monday all reference to Keegan in her Twitter name, her biography, photograph and banner had been removed. In a tweet reply to YouTuber MrBeast, Keegan’s account posted: “Don’t let it get away! It’s gonna be awesome!” It was accompanied by a link purporting to advertise a “giveaway” for the “crypto community”. In a reply to a tweet by Musk, the new owner of Twitter, words on the account said: “Thank you for another great year! This feels a lot like Christmas. Don’t miss guys!! BREAKING NEWS 4 Christmas.” In other tweets the account described people who own the cryptocurrency dogecoin, once backed by Musk, as “a #dogecoin warrior fighting for the future!” The cryptocurrency, which launched as a joke in 2013, soared in value earlier this year after Musk promoted it by saying it could be used to buy Tesla merchandise.

The feature, known as #ThereIsHelp, placed a banner at the top of search results for certain topics and listed contacts for organisations in numerous countries related to mental health, HIV, vaccines, child sexual exploitation, Covid-19, gender-based violence, natural disasters and freedom of expression. Reuters reported on Friday that the feature was taken down a few days ago. Twitter’s head of trust and safety, Ella Irwin, confirmed the removal and called it temporary. Irwin said: “We have been fixing and revamping our prompts. They were just temporarily removed while we do that. We expect to have them back up next week.” Irwin said: “Google does really well with these in their search results and [we] are actually mirroring some of their approach with the changes we are making.” She added: “We know these prompts are useful in many cases and just want to make sure they are functioning properly and continue to be relevant.” Musk, who did not initially respond to requests for comment about the removal, had tweeted: “False, it is still there.” In response to criticism by Twitter users, the billionaire also wrote that “Twitter doesn’t prevent suicide.” The initial removal had led some consumer safety groups and Twitter users to express concerns about the wellbeing of vulnerable users on the platform. Eirliani Abdul Rahman, who had been on a recently dissolved Twitter content advisory group, said the disappearance of #ThereIsHelp was “extremely disconcerting and profoundly disturbing”. She added even if it was only temporarily removed to make way for improvements, “normally you would be working on it in parallel, not removing it”. Musk has previously said that impressions, or views, of harmful content are declining since he took over the company in October and has tweeted graphs showing a downward trend, even as researchers and civil rights groups have tracked an increase in tweets with racial slurs and other hateful content. The entrepreneur has also declared he wants to combat child abuse imagery on Twitter and has criticised the previous ownership’s handling of the issue. But he has reduced large portions of the teams involved in dealing with potentially objectionable material. Twitter had launched some prompts about five years ago and some had been available in over 30 countries, according to company tweets. In one of its blog posts about the #ThereIsHelp feature, Twitter had said it had responsibility to ensure users could “access and receive support on our service when they need it most”. Just as Musk bought the company, the feature was expanded to show information related to natural disaster searches in Indonesia and Malaysia.

79,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-24,Twitter restores suicide-prevention hotline feature after outcry,"Twitter has restored a feature that promoted suicide prevention hotlines and other safety resources to users looking up certain content, after coming under pressure from users and consumer safety groups. The feature, known as #ThereIsHelp, placed a banner at the top of search results for certain topics, listing contacts for support organizations in many countries related to mental health, HIV, vaccines, child sexual exploitation, Covid-19, gender-based violence, natural disasters and freedom of expression. Reuters said on Friday the feature had been taken down this week. Citing two people familiar with the matter, the report said the removal was ordered by the social media platform’s owner, Elon Musk. After publication of the story, Twitter’s head of trust and safety, Ella Irwin, confirmed the removal but said it was temporary. “We have been fixing and revamping our prompts. They were just temporarily removed while we do that,” Irwin said in an email to Reuters. Musk then denied the feature had been removed, and called the Reuters report “fake news”. Nonetheless, the report appeared at the start of the Christmas holiday, a fraught time for many, prompting widespread concern. The anonymous sources cited by Reuters said millions had encountered #ThereIsHelp messages on Twitter. Eirliani Abdul Rahman, a member of a recently dissolved Twitter content advisory group, told Reuters the disappearance of #ThereIsHelp was “extremely disconcerting and profoundly disturbing” even if the removal had been implemented to make way for improvements. “This is the worst time of the year to remove the suicide prevention feature,” wrote Jane Manchun Wong, a software developer and Twitter user. “Instead of leaving a time gap without suicide prevention feature for a revamp, they could’ve kept the old prompt and replaced it with a new one when it’s ready.” Early on Saturday, Musk responded, tweeting: “1. The message is actually still up. This is fake news. 2. Twitter doesn’t prevent suicide.” Online services including Twitter, Google and Facebook have for years tried to direct users to resources such as government hotlines if they suspect a user may be in danger. Irwin said Twitter planned to adopt an approach used by Google. That platform, she said, “does really well with these in their search results, and [we] are actually mirroring some of their approach with the changes we are making. “We know these prompts are useful in many cases and just want to make sure they are functioning properly and continue to be relevant.” Musk has said views of harmful content on Twitter have declined since he took over in October. Then, he said, “almost no one” at Twitter was working on child safety. “I made it top priority immediately,” he added. But Musk has reduced teams involved in dealing with difficult material and observers have said self-harm content is thriving, despite an apparent ban. Twitter launched the warning prompts about five years ago. Some were available in more than 30 countries, according to company tweets. In a blogpost, Twitter said it was responsible for ensuring users could “access and receive support on our service when they need it most”. Alex Goldenberg, lead intelligence analyst at the non-profit Network Contagion Research Institute, said his group published a study in August – before Musk took control of Twitter – showing that monthly Twitter mentions of terms associated with self-harm had increased by over 500% year on year, particularly among young users. “If this decision is emblematic of a policy change that they no longer take these issues seriously, that’s extraordinarily dangerous,” Goldenberg told Reuters. “It runs counter to Musk’s previous commitments to prioritize child safety.” In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is at 800-273-8255 and online chat is also available. You can also text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis text line counselor. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

80,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-22,Socials club:best Insta and Twitter accounts capturing UK nightlife,"Nightlife is an ephemeral thing. For all the joy and chaos of a big night out, our memories are often left behind on sticky dancefloors, bulldozed by hangovers or washed down the drain the following morning along with the sweat and the makeup. In the cold light of day warehouses converted into illicit dancefloors return to anonymous industrial sites, and in recent years the UK’s bars and clubs have faced the triple-pronged threat of the pandemic, the cost of living crisis and the relentless Pret-ification of high streets. This is what makes photographs of nightlife culture so mesmeric, and so important: they record for posterity the fleeting magic and mayhem of temporary scenes. The following archives and photographers help document the many fabulous and debauched faces of the UK’s clubs, pubs, raves and DIY venues, providing a window to generations of party animals. Linden Archives – Instagram Bored during lockdown, Stuart Linden Rhodes began uploading some of the thousands of photographs he’d taken of the gay scene in northern England in the 1990s on to his Instagram account. Rhodes started out as a nightlife photographer for All Points North magazine (terrible pay, but he got free entry to clubs), and later worked as the northern correspondent for Gay Times. By night, he travelled to venues across the country, photographing gay bars, Pride events and club nights, as well as the occasional celebrity. Lily Savage, the drag persona of Paul O’Grady, Julian Clary and young, Lycra-clad members of Take That can be found among the revellers. By day, Rhodes was a teacher in Harrogate. “It was madness,” he says of his moonlighting. “I would get back to Harrogate, and the first thing I had to do for the Gay Times was pop the films in a jiffy bag, go to the post office at the railway station and deposit the film so it could get on the first train to London. Then I’d go home, go to bed and go to work.” Because this was the era of Section 28 – the homophobic law brought in by Margaret Thatcher’s government that pushed countless staff and students into the closet – Rhodes used his middle name, Linden, for his photography work. But his colleagues in the staff room knew about his second career. “I used to take the mickey by saying that they were going home to do their gardening and play with train sets. There I was loading up the car with cameras and friends and heading off into the night.” Rhodes stopped photographing the club scene in the 2000s. By then the “drug culture had taken hold”, and the music had got too intense for his tastes. (Too much hardcore, not enough Donna Summer.) These days he posts a new photograph on @linden_archives every day, and the account has become a kind of collective photo album, where followers can take a trip down memory lane and comment on people and places they recognise. Out and About with Linden, a queer archive of the north, will be republished in 2023 by Pariah Press. Museum of Youth Culture – Instagram The Museum of Youth Culture has a similar nostalgic appeal, collecting photographs of people in Britain between the ages of 15 and 25 taken over the past 100 years, and inviting the public to send in their snaps. Among the submissions are fuzzy photos of raucous pre-drinks at home, women smoking cigs in social clubs, house parties in Manchester and pints and hairspray in Essex nightclubs. Originally a photo archive, the project was established in 1997 by Jon Swinstead, co-founder of the 90s fashion magazine Sleazenation. Unimpressed by the corny stock images of youth subcultures, he created the Photographic Youth Music Culture Archive (PYMCA), working with photographers to build a bank of images that he licensed to newspapers and magazines. In 2015, realising the potential of the collection as a public archive, the agency was relaunched as the Museum of Youth Culture. Today the museum is nomadic, popping up in different locations across the UK. A current exhibition at Coventry’s Herbert Art Gallery includes a scanning station where visitors can add their photos. Its Instagram account @museumofyouthculture, which combines the work of professional and amateur photographers, is a treasure trove of big looks and big nights out through the decades. There are photos of groovers on the soul scene, raven-haired goths at Soho’s legendary Batcave club, pilled-up ravers with dummies and whistles round their necks and boozy nu-metal fans looking knackered post-mosh. Grown Up in Britain: 100 Years of Teenage Kicks is at the Coventry Herbert Art Gallery &amp; Museum to 12 February. Liz Johnson Artur – Instagram Born in Bulgaria, celebrated chronicler of Black British culture Liz Johnson Artur has been documenting nightlife since she arrived in London in the early 1990s, photographing MC battles, teenage raves, Notting Hill carnival and ad-hoc club nights. In the 2000s, she started following the clandestine instructions issued by London’s pirate radio stations for getting to illegal parties. “We’d meet a man at a garage and he’d take us to some backstreets or up some roof,” she says of adventures that eventually led to a dancefloor. Part of the appeal of Artur’s photographs is their generosity. She always shows her subjects in a positive light: relaxed, part of a community, living their best lives. When I ask if she has a strategy for putting people at ease, she says there is no technique, only trust. “In a club, people are in a place where they feel safe enough to let go, and there has to be an understanding. If people allow me in, I’m happy to take what they give me.” Artur describes herself as old-fashioned and dedicated to the craft of manual photography. (She still uses one of the cameras she had upon arrival in the UK.) Her daughter helps with her Instagram account, @lizjohnsonartur, where you can see photographs from Artur’s formidable back catalogue alongside recent glitzier photos of Black celebrities such as Marcus Rashford and Michaela Coel. Works by Liz Johnson Artur make up one of the 13 displays of the ongoing Artist and Society exhibition, showing at Tate Modern, London. Chaotic Nightclub Photos – Twitter Pictures of the past often slip us into the warm bath of nostalgia – it seems easier to mythologise and cannibalise days gone by than it does to look the present in the eye. For readers wanting a distinctly unromantic view of recent British nightlife, Chaotic Nightclub Photos (@ClubPhotos) is the place for you. The Twitter account specialises in images of the kind of debauched and disgraceful goings-on you might expect to find in the corner of a Hieronymus Bosch painting: a man taking a secret wee while ordering a drink at a bar; someone projectile vomiting in the background of a group photo; a person passed out in the trough of a urinal; a woman attempting to swallow her own fist; police peeling people off the pavement after closing. Since it launched earlier this year, Chaotic Nightclub Photos has amassed more than 1 million followers. While the photos have no explanatory captions, and some appear to come from international clubs, other destinations are recognisable by the watermark logos of venues around the UK, suggesting they’ve been taken by in-house photographers. The images record the sloppy carnage familiar to every nightclub in every town and on every university campus, and the perverse joy of looking is only tempered by the fear of finding yourself in the background, pissed as a fart and doing something utterly regrettable. Dirty Little Club Babe – Instagram As a teenager in Hackney in the 2000s, Roxy Lee began taking pictures in order to remember nights out. The capital’s squat-party scene has a long and anarchic history of turning boarded-up pubs, warehouses, office blocks and other abandoned buildings into improvised venues. Squat parties, Lee says, “were always such temporary spaces. I’m a very precious person, I’m a bit of a hoarder. I’m like that with my memories as well.” Eight years ago, when Lee was in her early 20s, she turned her lens on London’s queer scene. Her desire to keep a record of her social life was strengthened by the ongoing closures of many much-loved pubs and clubs: over the last decade, 60% of London’s queer venues have closed, in part due to soaring rents and rampant property development. The photos Lee posts on her Insta account @sausageandcustard are a riot of ripped fishnets, mirrorballs, jockstraps, outrageous outfits, poppers and drag queens, and an irreverent celebration of the hedonism and creativity that continues to flourish in spite of punitive economic conditions. What makes a good picture of a night out? “Sexiness, in the broadest meaning of the term,” says Lee. “I love what people wear and how they present themselves. But fundamentally, the biggest thing is people just being themselves.”",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/dec/22/instagram-twitter-accounts-uk-clubs-nightlife
81,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-21,"Elon Musk was never a liberal, and his plans for Twitter were never benevolent | Thomas Zimmer","On Monday, Elon Musk polled Twitter users on whether he should step down as CEO. The answer was a resounding yes. On Tuesday, Musk announced that he will step down once he finds a replacement. Still, the damage has been done: Musk’s tenure has been a disaster for democracy. Since Elon Musk took over Twitter, he has encouraged far-right conspiracy theories, consistently articulated rightwing extremist ideas and coddled extremists who propagated them, changed or undermined content moderation in a way that allowed hate speech and far-right abuse to flourish, and constantly derided Democrats, liberals and anyone he perceives as part of “the Left” in an escalating crusade against “wokeism”. He is now banning critical voices, including those of mainstream journalists, under obviously disingenuous pretenses. Musk’s actions are fully consistent with the worldview that dominates among far-right reactionary extremists. Yet, many observers seem reluctant to acknowledge that what is happening is exactly what it looks like. People who cover the tech world are still searching for a grand business strategy that would explain all this behavior. And some people whose main occupation is to cover politics are also struggling. The New York Times recently declared Musk’s politics “tricky to pin down”, and said that “what he stands for remains largely unclear”. The source of confusion seems to be that Musk’s actions collide with certain assumptions about the supposedly liberal tech world and with Musk’s own previous claims about his political leanings. But the male-dominated tech world seemed “liberal” only because it was associated with technical progress, while most of the (predominantly male) tech oligarchs were happy to present a culturally permissive image. And people say all sorts of things about their political leanings and may even believe them – that doesn’t mean we should take their proclamations at face value. What people actually do, the political projects they support, is far more relevant. So, what’s up with Musk’s politics? There are more or less fruitful ways to tackle that question. It is not very useful to obsess over what Musk “really” believes, or react to every one of his trolling attempts by trying to disprove and debunk them. We should instead engage the underlying political project – because it constitutes a direct threat to democracy and it is the reason why simply ignoring a man with such a powerful platform will not work. From a democratic perspective, it’s highly problematic that tech oligarchs like Musk are amassing so much power and influence. They are not democratically controlled in any way or guided by any concern for the public good. Musk is yet another example of how short the path from a certain kind of libertarianism to the far right is, a reminder that this type of libertarianism is driven by a desire for freedom from regulation and criticism of any kind. Musk believes that the world works best if people like him are in charge and get to do as they please, unhampered by regulations or demands for equality – because their interests ought to be the same as humanity’s. It’s an inherently anti-democratic worldview that tracks very well with the reactionary idea that the world should be run by wealthy white men. This is what is pulling these people to the right, and why they eventually gravitate toward autocratic regimes at home and abroad. But what about the fact that Musk doesn’t subscribe to all the typical “conservative” policy positions and never described himself as a “conservative”? Well, he certainly subscribes to the only position that matters on the right today: he is rabidly anti-“Left”. It has become dogma on the right to define Democrats, liberals and “the Left” as an illegitimate, “un-American” threat – that all measures, regardless of how extreme, are justified in the defense of “real America” against the “woke” onslaught. That’s exactly where Musk is. This doesn’t necessarily signal a fundamental change of his politics and worldview. It’s more plausible to think of his trajectory as an activation of reactionary sensibilities and an accelerating process of radicalization, but not an aberration. Much like other predominantly white, predominantly male elites who have been radicalizing to the right, Musk’s acceptance of democracy and pluralism was always conditional and contingent largely on whether or not it would be set up in a way that preserved their status at the top. That certainly doesn’t mean Musk was ever on board with the idea of leveling traditional hierarchies of wealth, race, or gender – clearly, he was not. As soon as his elite status as an obscenely wealthy white man was scrutinized, his fundamental politics was activated. And now that inherently anti-democratic, anti-egalitarian worldview is animating the man in charge of the world’s most important political communications platform, a virtual public square functioning as an essential part of democratic culture. Twitter could have been, should have been, so much better. But its enormous influence on the broader public, media and political discourses is undeniable. Twitter established a conversation between people in positions to shape the political and public imaginary – journalists, politicians, public figures – and people who would otherwise never have access to those levels of influence. Most importantly, Twitter has been instrumental in amplifying the voices, demands, and critiques of traditionally marginalized groups. That’s where it really demonstrated its democratizing potential. Much of the moral panic over “cancel culture” – which animated Musk to buy Twitter in the first place – is a reaction to the fact that traditionally marginalized groups gained technological means to affect the political debate. Twitter has been crucial in this uphill struggle: a tool for organizing, a platform, a global amplifier that enabled people with no traditional access to power to speak to powerful elites directly and criticize them in the public square. How valuable this has been is evidenced by the fact that many of those elites are so consistently bemoaning “persecution” – and, like Musk, wish to sabotage and destroy this instrument for public criticism. To the extent that traditional societal elites – and elite white men in particular – face a little more scrutiny today than in the past, Twitter has helped to democratize public life. Losing this will hurt – it will hurt the attempts to finally make America live up to the promise of egalitarian multiracial pluralism, to become the democracy it never has been yet. It is a massive failure that those elected to safeguard democracy have seemingly cared little about this.

82,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-21,Elon Musk says he will resign as Twitter CEO when he finds a ‘foolish enough’ replacement,"Elon Musk said on Tuesday that he will not step down as chief executive of the company until he can find a suitable replacement, citing the state of the company’s finances as a reason to delay his promised departure. “I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software &amp; servers teams,” Musk tweeted, before joining a Twitter livestream to discuss the company’s situation with a former intern. It was the first time Musk had mentioned leaving the role as chief of the social media platform since Twitter users voted decisively in a poll for him to step down, which the billionaire launched on Sunday evening. But the acknowledgement was far from a firm commitment to keep to his promise. In the broadcast, Musk chatted with audience members about his experience at the company, and emphasised the necessity of cutting costs. Under his watch, Twitter is down to “a little over 2,000 people”, he said, having been facing a “negative cash flow situation of $3bn [£2.48bn] a year” until he arrived, describing the situation as “net dead”. “That’s why I spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy,” he said, to ensure that Twitter would be “roughly cash flow breakeven” by 2023. Even now, running the company is as though “you’re in a plane heading to the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don’t work”. Some of the company’s costs, he acknowledged, were a result of his own acquisition, which saddled the company with $12.5bn of debt that it has to pay out of its revenues. But “with the changes we are making here on massively reducing the burn rate, and building subscriber revenue, I now think that Twitter will, in fact, be OK next year.” This week’s Twitter poll, sent in the wake of watching the World Cup final in Doha with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, is not the first time Musk has said he will not run the company in the long term. In November, the second-richest person in the world told a court in Delaware he would reduce his time at Twitter and eventually find someone to run it in his place. Calls on Wall Street for Musk to step down had been growing for weeks, and recently Tesla investors have questioned whether his focus on the social media platform is distracting him from properly steering the electric vehicle business. Musk admitted in the court hearing that he had too much on his plate. He said on Sunday, though, that there was no successor and “no one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive”. Prior to Tuesday’s tweet, Musk’s only response to the poll was to tweet claims that the results had been skewed by fake accounts. He also responded to a tweet suggesting only users who were paying $8 or $11 (for iOS subscribers) for a Twitter Blue subscription should be able to vote in the polls by saying Twitter would “make that change.” The poll calling for him to stand down followed a series of highly criticised decisions by Twitter’s new owner. He first banned an account that tracked the location of his private jet, and followed it up with a mass suspension of critical journalists who reported on the ban. After users responded by announcing plans to leave to other platforms, Musk implemented a new policy banning all links to other social networks, including Mastodon, Instagram and Facebook. The change was made during the Fifa World Cup final in Qatar, where Musk was spotted in attendance with Kushner. By the end of the day, the policy had been abandoned, with Musk saying all major policy changes in the future would be decided by a vote.

83,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-20,"Twitter users voted Elon Musk out. But CEO or not, he’ll still call the shots | Sarah Manavis","Since its launch, few people have embodied the worst of Twitter like Elon Musk. The site is a magnet for the self-involved, the kind of people who think a few likes and retweets confirm that they are always right; the types who walk through life with blinkers on and a mirror fixed directly in front of them. Through relentless efforts to be seen as funny, tweeting stale memes and tired jokes, and his transparent desperation to be liked, tanking his own stock price to delight his followers, Musk’s Twitter persona was infamous. But it was also a common type on the site: someone eager to be seen as in on the joke, a lovable troll, but, crucially, someone who is also actually bad at using Twitter on a basic level. The adulation of his diehard fans sometimes masked the fact that most people don’t like these kinds of characters online. If this wasn’t glaringly obvious before Musk bought Twitter, it is now. There has been little respite from the chaos of Musk’s Twitter since he took over just under two months ago. He is the constant centre of attention. He has fired employees and tinkered with core features as if on a whim. Accounts mocking Musk have been suspended, and hate speech has soared in this short space of time. As a result, advertisers have fled the platform, leading to “massive” drops in revenue. What has made it all the more surreal is that, throughout this never-ending car crash, Musk has consistently tweeted every few hours, seemingly incorporating advice he receives from random users into the platform with almost immediate effect, and pondering major business decisions out loud to an audience of millions. But this tumultuous few months reached a frenzied climax this weekend – which may mark the end of Musk’s time as Twitter’s chief executive. On Thursday and Friday, several of the most prominent journalists covering Musk were suspended from Twitter after Musk claimed they had “doxed” him by sharing posts from a longstanding Twitter account that tracked where Musk’s private jet had flown (this type of flight record is legally public and not in violation of privacy laws, but the private jet account was also suspended). Shortly thereafter, users began to notice Twitter was marking posts linking to a competitor site, Mastodon, as “unsafe”, removing tweets containing these links and preventing users from posting new ones with links to the site. The weekend ended with a poll posted by Musk himself late on Sunday night asking: “Should I step down as head of Twitter?”, saying he would “abide by the results”. The option “yes” won with 57.5% of the more than 17m votes. Whether Musk is sticking to his word is yet to be confirmed - though he has been active on the platform, replying “interesting” to several users who suggested bots voted in the poll, and tweeting that only paid subscribers would be able to vote in future. Though many predicted that Musk’s Twitter deal would be a disaster, few could have guessed it would have been quite as disastrous as this. But Musk is not alone: 2022 has seen some of Silicon Valley’s most famous tech CEOs lose what sheen of “genius” they still clung to. Mass job losses at Meta, after a year spent tinkering with Instagram and the metaverse, had many asking if Mark Zuckerberg had lost his touch. Redundancies at Amazon, after Jeff Bezos repeatedly blasted himself alongside various celebrities into space, have had a similar effect. In the case of Musk, the embarrassment he is experiencing may feel like a satisfying bit of schadenfreude. However, although Twitter is small compared with the likes of TikTok or even Facebook, it is – as Musk is keen to emphasise – the internet’s town square. And it has now been decimated as a result of his ego. Though it seems unlikely that he expected it to go so badly, Musk stepping down as chief executive may have always been part of the plan. During his testimony at a trial surrounding his remuneration package at Tesla on 16 November, Musk said he didn’t want to be CEO of any company – not just Twitter – and that his role within the platform was temporary, with plans to eventually appoint someone else to the role. He has done this before: Musk ran a Twitter poll last year asking users if he should sell some of his Tesla stock, only for it to be revealed he had already agreed to sell a portion several days before posting the tweet. The past six weeks has solidified Musk as Twitter’s worst character, unmasking the desperation behind the trolling persona he has long projected. It feels fitting that the end of his tenure would come with a giant poll of his own making asking people to say whether they liked him or not. But even if he isn’t in the CEO role, Musk will remain Twitter’s owner after he steps down, with a new chief executive of his choosing. The only difference may be a Twitter now being destroyed behind closed doors, rather than one whose destruction is live-tweeted, out in the open.

84,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-20,Elon Musk breaks silence after 10 million Twitter users vote for him to step down,"Elon Musk has tweeted for the first time since more than 10 million people voted in favour of him stepping down as Twitter’s chief executive, saying that only paid Twitter Blue subscribers will be able to vote in future policy-related polls. On Sunday, Musk asked Twitter users whether he should step down as the head of the company, promising to abide by the results of his poll. When the poll closed on Monday, 57.5% said he should step down. Normally a prolific user of the platform, Musk did not tweet in the immediate hours after the poll. His silence was finally broken when he responded with “Interesting” to multiple suggestions that the results of the poll were skewed by fake accounts. Replying to another user’s suggestion that “Blue subscribers should be the only ones that can vote in policy related polls”, Musk said: “Good point. Twitter will make that change.” Twitter Blue is a paid-for subscription that allows anyone to buy a blue tick verified badge for their account. As the majority owner of the privately held company, no one can force Musk out, but a series of baffling decisions over the past few days has caused even some of his closest backers to break ties with him. A decision to ban an account that tracked the location of his private jet last week was followed by a mass suspension of critical journalists who reported on the ban. That led in turn to an exodus of some engaged users to other social networks, chiefly its decentralised competitor Mastodon, whose own account was banned for posting a link to the jet tracker’s account on the rival platform. On Sunday, Musk reacted by banning all links to other social networks, including Mastodon, Instagram, Facebook, and even minor platforms such as Nostr, used by the Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, and Linktree, a homepage creation tool favoured by influencers. That ban was rescinded by the end of the day, after a Twitter poll from the Twitter Safety account, with Musk saying: “Going forward, there will be a vote for major policy changes. My apologies. Won’t happen again.” Musk has a history of using Twitter polls to rubber-stamp major decisions, selling a tenth of his Tesla holdings after one poll in 2021, restoring Donald Trump’s account after a second last month and reinstating a number of suspended accounts after a third. “Vox Populi, Vox Dei,” Musk tweeted after the Trump poll. However, in many cases, he has given the impression of already having decided on the outcome before posting: he had already announced a sale of his Tesla holdings, for instance, long before he put it to a vote, and his plan to reinstate Trump had been discussed since before he even bought Twitter. The idea of stepping down as chief executive had also been hinted at long before the Twitter poll was published. On 16 November, he told a Delaware judge that he planned to reduce his time at Twitter and “find somebody else to run Twitter over time”.

He then suspended the accounts of some prominent journalists who reported on the furore, then banned any promotion of “third-party platforms”, after users began discussing where they would go when they left Twitter. The moves caused instant pushback. Blocking people from leaving is hardly a sign of confidence in your ability to convince them to stay. Users pointed out that Musk himself had said in June that: “The acid test for any two competing … systems is which side needs to build a wall to keep people from escaping.” Musk quickly U-turned on the journalism suspensions and third-party rule, and promised to put any future major changes to a poll of users. But the damage appears to have been done. He’s been planning this for a while The suggestion that Musk would step back didn’t come out of nowhere. “There’s an initial burst of activity needed post-acquisition to reorganise the company,” he told a Delaware court last month in testimony defending his $56bn pay package at Tesla. “But then I expect to reduce my time at Twitter.” Despite that, he insisted he did not have a successor in mind, gnomically tweeting that “those who want power are the ones who least deserve it”. However, he has brought in close confidants to help him oversee Twitter, with venture capitalist allies Jason Calacanis and David Sacks each taking on semi-official roles. Both men have a long history of running large companies, with Sacks staying on as chief operating officer of PayPal after Musk was fired as its chief executive, and Calacanis building the blogging empire Weblogs Inc, before selling it to AOL. He has experience as a hands-off owner The open secret of Musk’s success is that he only really runs two of the three major companies of which he is chief executive. While employees of Twitter and Tesla describe him as fearsomely hands-on, at SpaceX the day-to-day operations are overseen by the president and chief operating officer, Gwynne Shotwell. She joined in 2002, the same year Musk founded the company, and her job is still about carrying out his vision. These days that means reassuring Nasa that Musk isn’t going to wreck SpaceX in the process of torching Twitter. Nasa administrator Bill Nelson told reporters last week that he asked Shotwell if Twitter would be a “distraction”, and she said it wouldn’t. “I hugged her with a smile on my face, because I know she is running that thing. She’s running SpaceX,” Nelson told reporters. What does ‘good’ management mean at Twitter? The big question, though, is whether Twitter can be saved by a competent administrator like Shotwell – or if it’s too tied up in US culture wars to be quietly and soundly managed. Before Musk bought the company, Parag Agrawal was supposed to be exactly that sort of leader, promoted from the company’s engineering department to take over after Jack Dorsey left. But in his short time at the top, Agrawal learned that running a social network brings you in to the political sphere, whether you like it or not. Whoever replaces Musk will have to deal with the same problems. And with Musk still very much the owner, and still embroiled in political sparring, their freedom to deal with those issues independently will be heavily constrained.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/19/what-we-know-about-elon-musks-week-and-whats-in-store-for-twitter
86,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-19,Elon Musk needs to realise Twitter is a hobby and Tesla is his priority | Nils Pratley ,"There are two theories about Elon Musk’s latest online poll. One says he was genuinely interested in whether Twitter users think he should step down as chief executive of the social media site. A second says he has already accepted that he’ll have to give up day-to-day management and, in usual attention-seeking style, was creating fake drama around the event. The second idea sounds more plausible. Musk can surely see – as many shareholders of Tesla have been saying in recent weeks – that there are risks in tying his personal brand so closely to Twitter’s. The job of designing, producing and selling electric vehicles is not made easier if the public face of the car company is also at the centre of storms over who Twitter is banning or unbanning this week. “Customers don’t want their cars to be controversial. They want to be proud as hell to drive them – not embarrassed,” said Gary Black, the managing partner of Future Fund, whose biggest investment is Tesla, last week. Quite. Another consideration is the amount of Musk’s energy that Twitter is consuming. Having paid $44bn for the business (probably at least twice what it was worth), Musk was always going to play with his new toy for a while but any time-and-motion analysis would suggest that the sooner he gets back to the day job the better. Tesla, even after the 62% plunge in its share price this year, is valued at $475bn (£391bn) and the long-term value of Musk’s 13% stake is what matters most for his long-term wealth. So, yes, best to recruit a full-time Twitter boss who can bring some managerial blandness to placate the advertisers and staff. Musk’s subsequent tweet that “there is no successor” merely describes the situation today; he hasn’t looked properly. The happiest people would be Tesla’s other shareholders if Musk decides merely to own, rather than actively run, Twitter. Black suggests the car company’s non-executive directors have been putting the squeeze on Musk to get back to duties at the quoted company. That also sounds plausible. Somebody has to point out the bleedin’ obvious to him: Twitter is a hobby, albeit an expensive one; Tesla is a proper company that should be his priority. Cap on bankers’ bonuses was always flawed Those who regard it as a moral outrage that the government wants to remove the cap on bankers’ bonuses should read the Bank of England’s analysis on Monday of how the EU-inspired policy has worked in practice. Short summary: the cap just inflated fixed salaries; and it has probably made banks less safe. That is because the bonus cap, despite its name, does not constrain what an individual can be paid. Rather, it caps the ratio between the fixed and variable components of a pay packet. A bonus can only be worth 100% of salary or, if the shareholders agree, 200%. With high-flyers who had previously been offered, say, a 500% bonus, it didn’t require imagination to see what would happen when a mechanical ratio was applied. Fixed pay would be boosted because the individuals would demand it. Virtually from the day the EU introduced its rule, banks invented “role-based allowances” as salary add-ons. The consultation paper from the Bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority sets out the gritty details of how the system operates today. When the bonus ratio of a “material risk taker” – those covered by cap – gets close to 200%, their fixed pay tends to rise “much faster” than peers’ in the following year. “This suggests that firms are choosing to increase fixed pay to compensate in-scope individuals as a consequence of the bonus cap constraint,” it says. The regulators call this outcome an “unintended consequence” of the cap, but could equally have said the EU was grossly naive to think bankers would just swallow smaller overall pay packets. In the real world, overall remuneration rates in European investment banking are mostly influenced by what Wall Street pays. UK regulators opposed the bonus cap in the first place for reasons of financial safety: a bigger contractual bill for salaries leaves less room to preserve capital in a crisis by slashing discretionary bonuses. It was a sound argument at the time, and it remains so. It is why the Bank is right to recommend getting rid of the cap now. Yes, the optics are terrible because “bankers’ bonuses” is a toxic phrase. But the unfortunate reality is that the EU, having correctly identified that skewed incentives contributed to the 2008 crash, came up with a solution that didn’t tackle the problem. The design of the cap was always flawed.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/dec/19/elon-musk-needs-to-realise-twitter-is-a-hobby-and-tesla-is-his-priority
87,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-19,Elon Musk’s Twitter poll says he should step down as chief executive – as it happened,"Here’s a quick summary of what’s happened today in business news: Elon Musk’s fate as Twitter CEO is uncertain after he released a poll asking Twitter users whether he should step down as head of Twitter. Over 57% of 17.5m users who voted said that he should. Though Musk said he would abide by the results of the poll, he has not made any announcements regarding plans to step down. A union representing Twitter staff in the UK cautioned that even if Musk steps down as CEO, he would still be owner of the company. UK spring budget will be delivered on 15 March, chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced today. The US Federal Trade Commission announced a settlement with Epic Games, the maker of popular video game Fortnite, for a total $520m. The agency said the company violated child privacy protection laws. We’re pausing this blog for now but will return if any news around Musk and Twitter arises. Thank you for reading. Two California-based employees are accusing Tesla of retaliation after they were fired while participating in a group that was drafting letters critical of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The employees filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board last week, according to Bloomberg. The letters drafted by the group asked company executives to reconsider Musk’s return-to-office police, saying that they violated Tesla’s anti-harassment policy. Both employees were fired in June – one was told that their discussions on Tesla were “an attack” on the company. A week after his arrest last Monday, former FTX chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried is appearing in court in the Bahamas, where is being held in custody. While Bankman-Fried had indicated he would fight extradition charges, it seems that he could agree to an extradition, according to CNN. In court on Monday, Bankman-Fried asked to see a copy of his indictment and then was granted a phone call with his US-based attorneys. Bankman-Fried faces eight charges of conspiracy and fraud for his actions at FTX and private equity firm Alameda Research. The European Union is accusing Meta of violating antitrust rules by “distorting competition in the markets for online classified ads”, the European Commission said on Monday. The commission said that it “takes issue with Meta tying its online classified ads service, Facebook Marketplace, to its personal social network, Facebook,” it said in a statement. It is also accusing Meta of imposing unfair trading conditions to its competitors of Facebook marketplace. The tie, it says, “gives Facebook Marketplace a substantial distribution advantage that competitors cannot match”. The commission said its statement of objections to Meta is a “preliminary view” after it opened an investigation into the company in June 2021 but does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation. It is unclear when the investigation will end as there is no legal deadline for an antitrust investigation. US senator Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to the chair of Tesla’s board of investors Robyn Denholm Sunday night saying Elon Musk may not be the fully dedicated CEO the company needs. “As you know, it is the legal obligation of Tesla’s board to ensure that its CEO is meeting all his legal responsibilities as an effective leader,” Warren wrote, according to the New York Times. Warren inquired whether Musk sending Tesla employees to work at Twitter – at least 50 Tesla employees were pulled into Twitter since Musk took over at the end of October – is harming the company. She also suggested that Musk could be using one company to benefit the other, for example charging Tesla more for ads or readjusting Twitter’s algorithm to benefit Tesla, what could be antitrust violations. “The problems identified in this letter are not merely theoretical,” Warren wrote, noting that Tesla’s stock has fallen as Musk conducted over his takeover of Twitter. She said there could be “significant legal questions” about the relationship between the two companies in the future. In a tweet on Epic Games settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the company’s CEO Tim Sweeney said the settlements reflect how American regulatory practices are changing. “Developers should dig into the topic, as this settlement reflects state of the art American regulatory practice,” Sweeney said. While Epic Games is framing the settlement as a change in regulatory practices, the FTC says that the company knew the children were playing without parents’ consent. “Firms cannot put growth and revenue over the safety and privacy of their users, especially children and teens,” said FTC chair Lina Khan in a series of tweets. The company “put children and teens at risk with privacy invasive default settings”. “Notably, our complaint states that these default settings caused substantial harm and constituted ‘unfair’ practices against both kids and teens,” she said. Epic Games, which the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) just announced agreed to pay $520m in settlements over privacy law violations, released a statement on the settlement saying “no developer creates a game with the intention of ending up here”. “The video game industry is a place of fast-moving innovation, where player expectations are high and new ideas are paramount,” the statement said. “Statutes written decades ago don’t specify how gaming ecosystems should operate. The laws have not changed, but their application has evolved and long-standing industry practices are no longer enough.” “We accepted this agreement because we want Epic to be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players,” the company said. This is Lauren Aratani in New York taking over. Epic Games, the creator of the popular video game Fortnite, is agreeing to pay the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) a total of $520m for two settlements after violating children’s privacy law, the FTC announced this morning. The agency said the video game maker “deployed design tricks, known as dark patterns, to dupe millions of players into making unintentional purchases.” The company is agreeing to pay two settlements: $275m for violating the agency’s Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which bans companies from disclosing, collecting or using information from children under 13 and $245m as a refund to consumers for “its dark patterns and billing practices”. The FTC said the settlements are the largest monetary penalty for violating the privacy protection act and the largest refund in a gaming case. “Epic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive interfaces that tricked Fortnite users, including teenagers and children,” FTC chair Lina Khan said in a statement. “Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the commission.” Fortnite gained popularity in 2018, generating Epic Games $9bn in the game’s first two years of existence. Wall Street has been trading for about half an hour, and Tesla shares have enjoyed a small bump. The carmaker’s value was up by 1.7% at the time of writing at $152.72 – less than the 4.5% move at one point in pre-open trading. Of course, that does not make up for the large losses endured by shareholders this year, but with a stock of this size it does mean a $5bn gain – Musk’s 13% shareholding would equate to about $650m in paper valuation. That would not be a bad return for most Twitter polls. Former Meta chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Nextdoor boss Sarah Friar would make for good candidates to lead Twitter, says the Financial Times’s Lex column. Sandberg announced her resignation from Facebook in June, after transforming it into one of the biggest advertising companies in the world. She was seen as an “adult in the room” beside founder Mark Zuckerberg. Perhaps the same steadying hand could help at Elon Musk’s company. Friar was previously finance boss at Square, the payments company set up by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, so the FT (£) reckons she could help with Musk’s aims for Twitter to become a “superapp” offering payments, among other things. A rare Northern Irish (she’s from County Tyrone, if you’re asking) transplant to California, she also has Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, and the universities of Oxford and Stanford on her CV. There is also a sting in the tail of the FT’s piece: it reckons that Twitter’s valuation is only just over a third of what Musk and his backers actually paid. That is value destruction to rival Tesla during 2022. Valued at about three times trailing revenue (equal to similar-sized peer Snap), Twitter’s enterprise value would now be just $15bn. So who is likely to take over from Musk as CEO of Twitter? TechCrunch editor at large Mike Butcher says it’s likely to be someone quite “commercially minded” from Silicon Valley that can put Twitter on an “even keel.” Butcher says no one thought Musk was going to stay in the job forever, and was likely under pressure from Tesla’s board, who have watched shares plunge following a string of controversies linked to his takeover of Twitter. He said it’s very likely that Musk will leave, it’s just a matter of when. Mike Butcher, editor at large at TechCrunch, tells Sky News that it’s very likely that Musk had a plan already in place before he issuing the Twitter poll. Elon Musk is very mercurial so it’s very hard to tell whether or not he’ll actually abide by the poll, but it’s more likely that he already had a plan ahead of doing that poll. It’s not quite clear what that plan is exactly, but Butcher notes that Musk issued the Tweet after landing in Qatar for the World Cup final. He says Musk “most certainly” had talks with investors, given he has backers in the region who helped him take over Twitter in the first place. One thing you can be sure of its that he’ll do whatever he wants…whether he’s said one thing earlier or not. It’s as simple as that. So we’ll have to wait and see. In terms of current management teams, Butcher notes that Musk is surrounded by people who “do his bidding” and that there is no longer a board to really speak of. “So it’s really down to one man, pretty much all of it”. The staff themselves have had to figure out what Twitter should be doing via his tweets rather than through any internal communications, as might normally happen inside any “normal company” It’s been a “totally chaotic period under Musk’s leadership”, Butcher adds. A union which represents some of Twitter’s UK staff says that even if Musk does honour the poll and steps down as CEO, the social media firm’s strategy is unlikely to change given he still owns the company. Furthermore, the way Musk hinged his decision on the outcome of an online poll is yet another sign of the “deep issues” plaguing the company under his watch, according to the Prospect union’s general secretary Mike Clancy. Clancy said in a statement: This latest erratic behaviour by Elon Musk, once again underlines the deep issues over the way this company is being run. Whether or not Musk carries through on this vote, and is the chief executive going forward, he will still own the business. This means it seems highly doubtful that we will see a sea change in strategy. The way that Twitter under Musk has treated its staff has been appalling, riding roughshod over the principles that underpin UK employment law. What is needed is a fundamental change in approach, rather than more attention seeking, knee jerk decision making. In case Musk is on the hunt for a replacement, Snoop Dog had issued his own tongue-in-cheek poll and asking his own followers whether the rapper should replace the Tesla boss as head of Twitter: More than 10 million people voted in favour of Elon Musk stepping down as chief executive of Twitter in a poll he posted on the site late on Sunday. The billionaire, who bought the company and installed himself as its head just 50 days ago, has insisted there is no successor in the wings. “No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive,” he said on the social network. “There is no successor.” Replying to another user who said they could do the job, Musk added “you must like pain a lot. One catch: you have to invest your life savings in Twitter and it has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy since May. Still want the job?” Musk has a history of using Twitter polls to rubber-stamp major decisions, selling a tenth of his Tesla holdings after one poll in 2021, restoring Donald Trump’s account after a second last month and reinstating a swath of suspended accounts following a third. “Vox Populi, Vox Dei”, Musk tweeted after the Trump poll. You can read the full story – including details of the chaos surrounding account bans – here: If Musk does follow through on his promise to “abide by the results” of the poll there is one group of people who would almost certainly be pleased: investors in Tesla. Musk’s focus on the social network has come at a time when Tesla shares have been under enormous and sustained pressure. That has not been aided by Musk’s need to sell Tesla shares worth billions to fund the Twitter deal. Tesla shares have gained 4.5% in pre-market trading on Monday to above $157 – up from just over $150 at Friday’s close, according to data from Google. The value of the company had fallen by 50% to $470bn (£387bn) over the course of 2022. That is still enormous, but less than the $1 trillion valuation it achieved in October 2021. Rival carmakers are catching up with electric vehicles and there has also been a broader rout in tech shares as rising interest rates diminished the relative value of future earnings. The US stock market benchmark, the S&amp;P 500, fell by 16% over the same time period. Dan Ives, a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, a US investment bank, said if Musk hands the reins of Twitter over it would be a “major positive” and allow Musk to stop the damage on Tesla. Ives has a price target of $250 for Tesla shares. “Time to end this nightmare as CEO of Twitter,” he said in a note sent to clients on Monday. From the botched verification subscription plan to banning journalists to political firestorms caused on a daily basis [it has] been the perfect storm as advertisers have run for the hills and left Twitter squarely in the red ink potentially on track to lose roughly $4bn per year we estimate. More red ink means funding gaps causing Musk to sell more Tesla stock which has been used as his own personal ATM machine since this saga began in April. As such, this has been a black eye moment for Musk and been a major overhang on Tesla’s stock which continues to suffer in a brutal way since the Twitter soap opera began with brand deterioration related to Musk a real issue. Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk. Attention focused on Twitter instead of golden child Tesla has been another big issue for investors and likely is behind this poll results with many Musk loyalists wanting him to leave as CEO of Twitter. With the poll closing this morning, it appears Musk’s reign as CEO of Twitter will come to end and thus be a major positive for Tesla’s stock starting to slowly remove this albatross from the story. All eyes will now be on Elon Musk’s own Twitter account to hear what his next steps might be. However, it is unclear when he will comment – not least because he may still be in the air. Musk’s private jet took off from Doha about three hours ago, where he was watching the final of the football World Cup. *There is of course an irony in reporting on the movements of his jet: the source for these data is an automated social media account on Instagram called Elon Musk’s Jet. Musk himself banned the Twitter version of the account, and several journalists covering his actions, after accusing them of “doxxing” him by posting details of his whereabouts. He then reversed some of the bans a few days later. Confirmation: Elon Musk’s Twitter poll says he should step down as chief executive of the social media company. There were 17,502,391 votes. 57.5% were in favour. 42.5% were against. *This post has been updated. The total vote figure rose by about 200,000 following the closure of the poll. With only about three minutes left, it looks very likely that Elon Musk’s Twitter poll will say he should step down as chief executive. Twitter polls are hardly binding votes, but Musk does have a history of following through on them. It is unclear what Musk’s plan is, given the lack of an obvious successor. Musk himself spent Sunday in Qatar watching Argentina win the football world cup. Pictures from the stadium showed him standing beside Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of Donald Trump. Trump, of course, used Twitter to his advantage during his US presidential run, and then started a rival social media company, Truth Social. Twitter briefly banned users from posting links to rival social media companies, including Truth Social and larger rivals such as Instagram and Facebook. And as chancellor Jeremy Hunt prepares for a range of City reforms in a bit to spur growth, the Bank of England has launched the first of a raft of consultations: this time on the banker bonus cap. Plans to scrap the EU cap were first announced during the September mini-budget, paving the way for bankers to earn more than 200% of their salaries in bonuses. However, recruiters and bankers are sceptical that it will spark much change here in the UK – where bankers have grown accustomed to higher fixed pay, which by and large rose to compensate for the bonus cap which came into force in 2014: However, the Bank of England said as part of the consultation: The proposed changes should…help remove unintended consequences that have arisen as a result of the bonus cap, namely growth in the proportion of the fixed component of total remuneration, which reduces firms’ ability to adjust costs to absorb losses in a downturn. The proportion of Twitter users voting for Musk to resign as head of Twitter is climbing with 50 minutes left to go: Yes: 57.6% No: 42.4% In a written statement regarding the UK spring budget, chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said: Today I can inform the House that I have asked the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to prepare a forecast for 15March 2023 to accompany a spring budget. This forecast, in addition to the forecast that took place in November 2022, will fulfil the obligation for the OBR to produce at least two forecasts in a financial year, as is required by legislation. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, will deliver the spring budget on 15 March 2023, according to Reuters. And for the avoidance of any doubt (given the controversy that followed the lack of forecasts alongside the disastrous mini-budget delivered by ex-PM Liz Truss and her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng) the Office for Budget Responsibility has been commissioned to prepare forecasts alongside the presentation, Reuters adds. Call it Chekhov’s Jet: a Twitter account placed on the mantelpiece in act one must surely go off in act five. Seven days after buying the social network he tweeted that his commitment to free speech extended even “to not banning the account following my plane”. Six weeks later, his reversal of that policy set in motion a series of events that seems increasingly likely to end in his dramatic departure as chief executive of Twitter. On Thursday, Musk banned the @ElonJet account, claiming to be spooked by an apparently unrelated altercation with a man who was stalking his ex-wife. On Friday, he suspended the accounts of a number of journalists who had reported on his move. On Saturday, he suspended the account of Taylor Lorenz, a reporter at The Washington Post who had sent him a request for comment on the site, later claiming it was for “historical doxing offences”: breaking a rule that hadn’t existed when she broke it, with tweets that were no longer live on the site. On Sunday, he reinstated her account, before immediately banning her permanently, for breaking another newly created rule: a ban on any promotion of accounts on other social networks, a policy apparently instated in a hurry over the weekend in an attempt to stem the flow of users leaving the social network for sites not run at the whim of a vengeful billionaire. Like the old woman who swallowed the fly, each time Musk reacts to the problems he’s caused, he creates bigger and bigger problems for himself. If his offer to step down is to be taken at face value, it would represent a rare moment of insight in his 50 days at the top of Twitter: the realisation that the only common cause of all of Musk’s problems on social media are Musk himself. Telsa investors seem to pleased with the way that Musk’s Twitter poll is leaning towards his potential resignation, with shares up 4% in pre-market trading: Economic data interlude: The German Ifo business climate data for December shows confidence among the country’s firms rose more than expected, despite the energy crisis and high inflation. The index rose from 86.4 in November to 88.6 this month. A Reuters poll of analysts had suggested the reading would be closer to 87.4. A quick update on Musk’s Twitter resignation poll, which has now attracted 15.8 million votes with just two hours left to go: Yes: 57.4% No: 42.6% Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says Musk’s Twitter controversies are compounding other issues for Tesla, which is already grappling with supply shortages and increased competition. Scholar explains: The electric carmaker has been one of the worst performers in US tech this year, down by more than 60% following a meteoric surge for the stock of more than 1600% from the 2020 trough to the peak in 2021. Tesla has had the added pressure this year from Elon Musk’s Twitter acquisition which has distracted the billionaire, taking his attention away from the EV giant. Even prior to the Twitter deal, Musk was already spreading himself very thinly with SpaceX, Neuralink, the Boring Company as well as Tesla. It’s also worth remembering that Musk used his Tesla shares to help fund his $44bn takeover of Twitter, which has also caused concern among investors. Musk has been using Tesla stock to fund his Twitter deal by selling a total of $22.9bn worth of Tesla stock this year in another sign he is taking his eye off the ball and weighing on investor confidence. Tesla has had a series of headwinds to grapple with from growing competition in the EV space, the global chip shortage, problems with the global supply chain and the shift in investor preferences away from technology. Investors remain cautious towards technology in 2023 and Musk’s Twitter distraction certainly doesn’t help. Shares in Tesla, the electric car company that is responsible for making Elon Musk one of the richest men in the world, continue to suffer in after-hours trading. The stock price is down a further 0.77%, adding to further pain for shareholders. Tesla shares having plunged more than 62% so far this year – a fall that is partly linked to the continued controversies related to Musk’s forays into social media ownership. A quick check in on European equity markets, where major indices are trading higher at the start of trading: FTSE 100 is up 0.36% FTSE 250 is up 0.2% Germany’s Xetra Dax is up 0.68% France’s Cac 40 is up 0.7% Italy’s FTSE MIB is up 0.6% Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at US investment firm Wedbush Securities, says Musk’s willingness to step back may be linked to the fact that controversies linked to Twitter have started to damage his “golden child”: Tesla. Ives told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning that while Musk has not necessarily followed through with the decisive calls of Twitter polls in the past, this time is different: The last few weeks, few months, [have] been a black eye for Musk and a black eye for Tesla, and I think ultimately that’s the golden child: that 90% plus of his wealth. And that’s why I think the writings on the wall, and I think ultimately in the next 24 hours, Musk will probably name a temporary CEO of Twitter. Ives said it’s clear that Musk needs to stick to his strengths: He can build rockets and create electric cars. That’s why he is who he is. But when it comes to social media and to Twitter, I think this is a diff type of animal, and he’s realised he can’t balance this as well as Tesla and Space X. And I think the writing’s on the wall that he cannot be CEO of Twitter. And as for how quickly we could see changes enacted, Ives reckons the executive overhaul could be triggered within hours. I think the pressure was building, I think ultimately, probably in the next 5-6 hours, it’s going to be the end of Musk reigning as CEO of Twitter. Full story: Musk sets up Twitter poll asking if he should step down as head Elon Musk has asked Twitter users whether he should step down as the head of the company, promising to abide by the results of his poll. Musk assumed the role of CEO at the end of October after firing a host of senior executives and dissolving its board of directors. Within minutes of posting the poll, more than 1 million people had voted. After 20 minutes of polling, when the yes vote gained a double-digit lead, Musk responded to a suggestion that he had already picked a new CEO, saying: “No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the economy, business and the financial markets. Less than two months after Elon Musk controversially bought Twitter for $44m and installed himself as CEO of the company, he is putting his fate in the hands of its users. Following a string of controversies over layoffs, new posting policies and temporary journalist bans, the billionaire issued a Twitter poll in the early hours of Monday morning, asking users “Should I step down as head of Twitter? I will abide by the results of this poll” As of the time of writing, the poll had already attracted more than 14 million votes, with around 57% voting for his resignation. The poll is set to close around 11am GMT, though it is not clear how quickly Musk would step down if the majority of voters call for his ousting. It is also unclear who would replace Musk as chief executive. He said in a separate tweet, Musk said: “No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.” Meanwhile, it’s relatively quiet on the economics front in the lead up to the Christmas weekend, with the CBI industrial trends survey for December due later this morning.

88,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-19,Elon Musk’s Twitter poll: 10 million say he should step down,"More than 10 million people have voted in favour of Elon Musk stepping down as the chief executive of Twitter in a poll he posted on the site late on Sunday. However, the billionaire, who bought the company and installed himself as its head only 50 days ago, has insisted there is no successor in the wings. “No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive,” he said on the social network. “There is no successor.” Replying to another user who said they could do the job, Musk added: “You must like pain a lot. One catch: you have to invest your life savings in Twitter and it has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy since May. Still want the job?” On Sunday, Musk asked Twitter users whether he should step down as the head of the company, promising to abide by the results of his poll. When the poll closed on Monday, 57.5% said he should step down. As the majority owner of the privately held company, no one can force Musk out, but a series of baffling decisions over the past few days has caused even some of his closest backers to break ties with him. A decision to ban an account that tracked the location of his private jet last week was followed by a mass suspension of critical journalists who reported on the ban. That led in turn to an exodus of some engaged users to other social networks, chiefly its decentralised competitor Mastodon, whose own account was banned for posting a link to the jet tracker’s account on the rival platform. On Sunday, Musk reacted by banning all links to other social networks, including Mastodon, Instagram, Facebook, and even minor platforms such as Nostr, used by the Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, and Linktree, a homepage creation tool favoured by influencers. That ban was rescinded by the end of the day, after a Twitter poll from the Twitter Safety account, with Musk saying: “Going forward, there will be a vote for major policy changes. My apologies. Won’t happen again.” However, the move was the final straw for some. Paul Graham, an Anglo-American venture capitalist who had only a month earlier backed Musk, saying: “It’s remarkable how many people who’ve never run any kind of company think they know how to run a tech company better than someone who’s run Tesla and SpaceX.” Graham also declared the move “the last straw” and told users they could find a link to his Mastodon profile on his personal website. His account was suspended for the post. Musk has a history of using Twitter polls to rubber-stamp major decisions, selling a tenth of his Tesla holdings after one poll in 2021, restoring Donald Trump’s account after a second last month and reinstating a number of suspended accounts after a third. “Vox Populi, Vox Dei,” Musk tweeted after the Trump poll. However, in many cases, he has given the impression of already having decided on the outcome before posting: he had already announced a sale of his Tesla holdings, for instance, long before he put it to a vote, and his plan to reinstate Trump had been discussed since before he even bought Twitter. The decision to step down as chief executive had also been hinted at long before the Twitter poll was published. On 16 November, he told a Delaware judge that he planned to reduce his time at Twitter and “find somebody else to run Twitter over time”. • This article was amended on 19 December 2022. The headline and introduction to an early version suggested Elon Musk had said he was stepping down as head of Twitter after the result of the poll; while he stated when initiating the poll that he would abide by its result, he has not made any announcement since. The article’s subheading was also amended to correctly refer to Musk as Tesla’s chief executive, not its founder.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/19/elon-musk-says-step-down-twitter-ceo-poll-tesla
89,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-18,Musk sets up Twitter poll asking if he should step down as head ,"Elon Musk has asked Twitter users whether he should step down as the head of the company, promising to abide by the results of his poll. Musk assumed the role of CEO at the end of October after firing a host of senior executives and dissolving its board of directors. Within minutes of posting the poll, more than one million people had voted. After 20 minutes of polling, when the yes vote gained a double-digit lead, Musk responded to a suggestion that he had already picked a new CEO, saying: “No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.” He also walked back the site’s latest policy controversy, after Twitter announced that it would remove accounts that offered “free promotion of certain social media platforms”. Musk said the policy would be adjusted to affect only accounts whose “primary purpose is promotion of competitors, which essentially falls under the no spam rule”. The platform earlier said the move would affect content from numerous social media websites, including Meta Platforms’ Facebook and Instagram, Mastodon, Truth Social, Tribel, Nostr and Post, but would allow cross-content posting. However, video platform TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, was not included in the list. The announcement came on Sunday – the same day that Musk tweeted photos from the Lusail Stadium in Qatar, where he watched Argentina beat France on penalties to win the men’s football World Cup. Musk attended the game alongside Jared Kushner, a former US presidential adviser and Donald Trump’s son-in-law. Trump’s Truth Social was among the platforms named in the Twitter linking ban. On the initial policy change, the Twitter Support account said: “We recognise that many of our users are active on other social media platforms. However, we will no longer allow free promotion of certain social media platforms on Twitter.” It gave examples of content that would be removed including “follow me @username on Instagram” and “check out my profile on Facebook – facebook.com/username”. It added: “We still allow cross-posting content from any social media platform. Posting links or usernames to social media platforms not listed above are also not in violation of this policy.” Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who recently invested in Nostr, replied to the Twitter support post with one word: “Why?” In a reply to another user posting about the Nostr promotion ban, Dorsey said it “doesn’t make sense”. Noam Bardin, the founder of Post, tweeted: “Just wanted to assure everyone that you can post any link you want on http://post.news. “We make it easy to add all your social media links to your profile since none of us only use one platform. Freedom = Choice.” He added: “In case I get kicked off this platform … So long and thanks for all the fish …” Last week, Twitter disbanded its Trust and Safety Council, a volunteer group formed in 2016 to advise the social media platform on site decisions. The policy change follows other contentious decisions at Twitter since Musk bought the social network in October, including sacking senior management and laying off about half of its workforce. A number of major advertisers left the platform over concerns about its direction. Musk, 51, also suspended the accounts of several journalists after a controversy over publishing public data about the movement of his private jet. He later reinstated the accounts after criticism from government officials, advocacy groups and journalism organisations. The billionaire, who was warned that he could face EU sanctions over his initial decision, asked Twitter users what he should do. Nearly 3.7 million people voted, 58.7% of whom said he should U-turn on the ban immediately, rather than in a week’s time. “The people have spoken. Accounts who doxxed my location will have their suspension lifted now,” he tweeted.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/18/twitter-to-remove-accounts-promoting-other-social-platforms
90,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-18,Go out in flames or fade away? Rightwing Twitter rant rekindles dilemma for ageing rockers,"The world of rock is a dangerous place to stay, with veteran musicians either damaged by the lifestyle or growing more out of touch with every passing year. This is the view of some of Britain’s well-known performers, responding to a rightwing Twitter rant from a one-time rock radical. The drummer Mick Harris, an original member of Napalm Death, launched an angry attack last week on “dole scroungers” and “benefit cheats” in a short video, full of crude language. This led to a lively online debate among 90s rockers about the best way for ageing musicians to tackle their senior years. Geoff Barrow, founder member of Portishead, and Sleaford Mods frontman Jason Williamson warned that the industry can be a destructive environment to work in for any length of time. Barrow said: “I think you’ve [got to] realise when you’ve had a good run and slide out the fire exit.” While rock rarely has direct links with party politics, many independent artists see a strong connection between their music and a liberal, if not socialist, outlook. Williamson, who has collaborated with Harris in the past, expressed shock at Harris’ views, saying: “The biggest killer in the music industry is not the corporates or Spotify, or conformity, or whatever. The biggest killer is not facing your own personal issues. It destroys all you initially gave, until all that’s left is you in a room on your own with nothing.” Harris, 55, was in at the birth of the “grindcore” sound in the 1980s with Napalm Death, originally famous for its ringtone-length songs and its left-leaning politics. The drummer left the band in 1991 and went on to work with Bill Laswell and release electronic and experimental music as Scorn, and then Lull. This is not the first time Williamson, 52, has had a run-in with Harris on the social media site. In May, Williamson claimed the problems between them began when he refused to work with Harris a second time – and then poked fun at his political transformation by comparing the bald and bearded man to Alf Garnett. Barrow, 51, was drawn into the row when he saw Williamson’s Twitter posts and the opinionated conversation thread that developed below them, involving several established talents. “I think anyone still doing any music related work in their 50s … are genuinely insane. And I know tons of them,” he wrote. “I don’t mean insane in a good or bad way, I mean it’s a tough ride to stay independent and survive as a musician for so many years without taking on a normal nine to five.” Artists “who’ve been in the business that long can kind of create their own universes and they become twisted when not challenged,” he added. “Especially successful artist[s]. I know a few who properly have some strange ideas but go unchallenged by the people around them because they are famous.” The cliche of the ageing rock star with reactionary views is older even than the surviving members of the Rolling Stones, but it is still unclear what direction formerly energetic and engaged musicians should take in their later years, whether they are rich or poor. Should they follow Neil Young’s view that it is “better to burn out”, or John Lennon’s advice to “fade away like an old soldier”? Lennon once railed against Young’s lyric from Rust Never Sleeps during an interview a few months before his death in which he imagined “another 40 years of productivity”. The problem is that for those who live on, there are so many more opportunities to disappoint. From Morrissey’s support of a far-right political party and Kanye West’s antisemitism, to Ian Brown’s Covid vaccination scepticism, plenty of fans have struggled to reconcile their love of music with a distaste for a star behind the sound. Today’s rock stars also find it harder to “fade away”. A 60s songwriter might have retired comfortably on the royalties from a few hits. But now even established performers need to keep up extra jobs. Harris himself works as a music technician, while Barrow writes scores for movies and TV series.",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/18/rightwing-twitter-rant-napalm-death-mick-harris-ageing-rockers
91,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-18,"Elon Musk is a Jekyll and Hyde character. And as head of Twitter, Hyde is winning | John Naughton","Watching what’s going on at Twitter is like watching a guy losing his mind in slow motion. The guy in question is Elon Musk, who once upon a time was the world’s richest man and now isn’t. (That slot is apparently occupied by Bernard Arnault, the luxury goods mogul.) Musk is in a hole but apparently doesn’t know Denis Healey’s First Law of Holes: when you’re in one, stop digging. The funny thing is that he dug the hole himself. First, he paid way over the odds for Twitter. Then, when Tesla shares (the main source of his wealth) tanked, and Twitter’s share price dropped, he tried to get out of the deal. That failed, so he was forced to borrow a lot of money – incurring interest payments of around a billion dollars a year – thereby becoming the reluctant owner of a loss-making company. And he hasn’t the faintest idea of how to make it work. So he’s thrashing around, doing one contradictory thing after another. He started by firing half of the staff, including quite a few key people who knew how hard it is to run a social media platform. He demanded that highly skilled software engineers print out their code on paper so that he could give it the once-over. He rescinded the bans that the company had imposed on legions of rightwing nutters and then discovered that many advertisers, who are the company’s main source of revenue, pulled out, anxious lest their corporate brands get tainted by proximity to lunacy, hate speech and white supremacist cant. He even rescinded the ban on Donald Trump, only to find that Trump was no longer interested in being on the platform. He took to sleeping on a sofa in Twitter’s San Francisco HQ, babbling about a “code red” crisis, the need to “clear the decks of any prior wrongdoing and move forward with a clean slate” and describing the company as a “crime scene”. To find some evidence for this, he commissioned two journalists to go through stacks of internal records of moderation decisions made long before he owned the company. Reports suggest that the documents merely show staff panicking about the radicalisation of the US right before and after the election and trying to react to events such as the storming of the Capitol building in Washington on 6 January 2021 – in other words, no smoking gun. And all the while, Musk has continued his maniacal tweeting. He tweeted a white rabbit, for example, which the QAnon crowd interpreted as a sign of support. He misread a blog post by the former head of trust and safety at Twitter and insinuated he was a paedophile, prompting others to label the man a “groomer”. (This chimed with his 2018 accusation that one of the team that rescued a group of children from a cave in Thailand was a “pedo guy”.) The other day, he tweeted that “My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci” – a multipurpose and daft insult revealing, among other things, that Musk doesn’t actually know how this “pronouns” business works. One could go on, but you get the point. The guy is flailing around and Twitter has become “The Musk Experience”, as the blogger Helen Lewis puts it. Meanwhile, the world’s media watch in morbid fascination. How can the world’s second richest man – the guy who transformed the automobile industry and built rockets that can deliver payloads into orbit and return to land accurately and safely on ocean-going rafts – be making such a mess of reforming a mere social media platform. After all, that doesn’t require rocket science, right? For the answer, we need look no further than Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Elon Musk is our contemporary gothic horror story. On the one hand, we have Dr Elon, a restless genius who transformed PayPal and used the proceeds to build two world-changing companies. Nobody who has seen him at work in these outfits doubts that he is fully on top of the technology and the business. Watch him on a tour of a SpaceX installation, for example, talking to the engineers who are building the kit and you see a CEO who really knows what he – and they – are doing. Likewise, ask him what’s special about the electric motors in the Tesla Model 3 or the Model S Plaid and you’re in for an interesting hour’s tutorial. In that sense, Dr Elon is the spiritual heir of Henry Ford, the genius who invented a new way of manufacturing complicated products at scale and, in doing so, changed the world. And then, on the other hand, we have Mr Musk, a narcissistic man-child with a pathetic craving for attention, the attention span of a newt and a maximalist interpretation of what is meant by “free speech”. This creature now controls a platform that plays a small but significant role in the global public sphere. Run properly and with a viable business model, Twitter could continue to play a useful role in our lives. But for that to happen, Dr Elon would have to be in charge. And at the moment he’s missing in action. • John Naughton chairs the advisory board of the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at Cambridge University Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

92,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-17,Elon Musk reinstates Twitter accounts of suspended journalists ,"Elon Musk has lifted the suspensions of the Twitter accounts of several journalists he had banned a day earlier, after the second poll he conducted on the topic went against his preferred outcome. On Thursday, Musk suspended a group of tech journalists from the website, including Ryan Mac from the New York Times, Drew Harwell of the Washington Post and CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan, for what he said were breaches of the company’s new rule about revealing people’s locations. After an initial poll supported an immediate reversal of the bans on Thursday, Musk said there were too many options, and ran another poll for 24 hours with just two options: to keep the ban in place for seven days, or lift the ban immediately. After close to 3.7m votes, users voted to lift the ban 58.7% to 41.3%. In a tweet shortly after, Musk said he would lift the bans, and several of those users returned to the platform. “The people have spoken,” Musk tweeted. The new rule bars users from publishing “live location information” that would “reveal a person’s location, regardless if this information is publicly available”. Musk claimed the journalists had “doxxed” him, but in fact they had recently published articles about Musk’s suspension of a Twitter account that had shared publicly available data about the movements of his private jet. The articles written by several of the reporters before their accounts were suspended did not include information about Musk’s real-time location, or the location of any of his family members. The ElonJet account that was dedicated to tweeting the location of his private jet remained suspended at the time of reporting. The suspension of the accounts of reporters who cover Musk was widely condemned by their employers, other media organisations, the EU and the United Nations. It was a chaotic 24 hours on Twitter even by the standard set by Musk since he took over the platform. In a Twitter Spaces event after the suspensions were announced, Musk briefly entered and was questioned by some of the journalists who had their accounts suspended, but were nevertheless able to participate in the Spaces event. He said journalists were not being treated differently to other citizens. “If you doxx, you get suspended. That’s it. End of story.” After further questioning from the host, BuzzFeed News tech reporter Katie Notopoulos, Musk left the event, and not long after the Space abruptly ended and was then deleted entirely by Twitter. Then Twitter took the entire Spaces product offline for almost a day, with Musk saying a “legacy bug” needed to be fixed. After it returned, Notopoulos found she had been banned from Spaces. Twitter also targeted its nearest rival, Mastodon, banning linking to several Mastodon servers and blocking users from adding their Mastodon username to their profile.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/17/elon-musk-reinstates-twitter-accounts-of-suspended-journalists

The video was uploaded on Monday night on a now-deleted YouTube account as well as another online conspiracy site. The prime minister is urging media outlets not to publish the video. “This is a shocking and devastating crime and I would encourage media outlets and others do not publish in any way such material that I have not seen and are not aware of the nature of,” Anthony Albanese said. The video is the latest disturbing revelation as details continue to surface surrounding the ambush, and the lives of the three shooters.

94,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-16,Twitter suspends accounts of several journalists who had reported on Elon Musk,"A number of prominent journalists who have reported on Twitter and its new chief executive, Elon Musk, appear to have been suspended or banned from the platform. In a series of evening tweets, Musk wrote that sharing his real-time location on Twitter was forbidden, and accused journalists who he alleged had been sharing information about his location of posting “assassination coordinates”. Accounts of tech journalists at CNN, the Washington Post, Mashable and the New York Times were suspended in quick succession on Thursday evening. All had recently published articles about Musk’s suspension of a Twitter account that had shared publicly available data about the movements of his private jet. Each of these articles had highlighted the tension between Musk’s stated commitment to “free speech” and his choice to ban an account that he personally disliked. The Twitter account for rival social media company, Mastodon – which some Twitter users have migrated to after Musk’s takeover of Twitter – also appeared to have been suspended. Links to individual Mastodon accounts also appeared to be banned. An error message notified some users that links to Mastodon had been “identified” as “potentially harmful” by Twitter or its partners. Ryan Mac, a New York Times tech reporter, wrote on a new Twitter account that he was given “no warning” before his account was suspended and that he had received no communication from the company about the reason his account was “permanently suspended”. The Washington Post said in a statement that the suspension of their technology reporter, Drew Harwell, “undermines Elon Musk’s claim that he intends to run Twitter as a platform dedicated to free speech”. CNN said in its statement: “Twitter’s increasing instability and volatility should be of incredible concern to everyone who uses the platform.” “Musk just seems to be stamping out accounts that he doesn’t like,” Donie O’Sullivan, one of the journalists whose account was abruptly suspended, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. The Committee to Protect Journalists said that if individual’s bans were confirmed as retaliation for journalists’ work, it would be a “serious violation of journalists’ right to report the news without fear of reprisal”. In a series of late-night tweets on Thursday, Musk said: “Criticizing me all day long is totally fine, but doxxing my real-time location and endangering my family is not.” He added that the “same doxxing rules apply to ‘journalists’ as to everyone else” and wrote: “They posted my exact real-time location, basically assassination coordinates, in (obvious) direct violation of Twitter terms of service.” Musk did not clarify in what way he believed the reporters who were suspended had shared his “exact real-time location”. The news articles about Musk that several reporters had published before their accounts were suspended did not include any information about his real-time location, or the location of any of his family members. The articles were focused on ElonJet, an account that had posted the location of the billionaire’s private jet as it travelled to different cities. In a Twitter spaces event, Musk was questioned about the bans by some of the journalists who had their accounts suspended. Musk said journalists were not being treated differently to other citizens, and “if you doxx, you get suspended. That’s it. End of story.” While the journalists had reported that the suspensions were permanent, in multiple tweets Musk said the suspensions would be for only seven days. “Some time away from Twitter is good for the soul …” Musk tweeted. He subsequently tweeted a poll asking people whether the ban should be lifted now, tomorrow, in seven days or longer. The poll went in favour of immediately unbanning the users, with 43% of the over half a million votes going with “now”. Musk then tweeted that he would redo the poll because there were too many options, narrowing it to now or in seven days. It is similar to the poll launched by Musk that resulted in former US president Donald Trump being unbanned from the platform. At least two of the reporters whose accounts were suspended had reportedly tweeted about a public statement from the Los Angeles police department, responding to an allegation Musk had made about an incident in LA in which he said a stalker had targeted a car, believing it was his. Donie O’Sullivan, the CNN reporter whose account was suspended, is one of the country’s leading reporters on conspiracy theories and disinformation, and had shared a comment from the LAPD about Musk shortly before he was suspended. Matt Binder, the Mashable reporter whose account was suspended, “was tweeting about O’Sullivan’s suspension when his account also went dark”, the Washington Post reported. Twitter, which recently dissolved the majority of its press department, did not immediately respond to request for comment. But Twitter’s head of trust and safety told the Verge: “Without commenting on any specific accounts, I can confirm that we will suspend any accounts that violate our privacy policies and put other users at risk.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/15/twitter-suspends-accounts-journalists-musk
95,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-15,Twitter suspends account monitoring Elon Musk’s flight paths,"Twitter on Wednesday suspended an account that monitors the flight paths of a private jet owned by the social media giant’s new boss, Elon Musk. Later that evening, the account, @ElonJet, confirmed via tweet it was back online after being suspended for “violat[ing ] Twitter rules”. An hour later, Musk again suspended the jet-tracking account after imposing new conditions on all of Twitter’s users that the sharing of anyone’s current location was not allowed. The account is run by Jack Sweeney, a Florida college student and aviation enthusiast who ran similar “bot” accounts tracking other celebrities’ airplanes. For hours after the suspension of the @elonjet account, other Sweeney-run accounts tracking private jets used by Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and various Russian oligarchs were still live on Twitter. But by later on Wednesday, Twitter suspended all of them, including Sweeney’s personal account. He also operates accounts tracking Musk’s jet on rival social platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, the account also began tracking the flight paths of various Russian oligarchs. The decision to suspend the account underscored concerns about the new Twitter CEO’s unilateral control over content decisions on the platform. On 7 November, shortly after acquiring Twitter for $44bn, Musk tweeted: “My commitment to free speech extends even to not banning the account following my plane, even though that is a direct personal safety risk.” But on Wednesday morning, Sweeney tweeted: “Well, it appears @ElonJet is suspended.” He also tweeted a screenshot of a Twitter message that read: “After careful review, we determined your account broke the Twitter Rules. Your account is permanently in read-only mode, which means you can’t Tweet, Retweet, or Like content. You won’t be able to create new accounts.” Twitter, which under Musk has dissolved much of its media department, did not respond to a request for comment. Over the weekend, Sweeney tweeted that his account had been shadowbanned, meaning that its visibility had been deliberately reduced. “Internal messages obtained by a[n] anonymous Twitter employee explained to me that on ‘2 Dec[ember] 2022 your account @elonjet was visibility limited/restricted to a severe degree internally,’” Sweeney wrote. He then included a screenshot that allegedly showed Ella Irwin, vice-president of Twitter’s trust and safety council, asking her team to apply “heavy VF [visibility filtering] to @elonjet immediately”. The trust and safety council was dissolved on Monday. The same day, Sweeney tweeted that it appeared @ElonJet was no longer banned or hidden. On Wednesday, Sweeney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When Musk discovered the @ElonJet account, earlier this year, he asked Sweeney to delete it. “Can you take this down? It is a security risk,” he wrote to Sweeney, adding: “I don’t love the idea of being shot by a nutcase.” In February, Sweeney told the Guardian: “And then he offers me $5,000 to make it harder for people to track him and to take down the account, and I make my counter-offer.” Sweeney replied: “Any chance to up that to $50K?

96,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-13,Twitter office oddities go up for auction – from bird statues to rotisserie ovens,"Great news, holiday shoppers: you can finally get your hands on a 100% authentic, 3ft-tall statue of the Twitter bird. An online auction next month will feature hundreds of the company’s “surplus corporate office assets” that could add a certain je ne sais quoi to any home or workplace, from bizarre decor to high-end cooking equipment. The sale comes amid Elon Musk’s chaotic $44bn takeover of the company, which has brought rapid-fire policy changes (and immediate U-turns), the reinstatement of banned accounts, and, according to Musk himself, a huge dip in advertising revenue. It’s also involved shedding thousands of jobs – and now, apparently, shedding office furniture. A representative for the auctioneers, Heritage Global Partners, told Fortune that the auction “has nothing to do with their financial position”, adding: “If anyone genuinely thinks that the revenue from selling a couple computers and chairs will pay for the mountain there, then they’re a moron.” Regardless of the reason, it’s hard not to see the auction as symbolic of a tech industry shift: from the heady days of the early 2000s, when endlessly wealthy platforms catered to workers’ every whim, to a more uncertain modern era. Somehow, that industrial cheese slicer just doesn’t feel as necessary as it once did. Here’s a guide to the sale’s most memorable items, in case you’re still looking for that perfect gift: A 6ft-tall planter in the shape of the @ symbol. Sure to be a hit with the tech-obsessed gardener in your life, this piece marries the ancient art of horticulture with a ubiquitous symbol of decaying public discourse. Expect heads to turn when you install this in front of your home, announcing to passersby that you have no soul. A “high-performance task chair”. Nothing says high-performance like sitting down. Turn workaday programming into X-treme coding with this seat, which uses the latest in sedentary technology to shield your thighs and buttocks from direct contact with the floor. It’s surprising Musk is willing to part with this at a time when his priorities are “extremely hardcore”. Kegerators. A house isn’t a home without a fridge that dispenses beer. And a workplace isn’t a workplace if you can’t drink on the job. Imagine channeling your fluids through the same tubes that might once have lubricated the likes of the Twitter co-founders Jack Dorsey and Christopher Isaac “Biz” Stone. A rotisserie oven with 24 spits. Who could forget those late nights at the office, rustling up a snack of 24 whole chickens while sifting through hate speech? Pairs perfectly with a 20-gallon vegetable dryer. An old iMac. This computer might be out of date, but in a courageous act of corporate one-upmanship, someone stuck a Twitter sticker over the Apple logo. So that’s pretty cool. And just think – this computer might have been the one used to ban Donald Trump! That’s the best of what’s on offer for now, but stay tuned – the next Twitter-auction drop might feature everything you need for a “modest bedroom”.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/13/twitter-hq-office-auction-items
97,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-13,TechScape: I read Elon Musk’s ‘Twitter Files’ so you don’t have to,"The threat model of a social network is complex. Your security team has to deal with conventional hacking attacks, as hostile actors probe for technical errors in your apps and servers that they can use to extract valuable private data, inject malicious code, or simply wreak havoc for fun. They also have to deal with people using the site’s own capabilities in destructive ways, from simple-minded spam bots through to nation states carrying out “coordinated inauthentic behaviour”. They have to protect users from account takeovers due to password theft, and they have to do it all while navigating the minefield that is content moderation. And then the site gets bought on a whim by a capricious billionaire and the threat comes from inside the house. What are the Twitter Files? Elon Musk has been pushing “the Twitter Files”, a series of Twitter threads from friendly journalists using material provided by the company to re-litigate the company’s role in the culture wars of years past. Typically, big news stories claiming to be the [something] “files” are based on enormous leaks, providing a hitherto impossible look at the inner workings of the organisation under the microscope. It is less typical for an enormous leak to have been ordered by the chief executive of the company, and executed by their subordinates openly working with the journalists reporting on the story. But little about Elon Musk’s Twitter is typical. What of the files themselves? A week and a half in, there have been four releases, from three writers: Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss and Michael Shellenberger, all broadly part of a wave of “post-liberal” Substack newsletter writers. It’s unclear how they were selected to receive the documents. One requirement, however, was that everything they published be shared on Twitter itself, Taibbi has said, but beyond that “we’ve been encouraged to look not just at historical Twitter, but the current iteration as well. I was told flat-out I could write anything I wanted, including anything about the current company and its new chief, Elon Musk.” At the same time, the reporting was done inside Twitter’s offices, with the assistance of Twitter staff. And all three have focused on the areas that one might guess, given their previous statements about the social network. Taibbi’s first thread covered Twitter’s efforts to respond to the New York Post’s story about Hunter Biden’s laptop; his second thread, as well as Shellenberger’s, looked at the events around the suspension of Donald Trump and the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Weiss, meanwhile, reported on what she described as “Twitter’s secret blacklists”.‌ Freedom of speech v ‘freedom of reach’ The bulk of the material so far, then, has been focused on what are effectively two extremely high-stakes individual moderation decisions, one widely regarded as an error in hindsight (hiding stories about Biden’s laptop), and the other exactly as divisive as anyone would have guessed beforehand (Trump’s ban). The documents shared by Taibbi and Shellenberger largely support that reading. Shorn of the conspiratorial framing of the two writers, the excerpts of internal emails and chat messages that they have posted appear to show staff tackling the enormous burden that has been placed on them with a rough mixture of panic and resolve. In the days following the publication of the Post’s story on Hunter Biden, that wasn’t enough. The executives quoted by Taibbi are clearly aware of the prospect of a repeat of 2016’s WikiLeaks dump of hacked Democratic Party documents, and move quickly to discuss enforcing a policy against sharing hacked materials. But the materials weren’t hacked, and while the chain of custody of Biden’s laptop remains murky, it rapidly became clear that the policy was wrongly applied. Twitter’s most senior staff were too slow removing the ban as that became clear, and, in Taibbi’s words, “erred on the side of … continuing to err”. Just two months later, the same group was convened to discuss Donald Trump. The president had used social media to egg on a protest in Washington DC that turned violent as his supporters decided to storm the US Capitol building. In the days since the election, Twitter had been aggressively applying its “newsworthiness” policy, slapping a label on posts that would be deleted were it not for the prominence of their author, but by 7 January, it was clear that was unsatisfactory in the case of Trump. A series of Slack posts shared by Shellenberger show the team, led by former trust and safety head Yoel Roth, desperately trying to invent policy on the fly (all staff except Roth are anonymised in the posts Shellenberger shared). Trump had been given special treatment, left on the site for months after a typical user would have seen his account deleted: at what point does that approach cease to be viable? The answer was clearly January 6. But if you give someone special treatment without admitting as such, it just makes it all the more difficult to take it away. Weiss’s part of the saga is different. Rather than focusing on the narrow world of US electoral politics, her thread takes a more systemic look at Twitter’s moderation practices. Working with Ella Irwin, a trust and safety staffer at Twitter, Weiss published screenshots of the moderation pages for some of the site’s most notorious users. Jay Bhattacharya, a Covid sceptic, was placed on a “trends blacklist”; Dan Bongino, a rightwing media personality, on a “search blacklist”; Charlie Kirk, whose decision to attend a protest wearing a diaper caused such secondhand embarrassment it effectively destroyed the Republican youth movement he founded, was set to “do not amplify”. The tags are various examples of what Twitter calls “visibility filtering”, a form of moderation that is intended to impact “freedom of reach” without affecting “freedom of speech”. Users who are filtered can post what they like, but their involvement in the algorithmic amplification of the site is limited. Some won’t show up in search results or trends; others won’t be recommended to users to follow. The most aggressive form of visibility filtering, which didn’t affect any of the prominent accounts Weiss highlighted, means that new posts won’t even show up for followers, and are only visible to people who navigate directly to the poster’s profile. Not every user Weiss examined was hurt by the moderation. One, LibsofTikTok, was given special treatment, warning moderators to do nothing to it without consulting the site’s senior team. Despite that, it had still received two strikes for abuse, and been placed on the trends blacklist. What did we learn? I think it’s important to distinguish between the Twitter files, and the “Twitter Files”. The latter, a big, hyped, coordinated publication, has so far failed to achieve its apparent goals. The throughline of the whole exercise is that Twitter is a hotbed of leftwing bias, explicitly aligned with the US Democratic party, and taking unwarranted action to censor speech for politically motivated purposes. The posts themselves show little of the sort. Some, like Weiss’s, don’t even attempt to: individual examples of rightwing users being on the end of light-touch moderation says little about overall bias. Were leftwing users also given visibility filters? Weiss doesn’t say. Were rightwing users given filters more? Weiss doesn’t say. Others show almost the opposite. There were plenty of easy reasons to remove Donald Trump from the social network in January 2021, but the posts seem to reveal Twitter staff methodically working through their actual rulebook, trying to understand how to react to unprecedented events in a way that doesn’t simply throw precedent out the window. Like so much to do with American politics, the Files fall flat if you view the American right as an outlier. If you have rules against election misinformation and only one party engages in a systematic campaign of election misinformation, it’s not an unreasonable outcome for one party to be the focus of moderation efforts. But the lowercase files, the documents themselves, are an interesting historical artefact nonetheless. They show that, at periods of global crisis, the people making the decisions inside Twitter were acutely aware of, and uncomfortable with, the power they held. Even as a set of cherrypicked examples, they show that efforts to create and apply a consistent rulebook were driven as much by a desire to avoid criticism as a belief that doing so was important for protecting users. They give us an insight into the sorts of discussions that were likely happening at Facebook and YouTube at the same time. And they show us never to trust Elon Musk. Insider threat Musk has been promoting the series as an exercise in “transparency”, and, if you’re Weiss, Taibbi or Shellenberger, that’s what it is. But it’s the sort of transparency that companies get when their database is hacked and sold on the darknet. In this case, the database cost $44bn, and came with control of the site to boot. Marcus Hutchins, the ethical hacker who stopped the WannaCry ransomware infection, posted on Mastodon about the docs. “As a security professional, not much scares me,” he said. “I’ve seen my personal data stolen numerous times, watched nationstate hackers spray zerodays across the internet, and I’m a shameless user of TikTok. “But now you have someone sitting on top of the personal data of several billion users, someone who has a long track record of vindictive harassment, someone who has the ear of the far right, and someone who has just shown us his willingness to weaponise internal company data to score political points. That scares me a lot.” The Shellenberger posts named only one person: Twitter’s former head of trust and safety Yael Roth. When Musk bought the company, Roth was initially welcoming: one of the few staffers who was prepared to advocate for his boss publicly, and a much-needed source of internal expertise after the immediate sacking of Vijaya Gadde, the longtime head of Twitter’s platform safety efforts. But the relationship clearly soured. On 10 November, Roth quit, resurfacing a week later to write a New York Times post arguing that “even as he criticizes the capriciousness of platform policies, [Musk] perpetuates the same lack of legitimacy through his impulsive changes and tweet-length pronouncements about Twitter’s rules.” In doing so, he seems to have become a bete noire for his brief boss, and so for the wider rightwing media ecosystem that Musk now conducts. The day before Shellenberger shared his part of the Twitter Files, Musk posted an out-of-context excerpt of Roth’s decades-old PhD thesis, which looked at whether services like Grindr were causing harm by forcing teenagers to pretend to be adults in order to access dating sites. To an audience of hundreds of millions, Musk accused Roth of being “in favour of children being able to access adult internet services”, and indirectly accused him of personally deciding to make Twitter a safe space for paedophiles. The accusation is nonsense, but the charge, in an atmosphere of rightwing panic over “groomers” in the media, is life-changing. On Monday, Roth and his partner were forced to flee their home after a sharp increase in credible threats against him. For insufficient loyalty, he will have to spend the rest of his life checking over his shoulder. What will happen to the next person who annoys Elon?

98,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-13,Twitter ‘to lose 32m users in two years after Elon Musk takeover’,"More than 30 million users are expected to leave Twitter over the next two years as concerns mount over technical issues and the proliferation of offensive content after Elon Musk’s $44bn takeover, according to a forecast. The number of global monthly users is predicted to fall by nearly 4% next year and 5% in 2024 – more than 32 million in total – in the first annual declines forecast by the market research agency Insider Intelligence since it began tracking the social media platform in 2008. “There won’t be one catastrophic event that ends Twitter,” a principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, Jasmine Enberg, said. “Instead, users will start to leave the platform next year as they grow frustrated with technical issues and the proliferation of hateful or other unsavoury content. “Twitter’s skeleton staff, working around the clock, won’t be able to counteract the platform’s infrastructure and content moderation problems.” Its report anticipates that Twitter will lose more users in the US, its biggest market, than any other country, with numbers declining 8.2 million over the next two years. By the end of 2024, US user numbers are forecast to fall to 50.5 million, the lowest level since 2014, as the Twitter becomes “more unstable, and less pleasant”. In the UK, Twitter will lose about 1.6 million users over the next two years, to a base of 12.6 million, Insider Intelligence said. It predicts that while disillusioned users leaving the platform will occur across all age demographics, the biggest concentration of departers will come from the under-25 and over-45 age groups, which “aren’t as loyal and are less willing to tolerate a degrading experience”. Insider Intelligence has also slashed its forecast for ad revenue growth for Twitter from 22% in 2023 and 16% in 2024 to “essentially flat”, as advertisers pull back, pause or stop advertising over growing brand safety concerns on the platform. In November, the research company cut its outlook for Twitter’s ad revenue growth by 40% this year. “Musk’s primary focus in 2023 will be kickstarting Twitter’s revenue engine, after losing many of its biggest advertisers and a long tail of other advertisers who have been quietly quitting the platform,” it said. On Monday, Twitter abruptly dissolved its trust and safety council, an advisory group of nearly 100 independent civil, human rights and other organisations that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech, child exploitation, suicide, self-harm and other problems on the platform, moments before a meeting scheduled with the company. The unpopularity of the takeover by Musk, who has fired thousands of employees and told those remaining they had to work long hours at high intensity, was summed up when the world’s richest man received a 10-minute chorus of booing from a crowd of 18,000 when he joined the comedian Dave Chappelle on stage in San Francisco on Sunday night.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/13/twitter-lose-users-elon-musk-takeover-hate-speech
99,twitter,Guardian,2022-12-13,Twitter abruptly dissolves safety council moments before meeting,"Elon Musk’s Twitter abruptly dissolved its Trust and Safety Council on Monday night, just moments before it was scheduled to meet with company representatives. The council was an advisory group of nearly 100 independent civil, human rights and other organizations that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech, child exploitation, suicide, self-harm and other problems on the platform. But Twitter informed the group via email that it was disbanding shortly before the meeting was to take place on Monday, according to multiple members. The council members, who provided to the Associated Press and other outlets images of the email from Twitter, spoke on the condition of anonymity due to fears of retaliation. “Our work to make Twitter a safe, informative place will be moving faster and more aggressively than ever before and we will continue to welcome your ideas going forward about how to achieve this goal,” said the email, which was signed “Twitter.” The news appeared to deepen the turmoil that has beset the company following Musk’s takeover. Also on Monday, it was reported that Twitter’s former top safety official, Yoel Roth, was forced to flee his home amid escalating personal attacks, including from Musk himself. Outlets including the Washington Post and CNN reported on Monday that Roth and his family fled after Musk’s tweets misrepresented Roth’s academic writing about sexual activity and children. As head of trust and safety at Twitter, Roth was involved in many of the platform’s decisions about what posts to remove and what accounts to suspend. His communications with other Twitter officials have been posted in recent days as part of what Musk has dubbed “the Twitter files,” a series of internal documents that Musk has shared and disseminated on the platform via journalists including Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss. Musk’s tweets to his tens of millions of followers have for years prompted his supporters to deluge the targets of his ire with online threats – famously, a participant in the rescue of a boys soccer team trapped in a cave in Thailand who Musk branded “pedo guy.” But now that Musk owns one of the most powerful social networks in the world and has gutted the division that previously policed online harassment, the stakes are even higher. Musk’s recent condemnation of Anthony Fauci, the top US health official, has also drawn rebuke. Musk over the weekend tweeted: “My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci.” Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, called Musks’ comment “dangerous” and “disgusting” in a press briefing on Monday. “They are disgusting, and they are divorced from reality, and we will continue to call that out and be very clear about that,” Jean-Pierre said on Monday. She praised Fauci’s handling of public heath crises, including the coronavirus pandemic. Fauci, who said he planned to retire in December as Joe Biden’s top medical adviser, has dealt with the thorny questions around health crises from HIV/AIDS to avian flu and Ebola, and has served as an adviser to seven presidents. Fauci has said he has faced death threats. He has endured criticism from Trump and various conservatives who objected to safeguards such as vaccination, social distancing and masking that he advocated to try to limit the lethality of the Covid-19 pandemic.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/12/twitter-safety-council-dissolved-before-meeting
