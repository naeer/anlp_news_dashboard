0,"Queensland-based company, Transportable Shade Sheds, has gone bankrupt, leaving many of its customers and workers out of pocket. The company, which was founded in 2002, owed over $1.3 million to 160 creditors and trade suppliers. The liquidator will not continue the company's operations. The company's director, Robert Salomon, is under investigation, and the company's assets are being sold to pay its debts. Customers have vented their frustration on social media, and some have joined a Facebook group to seek help. The liquidator has advised creditors to submit a Proof of Debt form to register their claim.","A shed supplier on the Sunshine Coast has become the latest casualty to join a spate of companies in the sector which have gone bankrupt in recent months.
Mooloolaba-based business Transportable Shade Sheds has left dozens of Australians out-of-pocket and have failed to pay their workersâ leave entitlements after going into liquidation on April 3.
The failed company is now under external administration and owes more than $1.3 million to about 160 trade suppliers and creditors.
Bill Cotter of Robson Cotter Insolvency Group was appointed liquidator of the company following its collapse.
There are an additional five other companies set up as a group of related entities which have also ceased trading including Vanquish Holdings Pty Ltd, Bend Tube Designs Pty Ltd, Sable Labour Hire Pty Ltd, Tochlo Pty Ltd and TSS Dealers Pty Ltd. 
âThe businesses had ceased to trade shortly prior to the date of liquidation,â a statement from the liquidators read on its website. 
âThe Liquidator will not be trading-on the business operations of the companies during the liquidation process.â
An investigation into the cause of the companies failures is now underway, with the insolvency group currently âsecuring and realisingâ the assets.
Robson Cotter from the independent boutique advisory firm told the Courier Mail there were dozens of customers who had received partial or fully incomplete orders at the time the company went broke.
âThe amount potentially owing to customers with partially or fully incomplete orders delivered is currently unquantified,â he said.
Mr Cotter added several staff from the company were owed money for leave entitlements and superannuation.
Robert Salomon is understood to be the company director of Transportable Shade Sheds which was founded just over two decades ago in 2002.
Mr Salomon built the ânationally recognised company with international aspirationsâ alongside his partner Kylie, which offered a number of easy installation sheds, quickshades and canvacons.
âWe supply our Shade Sheds as a pre-engineered kit that has been designed for anyone to erect. So, no welding or technical knowledge is required,â the company explained on its website.
âWe swage the frames for you and with our slip fit connection system, it is just a matter of simply joining them together!â
The companyâs website remains active despite its insolvency with customers still able to make inquiries to order products.
As for its social media pages, there were little signs to show the company was struggling, with the last post made to the Transportable Shade Sheds (TSS) Instagram and Facebook accounts asking customers to send a picture of their installed purchase.
âHappy Friday! Check out this awesome shot from one of our customers! Have you got any photos of Your Shade Shed? Weâd love to see them,â the post is captioned.
âWe hope you all have a nice weekend!â
Customers who have been impacted by the companyâs closure have resorted to a Facebook group to vent their frustrations about the lack of notice they were given to suggest the company had gone bust. 
One loyal customer who has purchased seven sheds from the company said she ordered two sheds in June last year and paid the deposit only to never receive the products.
âIâm devastated, angry and canât wait for karma and the legal system to catch up with them so they can pay with what they have done to us and other families, including staff,â she wrote.
âThey chased us in the last two weeks for the balance of $15,000 and we refused to pay till the sheds were delivered to our premises in good order first. 
âIâm so glad we never paid them the extra money and now we have to see how we get our deposit back as we worked extremely hard for the money just like everyone else that got scammed by TSS.â 
Meanwhile one Victorian customer was left with the framework and anchors of a shed after he failed to receive its panels.
âI was told when the original framework was out for shipping, that the suppliers of the panels (are) state specific. Wondering if they are laying at a factory or depot somewhere in Victoria,â he said. 
âI really feel for those who have spent the money with zero to show for.â
A third person who claims they were a dealer and reseller for the company said he now has to find $90,000 to refund customer deposits for sheds âthey are not going to getâ. 
âItâs going to put me close to the edge, but I should hopefully just be able to keep my head above water after I have refunded my customers,â he said.
âAt least my customers will get every cent back whereas there must be hundreds, if not thousands of people around Australia that bought directly through them and will not get a penny back, I feel for them.â
The insolvency group recommends affected customers and creditors to submit a Proof of Debt form to register their claim via its email â admin@rcinsol.com.au.

1,"Sydney-based fashion brand Babyboo, founded by Argylica Conditsis when she was 17, is now worth $60m, with customers in almost 150 countries and a team of 40 employees. Conditsis started the business by investing $1,000 she saved from her part-time job at Pizza Hut. She initially sold bedazzled shoes before expanding to clothing. Babyboo pivoted to loungewear during Covid lockdowns, which saw sales boom. The company now plans to expand internationally further, launch new collections and move into a new office and warehouse.","At just 17 years old, fashion-loving Argylica Conditsis took $1000 she had saved from her part-time Pizza Hut job and invested it in her âhobbyâ.
The Sydney teen had a âcrazy ideaâ to sell statement shoes, and began listing them online after embellishing and bedazzling them herself back in 2011.
They were an instant hit â and just 12 years later, her Babyboo Fashion brand has gone from a gamble that began in her bedroom to a growing fashion empire valued at a staggering $60 million.
Itâs not a bad achievement for a young woman who is yet to see her 30th birthday.
âIt has been a bit of a roller coaster after starting when I was really young â I had just finished high school and was on holidays between school and uni when we started,â she told news.com.au.
âI had been working late night and weekend shifts at Pizza Hut during school and making something like $6 an hour, so saving $1000 was a lot for me back then, and I put it all into stock.
âIt was definitely not supposed to be a business â it was just a hobby, but when we first put the shoes online they went viral. I popped them on a Facebook page and it kind of evolved naturally over time.â
Ms Conditsisâ brother William has been with her every step of the way, and she eventually âstole himâ out of uni to work on the business full time, after also dropping out of her own Visual Communications degree to focus on building up the brand. 
Within three years of launching the online business, the pair decided to expand into clothing, and after initially running Babyboo out of Ms Conditsisâ bedroom and taking over âevery inchâ of her parentsâ Baulkham Hills home, it was soon time to expand into a proper warehouse and office.
Today, Babyboo has customers in almost 150 countries around the globe, a team of more than 40 employees and 1.1 million Instagram followers.
Ms Conditsis said one of her secrets to success was really understanding her customers from day one.
âI started bedazzling shoes myself because there were just no products like them out there â¦ I always liked to be the one that stood out with outfits and I realised weâd have to start (making them) ourselves as there was a gap in the market,â she explained.
âIf youâd told me back then weâd be as big as we are today I would have laughed at you â thereâs no way I would have believed it and it is now so much bigger than I ever imagined.
âWe never had a business plan or goal and each year that the business would double would come as a surprise.
âNow itâs more of a structured business with processes and strategies but in the early days it was all trial and error and learning from our mistakes quickly.â
The now-29-year-old said it was a blessing to work so closely with her brother.
âIt has been great to join forces with him â weâre so alike, but have our own strengths and weaknesses that work well together,â she said.
âWill is really good at understanding operations and processes and is very creative as well, and I focus more on the product, brand and social side of things.â
She said the biggest achievement for her personally was building a business from âabsolutely nothingâ with no financial backing to one now valued at $60 million, which has also allowed her to build up a team and community of women who âshare the same passionâ.
âWe empower a lot of women around the world by making them feel good, weâre with hundreds of thousands of women worldwide for all their special occasions,â she said.
âDressing them and making them feel empowered is what gets me up every morning â itâs not just a business, it actually serves a purpose.â
However, it hasnât all been smooth sailing.
Like most retailers, Babyboo took a hit during the Covid pandemic, but was able to quickly pivot and expand into loungewear, which was soon snapped up by those living through brutal lockdowns.
The move saw sales boom â and now, the next step for the thriving business is continuing its international expansion, settling into a new office and warehouse and launching new collections to increase the offering for customers. 
When it comes to advice for other budding young entrepreneurs, Ms Conditsis said it was simple.
âI always say never compare your chapter one to someone elseâs chapter six â eventually, youâll get there, after going through a process of evolving and learning,â she said.
âWhen I was young, there were a lot of people who didnât take me seriously and I got a lot of nos, but I think most of the businesses that will rise in the coming years will be from young people, who are very in tune with social media and have a lot to offer.â",news.com.au,2023-04-21T08:33:59Z,How Argylica Conditsis turned Babyboo Fashion into $60m empire,https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/sydney-woman-turns-1000-pizza-hut-earnings-into-60-million-fashion-empire-in-just-12-years/news-story/b2f4af56e67430fac8a4c5a1f3ce66b6
2,"The Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ) released a weekly quiz on its Facebook page, asking Australian motorists when they should indicate when using a roundabout. The quiz provided four options, and the correct answer is option B, which is to indicate right on approach and driving in the roundabout and indicate left when leaving.

While the majority of the respondents answered correctly, many commented that most drivers don't indicate correctly or at all. Some drivers even indicate right to go straight ahead, which is incorrect.

The girl's father, who was nearby, shouted angrily at the driver and hit the car. Users on Facebook criticized the father for not controlling his child and defended the driver's actions. Some suggested both parties had a degree of responsibility, and others empathized with both sides, saying that incidents like this could have long-lasting psychological effects.","Terrifying dashcam footage has captured the moment a driver slams on the brakes as a young girl darts in front of his car on a Melbourne street.
âLuckily this driver was alert or this could have ended in tragedy,â wrote the Dash Cam Owners Australia Facebook page.
The video, which was filmed last Thursday afternoon, shows a young girl in pink pants dashing out from behind a parked car into the middle of the narrow street.
A man, presumably her father, has his back turned and appears to be doing some work on the house, which has a ladder propped up against the fence.
The driver slams on the brakes and the car screeches to a halt but still collides with the girl, bowling her to the ground as she tumbles over.
The man yells angrily and smashes his fist on the carâs bonnet before running to pick up the screaming girl, continuing to hurl abuse at the driver.
âSheâs alright? Sheâs alright?â the driver asks.
Victoria Police has been contacted for comment.

âThe driver showed more patience than I would have. Glad the child is not hurt, but Iâd be having a hard chat with dad later about his attitude and adjusting it accordingly,â another said.

âGood driving to hit the brakes so quick, donât know why the father would hit the car but he should be thanking the driver,â one person agreed.
But some argued it was a natural reaction.
âWow. So much judgment here. Until youâre in either position you have no right to judge. All parties will have PTSD from this incident if my experience is representative.

6,"Locals in Southern Tasmania witnessed a spectacular Aurora Australis, or Southern Lights, display, with colorful beams visible to the naked eye. Photographers and aurora chasers flooded social media with stunning images of the event, which is caused by energetic charged particles colliding with gases in the upper atmosphere. The lights are most visible in Australia and New Zealand's southern areas during this time of year, but they can occur at any time. Another aurora is expected in Australia's far south early Tuesday morning.","Southern Tasmanian locals have flooded social media today with what has been described as the best Aurora Australis (aka Southern Lights) display âeverâ. 
Experts say youâll be able to see the lights from Tasmania and coastal parts of Victoria tonight, but it looks to be weaker.
Tassie is no stranger to the light event though they are usually faint and hard to spot without the aid of a long exposure photograph.
But this morning around 5.15am the display put on a show, with colourful beams reportedly visible to the naked eye. 
Toby Schrapel, a freelance photographer from The Huon Valley, 40 minutes south of Hobart, described the moment he and his son saw the rare event. 
âWe could see full colour to the naked eye â not quite like what the camera sees, but it was the most colour (Iâve) ever seen,â he said. 
He had been camping with his son in the valley when it happened, and they were both blown away by the southern lights. 
âHarlan then told me âThis is so special to see the magic sky colours with you daddyâ â So Iâm never forgetting this one,â he said. 
âMay have started another aurora chaser.â
A Tasmanian Facebook group dedicated to snapping and forecasting the event when it comes around was bombarded today by incredible pictures and accounts. 
âIt was amazing to see beams and movement last night visible to the naked eye,â one aurora chaser wrote. 
âAbsolutely insane show tonight,â another wrote. 
Auroras, also known as the Northern and Southern Lights, occur when energetic charged particles travelling along the Earthâs magnetic field lines collide with gases in the upper atmosphere, emitting light. 
Astonishingly, there are some reports of the lights even being visible in Victoria and New South Wales.

Aurora Borealis is the term used to describe the phenomenon in the northern hemisphere, while Aurora Australis is used in the south. 
These lights are most visible in Australia and New Zealandâs southern areas during this time of year, although they can occur at any time. 
According to the Australian Space Weather Forecasting Centre, auroras are most likely to appear in March and September due to the Earthâs orientation relative to the sun and the likelihood of solar storms. 
The atmosphereâs composition determines the shades of an aurora, with more oxygen-producing greens and yellows and more nitrogen resulting in dark red or blue.

It is thought that machinery in the facility may have ignited methane gas, leading to the deadliest barn fire for cattle in the history of Texas. The cause of the explosion and fire is not yet known, but the investigation and clean-up process could take some time, according to Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller. One agricultural worker was also injured in the incident.","About 18,000 cows have been killed in a âhorrificâ explosion and fire at a dairy farm in the southern US state of Texas.
One agricultural worker was also injured, authorities said on Thursday.
Itâs thought that machinery in the facility may have ignited methane gas.
âThis was the deadliest barn fire for cattle in Texas history and the investigation and clean-up may take some time,â Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in a statement.
The explosion and fire ripped through the Southfork Dairy Farms near the town of Dimmitt in the Texas Panhandle on Monday night.
A photo showed an enormous plume of smoke rising into the sky following the incident. 
Many of the cattle died because a fire spread to an area where the cows were being held before being taken to a milking area and then into a holding pen, the BBC reports. 
âThereâs some that survived,â Sheriff Sal Rivera told local news outlet KFDA.
âThereâs some that are probably injured to the point where theyâll have to be destroyed.â
Firefighters and police rushed to the scene and âdetermined that one person was trapped inside,â the Castro County Sheriffâs Office said on Facebook. The person was rescued and flown to a hospital in Lubbock, it said.
The cause of the explosion and fire were not immediately clear, said Miller, who described it as a âhorrific event.â
âOnce we know the cause and the facts surrounding this tragedy, we will make sure the public is fully informed â so tragedies like this can be avoided in the future,â he said.
Castro County Sheriff Sal Rivera told the CBS affiliate in Amarillo that a system to remove manure from the barns may have gotten âoverheated.â He said methane may have âignited and then spread out with the explosion and the fire,â adding that a probe would have to determine the precise cause.
âFarms must do more to protect animals by adopting commonsense fire safety measures,â tweeted the Animal Welfare Institute, one of the oldest animal welfare charities in the United States, referring to the Texas tragedy.

0,"Indigenous Australians in central Queensland criticize the state government for planning to meet the former leader of a far-right group. Torin O'Brien was banned from Facebook after leading a group to surround an Indigenous teen's home. O'Brien has been accused of posting offensive anti-Islam content and using racist slurs against Indigenous people. The government is accused of legitimizing a ""mob,"" while locals worry about being misidentified or facing violence. MPs defend the decision to meet with O'Brien, while police are investigating whether charges should be laid.","First Nations people in central Queensland say the state government is inflaming local tensions by pushing ahead with plans to meet with the former leader of a far-right âpatriotsâ group, who was booted off Facebook after leading a mob to surround the Rockhampton home of an Indigenous teenager. Guardian Australia on Tuesday revealed that the ringleader of the group, Torin OâBrien, is the former president of a group that regularly posted offensive anti-Islam content online. OâBrien referred to himself online as part of the âInfidel Legionâ and made comments calling Muslim people âknuckle draggersâ. Last week, he posted the names and photographs of two Aboriginal young people, believed to be teenagers, on Facebook and accused them of criminal activity. OâBrien then corralled locals to attend their home on Sunday. On Tuesday, Facebook deleted OâBrienâs profile for breaching the platformâs community standards, while Labor MPs defended the decision to meet with him. The former One Nation candidate, who was portrayed as an âanti-crime crusaderâ in some media reports, was invited to sit down âwith police and other stakeholdersâ, as community tensions related to youth crime escalate. Alwyn Doolan, a Gooreng Gooreng and Wakka Wakka man from the Aboriginal community of Woorabinda, west of Rockhampton, said the government had legitimised a âmobâ. âThe community is very wary,â Doolan said. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoonemail newsletters for your daily news roundup âThis fella shouldnât have any dealings with government and I donât understand why Annastacia Palaszcuk is not out clearly condemning this as well.â Doolan said Aboriginal people in the community were âlooking over their shoulderâ and worried about the potential of being misidentified or subject to violence. OâBrien has been contacted for comment. The Facebook group he created â to organise community members to go to the homes of people he accused of being criminals â remains online. Posts in the group use racist slurs to refer to Indigenous people. One post, about a ârace warâ, said: âbring it on that would mean we could legally go and get these dogsâ. Guardian Australia has also seen posts by far-right groups that appear designed to fan racial tensions in Queensland and promote vigilante actions. The MP for Rockhampton, Barry OâRourke, confirmed he invited OâBrien to attend a meeting âwith police and other stakeholdersâ. âThere is no place for mob action. I completely agree with the police commissioner that this kind of behaviour is extremely dangerous and unhelpful. Weâve seen this kind of behaviour lead to innocent people being harmed or killed in the past and thatâs what we desperately want to avoid in Rockhampton,â OâRourke said. âThe contempt we saw for police on the weekend was especially worrying. âThat is why I have invited Mr OâBrien to attend a meeting with police and other stakeholders â itâs an opportunity for him to air his views the right way, and also an opportunity for police to emphasise the risks to himself and others from these actions. No one wants to see this escalate.â The Queensland police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, told reporters on Monday that information posted online was not correct and urged Queenslanders not to take the law into their own hands. Asked on Tuesday why police were meeting with OâBrien, Carroll said itâs âincredibly important to meet with everyoneâ. She said police were still investigating whether charges should be laid. âItâs incredibly important that, irrespective of what your background is, to give those people perspective, and to actually tell them what theyâre doing is not quite correct,â she said. The police minister, Mark Ryan, said it was âgood representationâ for local MPs to meet with members of their community. Asked whether this included those who espouse anti-Islam beliefs, Ryan said âjust because you meet with someone doesnât mean you agree with themâ. âYou can be appalled by someoneâs views but nonetheless your role is to listen to people,â he said.

TSB's research found that 80% of its three largest fraud categories (impersonation, purchase, and investment) came from Meta-owned sites and apps. Impersonation scams on Meta's platforms accounted for 86% of cases in that category recorded by TSB, with two-thirds of those incidents on WhatsApp. TSB also warned of a 300% rise in ""family and friends"" fraud on WhatsApp. Meanwhile, 80% of purchase fraud cases started on Facebook Marketplace, with TSB refunding 2,100 cases from that platform.","Meta has been urged to take action to protect customers from fraud, after TSB said scams via the social media companyâs platforms Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram have soared. The UK bank said there had been a huge jump in the number of scams originating from Meta-owned sites and apps, releasing research that shows they now account for 80% of cases within TSBâs three largest fraud categories: impersonation, purchase and investment. Its findings follow the announcement on Tuesday of a government crackdown on scammers in response to the massive growth of web-based fraud, including a ban on technology that allows mass texting of numerous phones. Paul Davis, the director of fraud prevention at TSB, said: âSocial media companies must urgently clean up their platforms to protect the countless innocent people who use their services every day. âIn the meantime, we are urging the public to remain cautious to potential scam content â and to spread the word to help protect those around you. âItâs high time that social media and telephone companies took financial liability for the rising levels of fraud taking place on their platforms.â Impersonation scams originating on Metaâs platforms accounted for 86% of cases in that category recorded by TSB between 2021 and 2022, with two-thirds of those incidents coming from WhatsApp. âFamily and friendsâ fraud cases via the mobile messaging platform rocketed by 300% in a year, according to TSB analysis of its fraud data, and the bank refunded more than 550 victims. The scam involves a con artist posing as a friend or relative of the victim. They get in touch via WhatsApp or another messaging platform and gain the targetâs trust before asking for money. TSB warned consumers to be vigilant to any unexpected messages purporting to be from family or friends, and advised contacting the individual directly before sending a payment. Meanwhile, the bank found that 80% of purchase fraud cases â where someone is tricked into buying a product or service that does not exist â began via Metaâs platforms. Most of these originated through Facebook Marketplace, where incidents of fraud almost doubled in one year. TSB refunded 2,100 cases from this platform under the bankâs fraud refund guarantee. The research also found that scams taking place through Meta account for almost 87% of all investment fraud cases at TSB, and they predominantly begin on Instagram and Facebook. TSB fraud experts urged consumers to stick to recognised investment platforms and to avoid social media âget rich quickâ schemes. A Meta spokesperson said: âThis is an industry-wide issue and scammers are using increasingly sophisticated methods to defraud people in a range of ways including email, SMS and offline. âWe donât want anyone to fall victim to these criminals which is why our platforms have systems to block scams, financial services advertisers now have to be FCA authorised and we run consumer awareness campaigns on how to spot fraudulent behaviour. âPeople can also report this content in a few simple clicks and we work with the police to support their investigations.â",Guardian,4/05/2023,Facebook and WhatsApp owner urged by UK bank to act on fraud as scams soar,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/05/facebook-whatsapp-instagram-fraud-scams-tsb-meta

The FTC is proposing to tighten the existing agreement on privacy to include a ban on profiting from minors' data and expanded limitations on using facial recognition technology. Meta's parent company, Facebook, is also facing criticism over revelations that it steered young users towards damaging content that could have severe mental health impacts. The FTC's move has been applauded by consumer rights groups as a positive step towards creating more robust protections for children online. Meta has 30 days to respond to the proposed changes.","The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is accusing Facebook of misleading parents about protections for children and is proposing to tighten an existing agreement on privacy to include a ban on profiting from minorsâ data. The FTC said on Wednesday that Facebook misled parents about how much control they had over who their children had contact with in the Messenger Kids app and was deceptive about how much access app developers had to usersâ private data, breaching a 2019 agreement on privacy. The FTCâs proposed changes include barring Facebook from making money off data collected on users under age 18, including in its virtual reality business. It would also face expanded limitations on using facial recognition technology. Shares of Meta, Facebookâs parent company, fell as much as 2% after the news. A Meta spokesperson, Andy Stone, said on Twitter that the move was a âpolitical stuntâ. âWe will vigorously fight this action and expect to prevail,â he wrote. The FTCâs action on Wednesday is the first step in the process of changing the 2019 agreement. Facebook will have 30 days to answer. The company can appeal any commission decision to an appeals court. âFacebook has repeatedly violated its privacy promises,â said Samuel Levine, director of the FTCâs Bureau of Consumer Protection. âThe companyâs recklessness has put young users at risk, and Facebook needs to answer for its failures.â The FTC has twice before settled with Facebook over privacy violations. The first time was in 2012. Facebook agreed in 2019 to pay a record $5bn fine to resolve allegations it had violated a 2012 consent order by misleading users about how much control they had over their personal data. That order was finalized in 2020. Meta is one of several social media giants to face scrutiny in recent years over potential harms its products pose to children. Meta leaders testified in front of Congress after revelations from whistleblower Frances Haugen that the company knew it steered young users towards damaging content that could have severe mental health impacts. Other social media firms have also faced increasing pressure surrounding the inability to control misinformation and hate speech on their platforms, an issue that was the subject of multiple congressional hearings in recent years. Still, little concrete action has been taken by Washington to address the concerns. As national legislation stalls, consumer rights groups applauded the FTCâs move, describing it as a positive step towards creating more robust protections for children online. âKids should never have been used as an engine of profit for Meta, and itâs great that the FTC is continuing to act aggressively,â said Lisa Gilbert, executive vice-president of the progressive non-profit Public Citizen. âUntil Congress acts on its promise to ensure privacy for kids and adults online, itâs critical that the agency boldly enforces the law.â",Guardian,3/05/2023,US regulators may ban Facebook from monetizing data from children,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/03/ftc-facebook-meta-messenger-kids-data-privacy

It has previously announced plans to slash hundreds more jobs amid a Â£30m cost-cutting drive as it battles higher costs resulting from inflation and disappointing advertising sales. The newspaper group, which owns a network of regionally focused news websites including Glasgow Live and Hampshire Live, said it had experienced a slowdown in the number of page views from online readers, with changes to the presentation of news by Facebook reducing traffic to its sites. Reachâs digital revenues have slumped by almost 15% since January and it warned of a challenging environment for digital advertising. However, it said its print revenue remained strong, and it had continued to sell ârobustâ quantities of newspapers. The company said revenue from print circulation rose by 2% over the period, as it benefited from higher prices it is charging for its newspapers that were introduced last year. Print advertising was slightly ahead of expectations. Jim Mullen, Reachâs chief executive, said: âExternal factors continue to impact digital revenue, delivery of the customer value strategy is driving a higher quality mix, underpinned by the strength of print. âOur focus on data, means customers are receiving and responding more often to relevant content and a more engaging user experience.â Reach, which is holding its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, said it was continuing with its plans to cut its operating costs by 5-6% this year, adding that its actions to do so were âwell advancedâ.

6,,"Maya Jones* was only 13 when she first walked through the door of Courtneyâs House, a drop-in centre for victims of child sex trafficking in Washington DC. âShe was so young, but she was already so broken by what sheâd been through,â says Tina Frundt, the founder of Courtneyâs House. Frundt, one of Washington DCâs most prominent specialists in countering child trafficking, has worked with hundreds of young people who have suffered terrible exploitation at the hands of adults, but when Maya eventually opened up about what she had been through, Frundt was shaken. Maya told Frundt that when she was 12, she had started receiving direct messages on Instagram from a man she didnât know. She said the man, who was 28, told her she was really pretty. According to Frundt, Maya told her that after she started chatting with the man, he asked her to send him naked photos. She told Frundt that he said he would pay her $40 for each one. He seemed kind and he kept giving Maya compliments, which made her feel special. She decided to meet him in person. Then came his next request: âCan you help me make some money?â According to Frundt, Maya explained that the man asked her to pose naked for photos, and to give him her Instagram password so that he could upload the photos to her profile. Frundt says Maya told her that the man, who was now calling himself a pimp, was using her Instagram profile to advertise her for sex. Before long, sex buyers started sending direct messages to her account, wanting to make a date. Maya told Frundt that she had watched, frozen, what was taking place on her account, as the pimp negotiated prices and logistics for meetings in motels around DC. She didnât know how to say no to this adult who had been so nice to her. Maya told Frundt that she hated having sex with these strangers but wanted to keep the pimp happy. One morning three months after she first met the man, Frundt says that Maya was found by a passerby lying crumpled on a street in south-east DC, half-naked and confused. The night before, Maya told her, a sex buyer had taken her somewhere against her will, and she later recalled being gang-raped there for hours before being dumped on the street. âShe was traumatised, and blamed herself for what happened. I had to work with her a lot to help her realise this was not her fault,â said Frundt when we visited Courtneyâs House last summer. Frundt, who has helped hundreds of children like Maya since she opened Courtneyâs House in 2008, says that the first thing she now does when a young person is referred to her is to ask for their Instagram handle. Other social media platforms are also used to exploit the young people in her care, but she says Instagram is the one that comes up most often. In the 20 years since the birth of social media, child sexual exploitation has become one of the biggest challenges facing tech companies. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the internet is used by human traffickers as âdigital hunting fieldsâ, allowing them access to both customers and potential victims, with children being targeted by traffickers on social media platforms. The biggest of these, Facebook, is owned by Meta, the tech giant whose platforms, which also include Instagram, are used by more than 3 billion people worldwide. In 2020, according to a report by US-based not-for-profit the Human Trafficking Institute, Facebook was the platform most used to groom and recruit children by sex traffickers (65%), based on an analysis of 105 federal child sex trafficking cases that year. The HTI analysis ranked Instagram second most prevalent, with Snapchat third. Grooming and child sex trafficking, though often researched and discussed together, are distinct acts. âGroomingâ refers to the period of manipulation of a victim prior to their exploitation for sex or for other purposes. âChild sex traffickingâ is the sexual exploitation of a child specifically as part of a commercial transaction. When the pimp was flattering and chatting with Maya, he was grooming her; when he was selling her to other adults for sex, he was trafficking. Though people often think of âtraffickingâ as the movement of victims across or within borders, under international law the term refers to the use of force, fraud or coercion to obtain labour, or in the buying and selling of non-consensual sex acts, whether or not travel is involved. Because, under international law, children cannot legally consent to any kind of sex act, anyone who profits from or pays for a sex act from a child â including profiting from or paying for photographs depicting sexual exploitation â is considered a human trafficker. Meta has numerous policies in place to try to prevent sex trafficking on its platforms. âItâs very important to me that everything we build is safe and good for kids,â Mark Zuckerberg, Metaâs founder, wrote in a memo to staff in 2021. In a statement responding to a detailed list of the allegations in this piece, a Meta spokesperson said: âThe exploitation of children is a horrific crime â we donât allow it and we work aggressively to fight it on and off our platforms. We proactively aid law enforcement in arresting and prosecuting the criminals who perpetrate these grotesque offences. When we are made aware that a victim is in harmâs way, and we have data that could help save a life, we process an emergency request immediately.â The statement cited the group director of intelligence at the charity Stop the Traffik, who is former deputy director of the UKâs Serious Organised Crime Agency, who has said âmillions are safer and traffickers are increasingly frustratedâ because of their work with Meta. But over the past two years, through interviews, survivor testimonies, US court documents and human trafficking reporting data, we have heard repeated claims that Facebook and Instagram have become major sales platforms for child trafficking. We have interviewed more than 70 sources, including survivors and their relatives, prosecutors, child protection professionals and content moderators across the US in order to understand how sex traffickers are using Facebook and Instagram, and why Meta is able to deny legal responsibility for the trafficking that takes place on its platforms. While Meta says it is doing all it can, we have seen evidence that suggests it is failing to report or even detect the full extent of what is happening, and many of those we interviewed said they felt powerless to get the company to act. The survivors * * * Courtneyâs House sits on a quiet residential street on the outskirts of Washington DC. Inside, Frundt and her team have tried to make the modest two-storey house feel like a family home, with comfortable sofas and photos on the mantlepiece. Frundt, who was herself trafficked as a child in the 1980s and 90s, is now one of Washington DCâs most experienced and respected anti-trafficking advocates. Warm and ferociously protective of the children in her care, she is contracted by the cityâs child protection services to identify trafficked children going through the court system, and she regularly attends court hearings for the youth in her care. She also helps train the FBI and local law enforcement sex-trafficking units on how to spot traffickers on online platforms, including Instagram. âWhen I was trafficked long ago I was advertised in the classified sections of freesheet newspapers,â Frundt told us. âNow my youth here are trafficked on Instagram. Itâs exactly the same business model but you just donât have to pay to place an ad.â The children who are referred to Frundt, usually by the police or social services, have been sexually exploited and controlled: by a boyfriend, a pimp, a family member. Some of them are as young as nine. Almost without exception, they have childhoods scarred by sexual abuse, poverty and violence. This makes them perfect targets for sexual predators. âThey are all looking for love and affirmation and a sense that they mean something,â said Frundt. Almost all the young people who come to Courtneyâs House are children of colour. They are, Frundt said, battling stereotypes that pressure them to become sexualised too early and make them vulnerable to traffickers. A 2017 study by the Georgetown Law Center on Poverty and Inequality found that adults typically regard Black girls as less innocent and more knowledgable about sex than their white peers. The same study showed that Black girls are often perceived to be older than they are. Most of the time, Frundt says, the children who come to Courtneyâs House are still being trafficked when they walk through the door. Even in cases where they have escaped their exploiters, she said, explicit videos and photos of them often continue to circulate online. Traffickers will lock victims out of their accounts, preventing them from taking down images posted to their profiles. When we asked Frundt if she could show us examples of young people in her care who she says are currently being trafficked on Instagram, she pulled out her phone and scrolled through post after post of explicit images and videos of girls as young as 14 or 15. Most of the photos and videos seemed to have been taken by someone else. Frundt said that these posts were being used as a way of advertising the girls for potential sex buyers, who would send a direct message to buy explicit content or to arrange a meet up. At one point, our conversation was interrupted by the arrival of five teenage girls. They had come back from school, and they gathered around the kitchen table, chatting and playing music on their phones while Frundt served them casserole. After they had eaten, we asked if we could talk to them about their experiences: had any of them been sexually exploited on social media or had explicit videos or pictures posted of them? They glanced at each other and burst out laughing. Yes, they said, of course. All the time. One girl said she felt that ânobody at Instagram cares, they donât care whatâs posted. They donât care shit about us.â Frundt claims that she is constantly asking Instagram to close accounts and take down exploitative content of kids in her care. âI even have law enforcement calling me up asking, âTina, can you get Instagram to do something?â. If I canât get Instagram to act, what hope is there for anyone else?â When we put these concerns to Meta, a spokesperson said: âWe take all allegations and reports of content involving children extremely seriously and have diligently responded to requests from Courtneyâs House. Our ability to remove content or delete accounts requires sufficient information to determine that the content or user violates our policies.â Frundt says that in 2020 and 2021 she had discussions with Instagram about conducting staff training to help prevent child trafficking on its platforms. She says the training didnât go ahead as, after a long back and forth, on a video call Instagram executives said that they wouldnât pay Frundt her standard fee of $3,000, instead allegedly offering $300. When we put this to Meta, they did not deny it. The court documents and the prosecutors * * * What makes social media platforms so powerful as a tool for traffickers â far more powerful than the back pages of a newspaper in which Frundt was advertised as a teenager â is the way that they make it possible to identify and cultivate relationships with both victims and potential sex buyers. Traffickers can advertise and negotiate deals by using different features of the same platform: sellers sometimes post publicly about the girls they have available, and then switch to private direct messages to discuss prices and locations with buyers. US court documents provide a graphic insight into how these platforms can be used. In one case prosecuted in Arizona in 2019, Mauro Veliz, a 31-year-old who was convicted of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of a child, exchanged messages on Facebook Messenger with Miesha Tolliver, who also received jail time for sex trafficking. Tolliver told Veliz that she had one girl available for sex, and photographs of two more, before saying that the girls were aged 17, 16 and 14. Veliz: âHow much is it for all of them?â Tolliver: âThe 14 [year-old] will cost the most â¦ a couple of hundred for her but [$] 150 for the restâ The 14-year-old, Tolliver told Veliz, was ânew to the sex gameâ. Tolliver: âThe 1 on the right â¦ is 16 with a fat ass ... the other [is] 15 with huge titsâ The court transcripts then state that multiple sexually explicit images of the girls were sent to Veliz. Tolliver: âdo you want me to bring 1 of the girls with me so you guys can fuck?â [ ... ] Veliz: âis your girl nervous? Or have you told her yet?â Tolliver: ââ¦ shes still young and doesnât understand how ppl like itâ Tolliver and Veliz exchanged more messages, arranging for Veliz to meet the girl in a hotel in California two days later. The final message submitted to the court was from Veliz to Tolliver. âWeâre finished sheâs in the restroom,â it said. Luke Goldworm, a former assistant district attorney in Boston, Massachusetts, who has investigated and prosecuted human trafficking cases for years, says that he has encountered numerous exchanges like this one. From 2019 until he left the job in October 2022, he said, his departmentâs caseload of child-trafficking crimes on social media platforms increased by about 30% each year. âWeâre seeing more and more people with significant criminal records move into this area. Itâs incredibly lucrative,â he said. A trafficker can make up to $1,000 a night. Many of the victims he saw were just 11 or 12, he said, and most of them were Black, Latinx or LGBTQI+. According to Goldworm, while his investigations involved every social media platform, Meta platforms were the ones he encountered most often. Six other prosecutors in several different states told us that, in their experience, Facebook and Instagram are being widely used to groom children and traffick children. Five of these prosecutors spoke of their anger over what they felt were Metaâs unnecessary delays in complying with judge-signed warrants and subpoenas needed to gather evidence on sex trafficking cases. âWe get a higher rate of rejected warrants from Facebook than any other electronic service provider,â claimed Gary Ernsdorff, senior deputy prosecuting attorney for King County, Washington state. âWhat I find frustrating is that the exchange can delay rescuing a victim by a month.â Three of these prosecutors described experiences where they say the company would cite technicalities, picking faults with wording and format, and slowing down investigations. In response, the company said that these claims were âfalseâ, adding that between January and June last year, it âprovided data in nearly 88% of requests from the US governmentâ. The responsibility for reporting * * * Meta acknowledges that human traffickers use its platforms, but insists that it is doing everything in its power to stop them. By law, the company is required to report any child sexual abuse imagery shared over its platforms to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC), which receives federal funding to act as a nationwide clearing house for leads about child abuse. Meta is a major funder of NCMEC, and holds a seat on the companyâs board. From January to September 2022, Facebook reported more than 73.3m pieces of content under âchild nudity and physical abuseâ and âchild sexual exploitationâ and Instagram reported 6.1m. âMeta leads the industry in using the most sophisticated technology to detect both known and previously unknown child exploitation content,â said a company spokesperson. Of the 34m pieces of child sexual exploitation content removed from Facebook and Instagram in the final three months of 2022, 98% was detected by Meta itself. But the vast majority of the content that Meta reports falls under child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) â which includes photos and videos of pornographic content â rather than sex trafficking. Unlike with child sexual abuse imagery, there is no legal requirement to report child sex trafficking, so NCMEC must rely on all social media companies to be proactive in searching for and reporting it. This legal inconsistency â the fact that child sexual abuse imagery must be reported, but reporting child sex trafficking is not legally required â is a major problem, says Staca Shehan, vice-president of the analytical services division at NCMEC. âItâs concerning across the board how little trafficking is being reported,â Shehan says. Social media companies âare prioritising whatâs [legally] requiredâ. âI think everyone could do more,â Shehan says. âThe volume of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and volume of trafficking [being reported] is like apples and oranges.â According to Shehan, one further reason for this disparity, beyond the differing legal requirements, is technological. âChild sexual abuse material is that much easier to detect. There are so many technology tools that have been developed that allow for the automated detection of that crime.â A NCMEC spokesperson told us that if social media companies are not reporting child sex trafficking, it allows this crime to thrive online. Reporting trafficking, they emphasised, is crucial for rescuing victims and punishing offenders. Between 2009 and 2019, Meta reported just three cases as suspected child sex trafficking in the US to NCMEC, according to records disclosed in a subpoena request seen by the Guardian. A spokesperson for NCMEC confirmed this figure, but clarified that a number of child trafficking cases during the same time period were reported by Meta under other âincident typesâ, such as child pornography or enticement. âI think one of the things to be aware of is that is that thereâs sort of a singular tag thatâs used for reporting,â Antigone Davis, head of global safety at Meta, emphasised to us in a recent interview. âAnd so just because something isnât tagged as sex trafficking doesnât mean that it isnât being reported.â A Meta spokesperson claimed that over the past decade, the company had reported âtens of thousands of accounts which violated our policies against child sex trafficking and commercial child sexual abuse material to NCMEC.â When we put these claims to NCMEC, it said that it had not received âtens of thousandsâ of reports of child trafficking from Meta, but had received that number related to child abuse imagery. Hany Farid is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley who helped invent the PhotoDNA technology that Meta uses to identify harmful content. He believes Meta, which is currently valued at more than $500bn, could do more to combat child trafficking. It could, for instance, be investing more to develop better tools to âflag suspicious words and phrases on unencrypted parts of the platform â including coded language around grooming,â he said. âThis is, fundamentally, not a technological problem, but one of corporate priorities.â (There is a separate debate about how to handle encryption. Metaâs plans to encrypt direct messages on Facebook Messenger and Instagram has recently drawn criticism from law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and Interpol.) In response to Faridâs claims and further questions from the Guardian, Meta did not specify how much money it has invested in technologies to detect child sex trafficking, but said that it had âfocused on using AI and machine learning on non-private, unencrypted parts of its platforms to identify harmful content and accounts and make it easier for people to report messages to the company so we can take action, including referrals to law enforcementâ. Davis also emphasised that Meta constantly works with partners to improve its anti-trafficking safeguards. For instance, she mentioned that âweâve been able to identify the kinds of searches that people do when theyâre searching for trafficking content, so that when people search for that, we will pop up with information to divert them or to let them know that what theyâre doing is illegal activityâ. These efforts have failed to satisfy some of Metaâs own investors. In March, several pension and investment funds that own Meta stock launched legal action against the company in Delaware over its alleged failure to act on âsystemic evidenceâ that its platforms are facilitating sex trafficking and child sexual exploitation. By offering insufficient explanation of how it is tackling these crimes, the complaint says, the board has failed to protect the interests of the company. Meta has rejected the basis for the lawsuit. âOur goal is to prevent people who seek to exploit others from using our platform,â the company said. The moderators * * * As well as software, Meta uses teams of human moderators to identify cases of child grooming and sex trafficking. Until recently, Anna Walker* worked the night shift in an office of a Meta subcontractor. She would start each shift filled with dread. âWe were just, like, shoved in a dark room to look at the stuff,â she said. Walkerâs job was to review interactions between adults and children on Facebook Messenger and Instagram direct messenger that had been flagged as suspicious by Metaâs AI software. Walker claims she and her team struggled to keep pace with the huge backlog of cases. She says she saw cases of adults grooming children and then making plans to meet them for sex, as well as discussions about payment in exchange for sex. Walkerâs managers would pass on such cases to Meta to decide if action should be taken against the user. In some cases, Walker claims: âMonths would pass and then the automatic bot would send me an email saying it was closing this case, because nobodyâs taken action on it.â She added: âI would cry to my manager about [the children I saw] and how I want to help. But it felt like nobody would pay attention to these horrible things.â We talked to six other moderators who worked for companies that Meta subcontracted between 2016 and 2022. All made similar claims to Walker. Their efforts to flag and escalate possible child trafficking on Meta platforms often went nowhere, they said. âOn one post I reviewed, there was a picture of this girl that looked about 12, wearing the smallest lingerie you could imagine,â said one former moderator. âIt listed prices for different things explicitly, like, a blowjob is this much. It was obvious that it was trafficking,â she told us. She claims that her supervisor later told her no further action had been taken in this case. When we put these claims to Meta, a spokesperson said that moderators such as Walker do not typically get feedback on whether their flagged content has been escalated. They stressed that if a moderator does not hear back about a flagged case, that does not mean no action has been taken. Five of the moderators claimed that it was harder to get cases escalated or content taken down if it was posted on closed Facebook groups or Facebook Messenger. Meta âwould be less stringent about something taking place behind âclosed doorsâ,â claimed one team leader. âWith Messenger, we really couldnât make any moves unless the language and content was really obvious. If it was four guys who trusted each other and it was in a group it could just live on for ever.â Meta said these allegations âappear to be misleading and inaccurateâ and said it uses technology to find child sexualisation content in private Facebook groups and on Messenger. In 2021, former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked internal documents that seem to support the moderatorsâ claims. These documents, which numbered thousands of pages, detailed how the company managed harmful content. In one memo from the Haugen leak, the company states that âMessenger groups with less than 32 people should be treated with a full expectation of privacyâ. Matias Cruz*, who worked as a content moderator from 2018 to 2020, reviewing Spanish-language posts on Facebook, believes that the criteria that Meta was using to recognise trafficking was too narrow to keep up with traffickers, who would constantly switch codewords to avoid detection. According to Cruz, traffickers would say: ââI have this cabra [Spanish for goat] for sale,â and itâd be some really ridiculous price. Sometimes they would just outright say [the price] for a night or two, or âan hourâ.â It was obvious what was going on, said Cruz, but âthe managers would claim it was too vague, so in the end they would just leave it upâ. Cruz and three other moderators we spoke to claimed that in examples like this, where their managers felt there was insufficient evidence to escalate the case, moderators could receive lower accuracy scores, which in turn would affect their performance assessments. âWe would take negative hits on their accuracy scores to try to get some help to these people,â Cruz said. The limits of the law * * * While the law requires Meta to report any child exploitation imagery detected on its platforms, the company is not legally responsible for crimes that occur on its platform, because of a law created almost three decades ago, in the early days of the internet. In 1996, the US Congress passed the Communications Decency Act, which was primarily intended to ensure online pornographic content was regulated. But section 230 of the act states that providers of âinteractive computer servicesâ â which includes the owners of social media platforms and website hosts â should not be treated as the publisher of material posted by users. This section was included in the act to ensure the free flow of information while protecting the growing tech industry from being crushed by litigation. Whereas a newspaper, say, must legally defend what it publishes, section 230 means that a company like Meta, which hosts the content of others, may not be held liable for what appears on its platforms. Section 230 therefore positions internet service providers as fundamentally neutral: offering forums in which illegal, harmful or false content may be posted and circulated, but ultimately not responsible for that content. Since the passing of the act, tech companies such as Meta have argued successfully in courts across the US that section 230 provides them with complete immunity from prosecution for any illegal content published on their platforms, as long as they are unaware of that contentâs existence. The debate around section 230 has become highly polarised. Those who want section 230 amended say that the legal safe harbour it has provided for internet companies means they have no incentive to root out illegal content on their sites. In an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal in January, President Biden spoke out in favour of the sectionâs reform. âIâve long said we must fundamentally reform section 230,â he wrote, calling for âbipartisan action by Congress to hold big tech accountable.â However, tech companies, along with internet freedom groups, argue that changes to section 230 could lead to censorship and an erosion of privacy, particularly for private, encrypted content. These arguments over section 230 are being put to the test in a landmark case that has reached the US supreme court, which focuses on how far YouTube can be considered culpable for the videos it recommends to its users. A ruling is due by the end of June. The consequences * * * Kyle Robinson is one year into serving a 10-year sentence at a federal prison in Massachusetts for sex trafficking two teenagers, one only 14 years old. We spoke to him in January over the muffled line of the prisonâs payphone, our conversation interrupted by prison staff monitoring the call. Referring to himself as a pimp, Robinson described how he sought out damaged girls from care homes and on social media as a way to make money. Instagram, he said, was his platform of choice. âI find the girls that have pride in themselves, but maybe donât have the confidence, the self-esteem,â he claimed. âI make her feel special. I give her validation, social skills, her âhotentialâ, if you know what I mean.â Once he had identified his targets, Robinson claimed that he would âcoachâ them and advertise them on their Instagram accounts and his own. He would talk to potential buyers through direct messages, offering to send video snippets of the girls in return for âa small depositâ â about $20 â so that the buyers could see what they would be getting. If a buyer decided to meet a girl, he would pay her the rest of the money later, via CashApp, he said. Robinson would then take most of that money. To crack down on such cases of child sexual exploitation, last June Meta announced new policies including age verification software that will require users under 18 to provide proof of age through uploading an ID, recording a video selfie, or asking mutual friends on Facebook to confirm their age. When we asked Tina Frundt about these new measures, she was sceptical. The kids she works with had already found workarounds; a 14-year-old, for example, might use a video selfie made by her 18-year-old friend, and pretend that itâs her own. Even after children have been referred to Courtneyâs House, they continue to be vulnerable to traffickers. One night in June 2021, Frundt says she got a call from Maya, telling her she had arrived home safe. Frundt was relieved: she knew that Maya had spent the evening with a 43-year-old man who had been contacting her on Instagram. Frundt says that Maya, now 15, was in a fragile state: over the previous few months, her mental health had been in sharp decline and she had told Frundt sheâd been feeling suicidal. Photos and explicit videos taken by a pimp showing her having sex were being circulated and sold on Instagram. Sex buyers were contacting her relentlessly through her direct messages. âShe didnât know how to make it stop or how to say no,â Frundt recalled. That night, on the phone, Frundt told Maya that she loved her and that they would talk in the morning. âThatâs the last time I ever spoke to her,â said Frundt. The older man had given Maya drugs. When Mayaâs mother went to wake her daughter the next morning, she found her dead. A picture of Maya that still hangs on the wall of Courtneyâs House shows a baby-faced teenage girl with brown curls and a huge smile. Two years after her death, Frundt continues to grieve for her caring âgirly girlâ who loved makeup, board games and dancing to her favourite Megan Thee Stallion songs. âLosing one of our youth, it changes you for ever. You can never forgive yourself,â she said. Before Maya died, Frundt claims she spoke to Instagram on a video call, asking them to remove the exploitative content her trafficker had circulated. Frundt says that when Maya died, the videos of her being exploited were still on the platform. In July 2021, a representative from an anti-trafficking organisation sent an email to Instagramâs head of youth policy, informing her of Mayaâs death. Frundt was copied in on the email. It asked why Metaâs tools designed to detect grooming had not flagged a 43-year-old man contacting a young girl. Four days later, the company sent a brief reply. If Instagram was provided with details about the alleged traffickerâs account, it would investigate. But Frundt says that it was too late. âShe had already passed,â she says. âThey could have done something to help her but they didnât. She was gone.â Names marked with an asterisk have been changed to preserve anonymity. â¢ In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453.

7,"Facebook groups offering fake reviews in exchange for free products on online retail platforms such as Amazon, Google, and Trustpilot continue to exist, despite previous interventions by UK regulators, according to consumer group Which?. The social network has reportedly removed over 16,000 groups since 2020, but Which? researchers found 14 groups sharing over 62,000 members. The UK government's forthcoming digital markets, competition and consumer bill could make the practice illegal by imposing penalties on hosting fake reviews and paying someone to write a fake review. Amazon, Google, and Trustpilot said they monitor Facebook groups and report incentivised reviews.","Facebook groups offering fake reviews on the likes of Amazon, Google and Trustpilot are still persistent despite regulatorsâ demands that tech platforms do more to tackle the issue, according to an investigation by a consumer group. Groups on the social network with thousands of members offer free products in exchange for reviews, said the consumer group Which?, despite past interventions by UK regulators. Researchers found 14 Facebook groups trading in reviews for Amazon, Google and Trustpilot. Together they shared more than 62,000 members between them. Fake reviews have become one of the most persistent scourges of online retailers, and the UK government is expected to make the practice illegal in the forthcoming digital markets, competition and consumer bill. The bill would make it illegal to pay someone to write a fake review or to host a review without taking steps to check it is real. The UKâs Competition and Markets Authority told Facebook to clamp down on fake reviews in 2020 and again in 2021, when the social network removed more than 16,000 groups. Which? estimates that the groups it has reported to Facebook since 2018 have had more than 1 million members in total. Rocio Concha, the consumer groupâs director of policy and advocacy, said: âAn industry dedicated to fake review trading continues to thrive on Facebook, leaving consumers exposed to misleading information on some of the worldâs biggest review and shopping platforms.â She said the âstrong enforcement and tough penalties for platforms that fail in their legal responsibilitiesâ promised by the UK government was âsorely needed to tackle fake reviewsâ. A spokesperson for Meta, Facebookâs parent company, said: âFraudulent and deceptive activity is not allowed on our platforms, including offering or trading fake reviews. Weâve removed the groups shared with us for violating our policies. While no enforcement is perfect, we continue to invest in new technologies and methods to protect our users from this kind of content.â Six of the newly identified groups offered free products in exchange for Amazon reviews. One group identified by Which?, âAmazon Reviewer - Test Productsâ, counted 15,000 members. On a group sharing that name, the Guardian found posts appearing to ask for UK, US and French buyers of products including a garlic crusher, wireless headphones, and designer-imitation handbags. Comments on the groups and the research by Which? suggested that users would buy the products, and then receive a refund once they had given a five-star review. Spokespeople for Amazon and Trustpilot said they actively monitored Facebook groups and reported incentivised reviews, and that they employed teams of investigators. âBy taking this action against fraudsters, we are going after the source of the problem and shutting down these fake review businesses,â the Amazon spokesperson said. The Trustpilot spokesperson said: âWe closely monitor Facebook groups claiming to sell fake reviews on Trustpilot, and we take strong and robust action to combat the practice.â A Google spokesperson said: âOur policies clearly state reviews must be based on real experiences, and when we find policy violations, we take swift action ranging from content removal to account suspension and even litigation.â",Guardian,20/04/2023,"Trade in fake reviews still âthrivingâ on Facebook, says Which?",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/apr/21/trade-in-fake-reviews-still-thriving-on-facebook-says-which
8,"An alliance of law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and Interpol, has criticized Meta's plans to encrypt direct messages on Facebook Messenger and Instagram, stating that it will reduce their ability to keep child users safe. The Virtual Global Taskforce, made up of 15 agencies, praised Meta's work with the American National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children but fears that encryption could lead to an increase in child abuse as law enforcement may no longer be able to access evidence. Meta stated that it has developed safety measures that prevent, detect and allow it to take action against abuse while maintaining privacy and security.","An alliance of the worldâs most powerful law enforcement agencies including the FBI, Interpol and Britainâs National Crime Agency (NCA) have condemned Metaâs plans to encrypt direct messages on Facebook Messenger and Instagram, saying that doing so will weaken the ability to keep child users safe. The Virtual Global Taskforce, made up of 15 agencies, is chaired by the NCA and also includes Europol and the Australian federal police among its membership. The VGT has spoken out, it says, owing to the âimpending design choicesâ by Meta, which it says could cause serious harm. The decision to encrypt direct messages on the platforms, which would prevent anyone other than the intended recipient being able to intercept the communications, âis an example of a purposeful design choice that degrades safety systems and weakens the ability to keep child users safeâ, the alliance said. The VGT praised Metaâs work with the American National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which acts as a clearing house for reports on online child sexual abuse. Meta reported more such cases to the NCMEC than any other provider, the alliance said, but it feared that lead would disappear once the messages are âend-to-end encryptedâ (E2EE). âThe VGT has not yet seen any indication from Meta that any new safety systems implemented post-E2EE will effectively match or improve their current detection methods,â it said. Citing the case of David Wilson, who was jailed in 2021 for abusing 52 children, the VGT predicted similar arrests could prove impossible with encryption enabled. âThe successful prosecution of Wilson and the resulting safeguarding of hundreds of children was possible because law enforcement were able to access the evidence contained within over 250,000 messages through Facebook. In an E2EE environment, it is highly unlikely this case would have been detected.â In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said: âThe overwhelming majority of Brits already rely on apps that use encryption. We donât think people want us reading their private messages, so have developed safety measures that prevent, detect and allow us to take action against this heinous abuse, while maintaining online privacy and security. âAs we continue to roll out our end-to-end encryption plans, we remain committed to working with law enforcement and child safety experts to ensure that our platforms are safe for young people. âIn the case of David Wilson, we submitted Cybertips to authorities using both public and private information,â the spokesperson added. âWe have developed detection systems using behavioural signals and other account activity that are not reliant on the content of private messages to identify malicious actors like David Wilson. Itâs misleading and inaccurate to say that encryption would have prevented us from identifying and reporting accounts like David Wilsonâs to the authorities.â Plans to encrypt all messages on Metaâs platforms were first revealed in 2019, when the company was still called Facebook. But they have been delayed a number of times, because of technical hurdles and regulatory pressure. In April 2021, the company announced the integration would not happen until 2022 at the earliest, before pushing the deadline back to 2023 in November 2021. âWeâre taking our time to get this right,â Metaâs head of safety, Antigone Davis, said when the latest delay was announced. âAs a company that connects billions of people around the world and has built industry-leading technology, weâre determined to protect peopleâs private communications and keep people safe online.â But in the years since, Meta has given few details on how the push to encrypt communications by default would avoid harsh trade-offs against its existing child safety practices. Davis said Meta would be able to detect abuse by using non-encrypted data, account information and reports from users. Metaâs third messaging platform, WhatsApp, already uses a similar approach to tackle child sexual abuse but makes far fewer referrals to NCMEC as a result. In March 2022, the non-profit released data showing Facebook made 22m reports of online exploitation of children in 2021, while WhatsApp made just 1.3m. Other encrypted platforms with similar user bases were even worse: Apple, which runs iMessage, reported just 160 cases. VGTâs intervention comes two days after WhatsApp joined forces with other encrypted messaging apps, including its rival Signal, to call on the UK government to protect E2EE in the online safety bill. The services hinted they may be forced to leave the UK, rather than obey the new law, if it attempted to criminalise encryption.",Guardian,20/04/2023,Crime agencies condemn Facebook and Instagram encryption plans,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/20/crime-agencies-condemn-facebook-instagram-encryption-plans
9,"Essex police investigating an alleged hate crime over the display of racist dolls in a pub are to examine online messages by the pubs landlord, Christopher Ryley. Ryley is known for his far-right views and regularly posts content from anti-immigrant commentators such as Katie Hopkins on Facebook. In a Facebook post from 2016, Ryley uploaded a picture of golly dolls hanging from his bar with a comment referring to lynchings in Mississippi. Essex police confiscated the dolls after receiving a complaint about an alleged crime. The force has now confirmed that detectives conducting the investigation are aware of Ryleys Facebook posts.","Police investigating an alleged hate crime over the display of golly dolls in an Essex pub are to examine online messages by the pubâs landlord in which he apparently joked about Mississippi lynchings alongside an image of the racist dolls. Christopher Ryley, the licensee of the White Hart Inn in Grays, Essex, regularly posts on Facebook to express far-right views and share content from anti-immigrant commentators such as Katie Hopkins. In March 2016, in a Facebook post still online, Ryley uploaded a picture of golly dolls hanging from his bar with the comment âWe have our golliwogs, yaay.â Commenting on the post his wife, Benice Ryley, asked: âAre you sure this is legal. lol.â The landlord replied: âThey used to hang them in Mississippi years ago.â Essex police confiscated the golly dolls last week after receiving a complaint about an alleged crime. The force has now confirmed that detectives conducting the investigation are aware of Ryleyâs Facebook posts. It is understood the posts are being reviewed as part of the investigation. Ryley is due to be interviewed by Essex police next month when he returns from the familyâs holiday home in Marmaris, on the southern Turkish coast. It is believed the investigation is focusing on establishing whether he intended to cause offence by displaying the dolls. One other possible line of inquiry is whether his posts flout the 1988 Malicious Communication Act. Earlier this week, a source close to Suella Braverman suggested Essex police had been reprimanded by the home secretary. The police force denied this. In 2018 Ryley was asked by his local council to explain the dolls in the pubâs bar but denied they were racist. Posting about that on Facebook, he said: âToday Iâve had a call from our council licencing dept because some âSnowflakeâ has decided that they think they are racial. They have even gone to the police to complain that it could constitute âracial aggrevationâ I never invited this person in, if they are not happy, go elsewhere. Our customers bring these items in from their travels. We have a lot of âcoloured customersâ who have never complained.â In July last year he complained about the prospect of a Muslim prime minister, in an apparent mistaken reference to Rishi Sunak, who is a Hindu. He said: âWe now have the prospect of a Muslim PM, along with â¦ other Muslim mayorâs throughout the UK. Donât get me wrong, I choose to live in a Muslim country, here in Turkey. Did all the UK population agree to live under a Muslim regime? Muanmar Kadaffi said in 2008, we donât need guns or bombs. We will simply out breed Europeans.â In May 2021 Ryley complained about media coverage of the US police murder of George Floyd, writing: âWhy are MSM dragging up George Floyd a year after he died? What about our own ppl who have died, Lee Rigby, why does he not get mentioned. Sorry, I forgot, he was white. That donât count.â In 2017, Ryley likened the C2C train line connecting Essex to central London to an image of an Indian railway engine with dozens of people clinging on outside. That year he also shared a photograph of activists from the far right group Generation Identity unfurl a banner that said âStop Islamificationâ from Londonâs Westminster bridge. On Tuesday, Benice Ryley denied the dolls were racist and has since replaced them. Christopher Ryley has been approached for comment. Meanwhile, Chris Philp, the policing minister, speaking about the confiscated dolls, said it was âup to police to decide how they respond to incidentsâ. Asked on LBC why it took five police staff to remove the collection, Philp said: âIâm not going to answer yes or no because theyâre operationally independent and itâs up to police to decide how they respond to incidents, not up to me to tell them what to do or to offer comments after the event.â Sunder Katwala, the director of the integration thinktank British Future, said: âIt is important that police can do their job. These Facebook posts are important because they suggest the intent of displaying the golliwogs is to depict a lynching, or hanging, which takes us into much stronger territory of harassment and racially aggravated hate crime than the impression some people have that they were just teddy bears and golliwogs sitting on a shelf.â He added: âSaying this is just a joke is clearly intended to be quite aggressive and intimidatory.

10,"Australia's Free TV industry group has criticised Facebook's parent company Meta for its handling of scam ads featuring TV stars, claiming the social media giant's response time is inadequate and damages broadcaster reputations. In a submission to a Senate inquiry into digital platforms, the group highlighted several scam ads on Facebook featuring fake endorsements from TV personalities. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has launched a case against Meta, alleging it ""aided and abetted"" celebrity scam ads that have cost Australians hundreds of thousands of dollars. The ACCC has recommended digital platforms verify advertisers to reduce the risk of scams and implement a ""notice-and-action"" mechanism.","Australiaâs broadcast industry group has condemned Facebookâs parent company Meta over its handling of scam ads featuring TV stars including David Koch and Karl Stefanovic, saying the companyâs response time is inadequate and damages broadcaster reputations. Free TV Australia â which represents broadcasters including Seven, Nine and Ten â said in a submission published this month to a Senate inquiry into digital platforms that scam ads featuring their networksâ stars without the network or starâs knowledge or authorisation, and fake news stories had been causing harm to consumers over the past few years. The group highlighted scam ads on Facebook featuring fake endorsements from the Nine news reporter Georgie Gardner for an app, a fake account purporting to be the former Today Show host Allison Langdon encouraging people to enter a scam competition seeking bank details, and scam cryptocurrency ads featuring the Today host Karl Stefanovic and Sunrise host David Koch. âHis image was used as one of many fake celebrity endorsements that baited and lured users into scam bitcoin investments,â Free TV said regarding the fake Koch ads. The group said scammers had also created fake Seven-branded Facebook pages and replied to users in the comment sections on Sevenâs Facebook posts, telling them theyâd won a prize. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission launched a case in the federal court in March last year alleging Meta had âaided and abettedâ celebrity scam ads that had cost some Australians hundreds of thousands of dollars. In its own submission to the inquiry, the ACCC said the losses from scam ads on social networks had almost doubled from a reported $49m in 2020 to $92m in 2021. These figures are likely to be much higher because most victims do not report their losses to Scamwatch. The case had yet to be heard, and Free TV Australia said despite the regulator taking this step, Metaâs takedown processes remained âinadequateâ. âFake ads continue to quickly reappear after they are taken down. These inadequate takedown processes damage the business reputations of broadcasters and also the personal reputations of the celebrities and media personalities that are misrepresented,â the organisation said. âNotwithstanding the significant consumer harm from these scams, in addition to the reputational harm to Free TV members, the digital platforms are persistently slow in responding to takedown requests.â Free TV said the social media platforms should be required to ensure that the content they were publishing was not âfake, damaging, misleading or defamatoryâ, and called for a social media code specifically targeting scam ads. A spokesperson for Meta said scammers were a challenge across the board online, not just limited to social media platforms. âWeâre committed to safeguarding the integrity of our services, and dedicate substantial resources and technology solutions to protect our community from fake accounts and other inauthentic behaviour,â the spokesperson said. In the ACCCâs fifth interim report arising from the digital platforms inquiry in November, the regulator recommended to the government that the digital platforms should appropriately verify advertisers to reduce the risk of scams, and implement a ânotice-and-actionâ mechanism that would require the platforms to take action when a user reports a scam.

11,"Shou Zi Chew, the CEO of TikTok, is facing questioning from US lawmakers amid talk of a possible ban of the social video app in the US. Chew's background is relatively modest, but high marks on a national exam got him into an elite high school, where he added fluency in Mandarin to his native English. He obtained a bachelor's degree in economics from University College London and an MBA from Harvard Business School. He joined ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, as its first CFO in 2021 and was elevated to CEO two months later. Chew is now embarking on a media offensive as part of TikTok's wider efforts to galvanise support to avert a ban in the US and other countries.","Shou Zi Chew has said the most gruelling experience of his life was a five-day survival course in the jungles of Borneo when he was serving as a conscript in Singaporeâs armed forces. The TikTok chief executive, whose trans-global academic and business career has rapidly propelled him to the top job at one of the worldâs biggest tech companies, will need to display some of that mettle as he battles to ensure the corporate survival of the controversial but immensely popular social video app. The 40-year-old Singaporean, who faces questioning by US lawmakers on Thursday amid talk of a possible ban in the US, came from a relatively modest background: his father worked in construction and mother in bookkeeping. His fate was transformed at the age of 12 when high marks on a national exam got him into an elite high school, where he added fluency in Mandarin to his native English. Following his military service â Chew is a reservist officer in the Singaporean army until he is 50 â he obtained a bachelorâs degree in economics from University College London. He stayed on in the UK capital, becoming a banker at Goldman Sachs for two years, investment experience that would eventually lead him to meet a young Zhang Yiming, the founder of TikTokâs parent, ByteDance, when he was developing the company in a crammed apartment in Beijingâs university district. In 2010, Chew gained his MBA from Harvard Business School, where he got his first experience of life in the tech sector with an internship at Facebook while the social networking company was still in startup mode before going public in 2012. It was also where he met his Taiwanese-American future wife Vivian Kao, with whom he has two children. Chew â whose TikTok profile was created in February last year and has just 23 posts, including videos of him attending the Super Bowl and NBA games as well as meeting celebrities such as Bill Murray â does not allow his children to use the app, having said last November that they are âtoo youngâ. After business school, Chew joined the venture capital firm DST, founded by the Israeli-Russian IT billionaire Yuri Milner, where his Mandarin qualified him to be its China-focused partner. This would see him make his pivotal visit to Zhangâs ByteDance in 2012 before the team created TikTok, resulting in Chew and his partners investing in the startup the following year. He also led investment in Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone maker with global ambitions to take on Apple, which he joined as chief financial officer in 2015 at the age of 32. Chew helped to secure financing that led to the companyâs public listing three years later. At the time this was one of Chinaâs biggest ever tech initial public offerings, although its share performance has since been mixed. He was made head of its international business in 2019. In 2021, Zhang persuaded Chew to join ByteDance as its first chief financial officer. Two months later, he was elevated to chief executive following the abrupt departure of the former Disney executive Kevin Mayer after just three months, as the Trump administration attempted to force a sale of TikTokâs US assets. Chewâs rise to the top of the tech industry landed him a spot on Fortuneâs 40 under 40 list in 2021. The low-profile exec is now embarking on a media offensive as part of TikTokâs wider efforts to galvanise support to avert a ban in the US and other countries. âThis could take TikTok away from all 150 million of you,â he said in a post appealing to US TikTok users.",Guardian,23/03/2023,From Facebook intern to the crosshairs of Congress: TikTok chiefâs stellar rise,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/23/tiktok-harvard-graduate-ceo-battles-us-market-shou-zi-chew
12,"A reader of The Guardian's Consumer Champions column has shared their experience of being scammed twice on Facebook Marketplace. The author advises against sending money to unknown sellers and only using PayPal's ""goods and services"" option to protect yourself, even if it incurs a fee. They note that Facebook may not intervene in such cases, and urge buyers to pick up items in person or switch to eBay if they cannot do so.","Within the space of a week I have, admittedly through my own naivety, been ripped off twice on Facebook Marketplace. My daughter wanted a copy of the game The Last of Us for her PlayStation. I found a copy on the site, and contacted the seller. He asked for Â£25 paid by PayPal âfriends and familyâ. I refused at first but in the end relented. The game failed to arrive, and I have had no further contact. The account is still active despite me telling Facebook. The same thing happened to me again with a second purchase. What should I have done? DH, by email It is baffling that people will send money to people they donât know purely on the basis they have posted something for sale on Facebook Marketplace. The online small ads site has boomed in popularity, not least because, unlike eBay, it is free to list items. It has largely replaced small ads in local papers, and the idea is you pick it up in person and hand over the cash. If the item is too far away, and the seller is offering to send it, then alarm bells should ring. Donât send the money as a bank transfer, unless you are happy to take the risk of the item not arriving. In my view, it is unrealistic to think that Facebook will intervene, and consumers should protect themselves. The only way to do it safely is to use PayPal â but not through the friends and family option which is free to both parties â but using the âgoods and servicesâ option. Legitimate sellers wonât mind but they may charge extra to cover the PayPal fee they face. If the item fails to arrive at your registered address you can claim a refund. If that is not an option, donât bother, however much of a bargain. Switch to eBay, or pick it up in person. This applies to Gumtree, too. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

13,"A pro-vaping lobby group, ""Responsible Vaping Australia,"" run by British American Tobacco Australia, has launched a series of ads that targeted those over 18 without disclosing the ads were sponsored by big tobacco. Although Facebook requires groups advertising political or social issues to disclose who paid for the ad, Responsible Vaping Australia failed to do so. Facebook data shows that users aged 18 and above with an interest in nightclubs, pubs, bars and clubbing subculture were the target audience of the ad campaign that ran from 13-19 February. Many of the ads carried no required disclaimers about who funded it. Meanwhile, public health experts say that a blanket ban on the import and sale of vaping products without a prescription needs to be implemented to protect children.","A pro-vaping lobby group has run a series of advertisements targeting those over 18 without disclosing the ads were sponsored by big tobacco, despite Facebook requiring groups advertising political or social issues to disclose who paid for the ad. An initiative of British American Tobacco Australia, âResponsible Vaping Australiaâ emerged in November, and on Facebook describes itself as an âeducation research centreâ. It claims to represent retailers who want to sell vapes responsibly. In late December, just after the federal health minister, Mark Butler, announced the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) had opened sweeping vaping reforms to consultation, Responsible Vaping Australia launched its advertisements. But the ad campaigns, including the latest which ran from 13-19 February, do not target retailers. Facebook data from the February campaign shows users aged 18 and above with an interest in nightclubs, pubs, bars and clubbing subculture were the target audience, and were where the bulk of the advertising spending was directed. Advertisers can select the demographics, interests and behaviours of people they want to see their ads. The ads state that âAustralia needs practical, common sense solutions on vaping policy. The government wants to hear from youâ and link to a petition calling on the government to exempt nicotine vaping products from the Poisons Standard and to allow retailers to sell nicotine vaping products. The latest ad states âAustraliaâs current laws have created an enormous demand for black market vaping productsâ. The ad carried no required disclaimers about who funded it. According to Meta, which owns Facebook, âAdvertisers canât run ads that promote the sale or use of tobacco or nicotine products or related paraphernalia, including, but not limited to: electronic cigarettes, vaporisers or other products that simulate smokingâ. However, the ads were allowed because they promoted âsocial issuesâ tied to vaping. It is unclear how long the ads were allowed to remain public. Only 16 of 31 ads appear to have run with disclaimers. Many of the disclaimers simply say âsponsoredâ without saying by whom. A Meta spokesperson told Guardian Australia: âThese ads were not selling vaping products but promoting social issues tied to vaping to Australians aged 18 and over. Social issues, electoral and political related ads are held to a higher standard and required to include a âPaid for byâ disclaimer. We removed these ads for breaching social issues advertising policy because they did not include this disclaimer.â Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Public health experts say a blanket ban on the import and sale of vaping products without a prescription â whether those products contain nicotine or not â needs to be implemented to prevent importers from dodging import laws and to protect children, who are buying the products from convenience stores where they are not asked for ID. While pro-vaping groups label such a move as âprohibition,â public health groups argue there is nothing prohibitive about allowing adults who are trying to quit smoking access nicotine vaping products with a prescription, in the same way many other medicines and treatments are managed. A tobacco control expert and professor of public health with the University of Sydney, Becky Freeman, said it was misleading for Responsible Vaping Australia to label itself as an education and research group given its clear political agenda. âI donât see any evidence of any âeducation or researchâ in the content of the Facebook page,â Freeman said. âThis is a campaign with financial ties to BAT [British American Tobacco Australia] that is actively lobbying to overturn Australian vaping laws. âFacebook claims to have policies that ban the advertising of tobacco and vaping products, but then openly allow this front group to target young Australians.â Guardian Australia has contacted Responsible Vaping Australia for comment. Despite being an Australia-focused group, most of the administrators of the Responsible Vaping Australia page are in Hong Kong and Pakistan. While public health experts have been complaining to Facebook about the page description since December, after receiving questions from Guardian Australia the Facebook page administrators changed the description from being a âresearch and educationâ group to a âhealth/medical/pharmacyâ group. The âorganisation managing this pageâ section was empty as of Friday. Tobacco control expert Prof Simon Chapman said people should be wary of providing their details to the Responsible Vaping Australia website and petition. âThey donât say how exactly they will use your information,â he said. âThey will have a heap of potential data there for future lobbying, and maybe even for future marketing.â Pro-vaping groups such as Responsible Vaping Australia argue that convenience stores and tobacconists are experienced sellers of nicotine vaping products and are best placed to sell the products to adults. In his submission to the TGA vaping reform consultation, Chapman questioned this, saying retailers already âtotally ignoreâ a ban on selling the products to children. âSignificant proportions of children who vape report it easy to purchase Nicotine Vaping Products,â his submission says. The TGA told Guardian Australia it had received close to 4,000 submissions to the consultation. âThis means that the work to progress the submissions to publication is taking some time, including because it is necessary to redact certain personal information and defamatory content prior to publication,â a TGA spokesperson said. âSubmissions will be published as soon as possible following this process.â Overseas pro-vaping groups are among the submissions. This includes the Coalition of Asia Pacific Tobacco Harm Reduction Advocates (Caphra), which is an affiliate of the Swiss-based International Network of Nicotine Consumer Organisations that has received grants from the Philip Morris-International (PMI)-funded Foundation for a Smoke Free World (FSFW). Caphraâs members include the Hong Kong/Bangkok-based Factasia, which openly states it has received financial support from PMI for many years. It also receives funding from the Australian Taxpayers Alliance, which runs a Legalise Vaping Australia campaign. The World Vapers Alliance â exposed by media organisations Le Monde and the Daily Beast last year as being funded and directed by British American Tobacco â has also made a submission.",Guardian,25/02/2023,Facebook ads opposing a ban on vaping in Australia failed to disclose tobacco company backing,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/26/facebook-ads-opposing-a-ban-on-vaping-in-australia-failed-to-disclose-tobacco-company-backing
14,"Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is testing subscriptions for its social media platforms as its advertising-based business model faces challenges from Apple's privacy changes, EU data laws, and general economic weakness. Under the Meta Verified offering being tested in Australia and New Zealand, users will pay a monthly subscription fee for features such as a verified badge on their account, monitoring service, increased visibility, and personal support. The service is seen as an obvious response to the headwinds on the digital advertising model, and particularly attractive to creators and influencers, although some have criticized the company for charging for basic features.","Mark Zuckerbergâs social media empire is built on billions of users â and the advertisers who pay vast sums to grab their attention. But that business model is under pressure on several fronts. It is against this backdrop that Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said on Sunday it is trialling subscriptions for both social media platforms. âAdvertising has paid for editorial content and other things for centuries,â says Johnny Ryan, a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and a campaigner for stronger protection of internet usersâ data. âI do not see that changing. But the tracking-based ads that snoop on our every move are the historical anomaly, and they are on the way out.â Facebook and Instagram offer a goldmine of user data for advertisers. Facebook alone has 2 billion daily users, while across all of Metaâs platforms including Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger the total is just under 3 billion. Facebook generates revenue from building profiles of those users and matching them with advertisers, who direct ads at people targeting their specific interests and background. This advertising-based model accounted for 98% of Metaâs $116.6bn in revenues last year, but it faces problems. In 2021, Apple introduced privacy changes that required apps sold on the Apple store to ask users permission to track their activity across other apps and the internet â a key means of gathering data for targeted adverts. Of course, many users have opted not to be tracked, and Meta warned that the change would reduce its 2022 ad revenue by $10bn. Regulators loom as well. Last month Metaâs business model was dealt a blow by a ruling that the companyâs legal justification for targeting users with personalised ads broke EU data laws. Meta said the ruling did not prevent targeted or personalised advertising, but it is very clear what the EU, which is a highly influential tech regulator, thinks about Metaâs user data-oriented business model. Then there is general economic weakness, to which any advertising-dependent social media or search company is susceptible. In its most recent quarterly results, Meta reported a 4% drop in revenue while other platforms, including Snap, Google and Elon Muskâs Twitter, have also warned of a weak advertising environment. Musk has launched a revamped Twitter subscription service to offset the company reliance on advertising, although its ad business has also suffered self-inflicted blows. Dan Ives, an analyst at the US financial services firm Wedbush Securities, says launching a subscription service is an obvious response to challenges that have already resulted in Meta announcing plans to cut 11,000 jobs. âMeta is seeing clear headwinds on the digital advertising model and this is a low-hanging-fruit way to potentially pick up some incremental revenue,â he says. Under the Meta Verified offering, users will pay a monthly subscription fee â $14.99 for people using the Facebook or Instagram app on an Apple iPhone or an Android phone, with a lower charge of $11.99 for web access â to enjoy features including: a verified badge on your account, certified by a piece of government ID; a monitoring service to deter account impersonators; increased visibility and reach for your account, such as in search and recommendations; and personal support for problems with your account. It is being tested in Australia and New Zealand and Meta says it hopes to bring the new product to the rest of the world âsoonâ. An obvious market for the service is the creators and influencers who use Metaâs platforms, particularly Instagram. Meta says it will help âup and comingâ creators, adding that âsubscribers with a smaller following may see a more noticeable impact to their reachâ. Kat Molesworth, co-founder of the Creator Union, which hopes to start recruiting members this year, says Meta should not be charging for services she suggests should come as standard: âI would question if itâs appropriate to charge creators, who contribute to Metaâs massive profits, for basic features.â Referring to Google-owned YouTubeâs practice of sharing advertising proceeds with creators, she adds: âYouTube shares revenues pretty much 50/50 with its creators and has done for over a decade. YouTube recognises that without creators it would not have an ad business.â On Sunday, Musk described Metaâs move as âinevitableâ; although whether it is destined to succeed, after nearly two decades of free-access orthodoxy at Zuckerbergâs business, is a different matter.",Guardian,20/02/2023,Does paid-for Facebook and Instagram signal end of free-access orthodoxy?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/20/facebook-instagram-paid-for-signal-free-access-meta

The service will first be rolled out in Australia and New Zealand, costing US$11.99 a month on web or US$14.99 on iOS and Android. It will offer ""extra impersonation protection"", improved reach for verified users, direct access to customer support, and exclusive stickers on Facebook and Instagram stories and Facebook reels. Meta will rely on government ID documents to prove the identity of verified accounts and will not make the service available to businesses. Twitter has restricted SMS-based two-factor authentication to users subscribed to Twitter Blue, sparking concerns over widespread hacks on non-subscriber accounts that use SMS authentication.","Facebook and Instagram users will soon need to pay to be verified on the social media platforms, as Meta follows in the footsteps of rival platform Twitter. Mark Zuckerberg, Metaâs chief executive, announced in a Facebook post on Sunday that the service would first roll out in Australia and New Zealand later this week. The company said it would cost US$11.99 a month on web or US$14.99 on iOS and Android (or, in Australia, $19.99 on web or $24.99 on iOS and Android). Zuckerberg said in addition to a blue badge the service would offer âextra impersonation protectionâ, improved reach for verified users and direct access to customer support. In a blog post, Meta said it would rely on government ID documents to prove the identity of verified accounts, to avoid the embarrassment of accounts impersonating people and brands â as happened when Twitter initially rolled out its paid verification service. Accounts must also have a posting history and users must be at least 18 years old. The service would not be available to businesses at this stage, Meta said. The increased visibility of posts from verified users would âdepend on a subscriberâs existing audience size and the topic of their postsâ, the company said. Those with smaller audiences might see more of an impact.

Meta cut 11,000 staff in November â the equivalent of 13% of its workforce â amid falling ad revenue and economic downturn. The companyâs share price fell by more than 70% in 2022 before a rebound and in July it reported its first ever fall in revenue. Twitterâs CEO, Elon Musk, responded to the news in a tweet saying it was âinevitableâ Meta would follow Twitter. Twitter restricts SMS two-factor authentication to paid accounts Separately, Twitter announced on Friday it would provide SMS-based two-factor authentication only to users who are subscribed to the US$8-a-month ($11.65) Twitter Blue service from 20 March. The company currently provides free two-factor authentication through third-party apps and a security key, which are considered more secure than SMS-based systems. If non-subscriber accounts that use SMS authentication do not switch before the deadline, Twitter said it would disable two-factor authentication for that account. The move has sparked concerns that it could lead to widespread hacks on accounts next month if they fail to switch over. Twitterâs last transparency report prior to Muskâs takeover shows that as of December 2021, although just 2.6% of active Twitter accounts use two-factor authentication, 74.4% of those use SMS as their method of authentication. Musk has claimed Twitter was being âscammedâ US$60m a year from fake two-factor authentication messages. He separately supported a tweet claiming the scams were being run by telecommunications companies that had set up bot accounts to run the two-factor authentication process to get revenue from the text messages from Twitter.",Guardian,20/02/2023,Facebook and Instagram to get paid verification as Twitter charges for two-factor SMS authentication,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/20/facebook-instagram-paid-meta-verification-twitter-charge-2fa-two-factor-authentication-via-sms

Weeks later, she found the same weaving on eBay and arranged to meet the seller, who gifted her several motivational books and suggested she start her own interiors business. Brown now runs a vintage furniture and home decor business from her home, and the weaving often appears in the background of photos of her furnishings and homewares.","When Jorja Brown moved into a Melbourne rental, owning only a bookshelf and a bed just as the Covid pandemic took hold, she knew furnishing her new home would be a challenge. In her search for essential items, such as a couch, the vintage interiors curator took to the treasure-filled quagmire of Facebook Marketplace, and soon found herself obsessing over a 2 x 1.5m weaving made of pure alpaca wool and depicting a trio of musicians. Unfortunately, sheâd missed the deal. With the piece still on her mind days later, Brown reached out to the seller for more details. âShe couldnât tell me much, just that sheâd bought it while travelling in South America. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning âBut I couldnât stop thinking about it â¦ I even reverse-image searched it [on Google], but nothing came up.â She contacted the seller again. âI asked if sheâd help put me in touch with whoever bought it, but she wouldnât. I had to tell myself: âLet it go, itâs not meant to be.ââ A few weeks later, Brown was scrolling through eBay in search of a dining table. She says her eyes âinstantly lit upâ when she noticed a floor rug in one of the thumbnail photos. Some quick inquiries revealed it was the very same weaving sheâd coveted , already back on the market. âI just love the line work. You donât know what it is at glance and that makes you look at it longer and deeper.â And more serendipity was to come. âI drove out and met [the seller], we ended up chatting for two hours about art and design â he was a curator himself.â After hearing her enthusiasm for transitioning to a new career in interiors, Brown says the seller gifted her several motivational books, and suggested she start with Now is the Time by Patrick Lindsay. âIt took me about six months to get the courage to quit my job, but that book was really the seed,â says Brown. She is now self-employed and runs a vintage furniture and home decor business from her home.

18,"The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has ordered businesses to amend or remove more than 8,500 misleading financial promotions during 2022, more than 15 times the previous year's number, as the use of social media marketing channels and ""fin-fluencers"" directing investment products at younger age groups increased. The FCA also published nearly 1,900 alerts to consumers about potential scammers, up over a third on 2021. Tech companies including Google, TikTok, Facebook, and Twitter have changed advertising policies to ensure that regulated firms are involved in adverts for financial products following FCA intervention. However, the FCA said more needs to be done to protect consumers.","More than 10,000 misleading financial promotions and scams aimed at consumers via social media sites such as Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok have been identified and targeted by the financial watchdog during the past year. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the use of social media marketing channels and the rise of so-called âfin-fluencersâ â particularly directing investment products at younger age groups â exploded last year, resulting in a record number of takedown notices and alerts. The FCA ordered businesses to amend or remove 8,582 promotions during 2022, 15 times the 573 recorded the previous year. It also published almost 1,900 alerts to consumers about potential scammers, up more than a third up on 2021. Google, which owns YouTube, Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, TikTok, Twitter and Microsoftâs Bing have changed advertising policies to ensure that regulated firms are involved in adverts for financial products after FCA intervention. However, the regulator said it was still monitoring whether the companies were effectively blocking illegal adverts. âMore needs to be done by tech companies to protect consumers,â the FCA said. âGiven the substantial number of illegal promotions we continue to identify, our expectation is that every social media platform improves their capability to identify and remove the illegal financial promotions on a proactive basis.â The crackdown included taking action against a company that attempted to take advantage of the cost of living crisis, targeting more than 70,000 online followers that the FCA deemed were potentially vulnerable consumers. An online retail broker with more than 1.1 million UK customers, with a primary market of millennial age investors, was ordered to halt a marketing campaign after the FCA identified âserious concernsâ that its promotions, which used social media influencers, were âtargeting vulnerable customers with significant debtâ. The FCA also sought to get an unregistered cryptocurrency exchange offering products to UK consumers to be shut down, and separately alerted 55 consumers who had been identified on a scammers list targeting consumers who had been searching for loans online. âFinancial promotions must be fair, clear and not misleading,â said Sarah Pritchard, executive director, markets, at the FCA. âThis year, we will continue to put pressure on people using social media to illegally promote investments, which put peopleâs hard-earned money at risk.â The FCA said advances in the technology it uses to identify problem firms and misleading adverts had also fuelled the increase in cases last year. It has hired more than 100 people in roles such as machine learning and data analysis to build automated tools to scan thousands of websites every day. The watchdog said it looked at about 180,000 websites last year, resulting in about 4,500 websites and social media platforms being reviewed. This resulted in 1,441 alerts being issued and 400 of the offending websites being taken down. Last year, the Advertising Standards Authority sent enforcement notices to 50 firms in the cryptocurrency sector warning them that they must clearly explain the risks for potential investors.

19,"Meta has announced that former US president Donald Trump will be allowed to return to Facebook and Instagram. Meta's president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said the risk has ""sufficiently receded"" in the two years since the Capitol riots on 6 January 2021 to allow the ban to be lifted. Trump responded to the news on his own social media network, Truth Social, but it is effectively behind a wall for web users because the company is not accepting new registrations. The move comes as Meta faces financial difficulties and pressures to remain relevant. The decision has been criticised by some who argue that the ""guardrails"" on Trump's posts are insufficient.","Itâs been two years since Donald Trump was banned from Meta, but now heâs back. The companyâs justification for allowing the former president to return to Facebook and Instagram â that the threat has subsided â seems to ignore that in the two years since the ban Trump hasnât changed, itâs just that his reach has reduced. Last week, Metaâs president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, announced that soon Trump will be able to post on Instagram and Facebook. The company said âthe risk has sufficiently recededâ in the two years since the Capitol riots on 6 January 2021 to allow the ban to be lifted. What you might not have been aware of â except through media reports â was Trumpâs response. That is because the former US president posted it on Truth Social, his own social media network that he retreated to after he was banned from the others. And it is effectively behind a wall for web users, because the company is not accepting new registrations. On that platform, Trump is said to have fewer than 5 million followers, compared to 34 million and almost 88 million heâd had on Facebook and Twitter respectively. Metaâs ban meant that Trump wouldnât have space on its platforms during the US midterms elections in 2022, but would anything have been different if Trump had been given a larger audience? As Dan Milmo has detailed, almost half of the posts on Trumpâs Truth Social account in the weeks after the midterms pushed election fraud claims or amplified QAnon accounts or content. But you wouldnât know it unless you were on that platform, or reading a news report about it like this one. If given a larger audience, will Trump resume his Main Character role in online discourse (a role that Twitterâs new owner, Elon Musk, has gamely taken on in the past few months)? Or has his influence diminished? This is the gamble Meta is taking. When Musk lifted Trumpâs ban on Twitter in November after a user poll won by a slim margin, it was easy to read the former presidentâs snub of the gesture as a burn on the tech CEO. But it seems increasingly likely that the Meta decision about whether to reinstate him was looming large in Trumpâs mind. Earlier this month, NBC reported that Trumpâs advisors had sent a letter to Meta pleading for the ban to be lifted, saying it âdramatically distorted and inhibited the public discourseâ. If Trump had gone back to Twitter and started reposting what he had posted on Truth Social, there would have been more pressure on Meta to keep the ban in place (leaving aside the agreement Trump has with his own social media company that keeps his posts exclusive on Truth Social for several hours). Twitter lifting the ban and Trump not tweeting at all gave Meta sufficient cover. The financials Thereâs also the possible financial reasoning. Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters for America, said Facebook is âa dying platformâ and restoring Trump is about clinging to relevance and revenue. For months, Trump has been posting on Truth Social about how poorly Meta is performing financially, and in part trying to link it to him no longer being on Facebook. Meta has lost more than US$80bn in market value, and last year sacked thousands of workers as the company aimed to stem a declining user base and loss of revenue after Apple made privacy changes on its software (Â£). But what of the âguardrailsâ? Metaâs justification for restoring Trumpâs account is that there are new âguardrailsâ that could result in him being banned again for the most egregious policy breaches for between one month and two years. But that is likely only going to be for the most serious of breaches â such as glorifying those committing violence. Clegg indicated that if Trump is posting QAnon-adjacent content, for example, his reach will be limited on those posts. The ban itself was a pretty sufficient reach limiter, but we will have to see what happens if Trump starts posting again. The unpublished draft document from staff on the January 6 committee, reported by the Washington Post last week, was pretty telling about Meta, and social media companies generally. It states that both Facebook and Twitter, under its former management, were sensitive to claims that conservative political speech was being suppressed. âFear of reprisal and accusations of censorship from the political right compromised policy, process, and decision-making. This was especially true at Facebook,â the document states. âIn one instance, senior leadership intervened personally to prevent rightwing publishers from having their content demoted after receiving too many strikes from independent fact-checkers. âAfter the election, they debated whether they should change their fact-checking policy on former world leaders to accommodate President Trump.â Those âguardrailsâ donât seem particularly reassuring, do they? Is AI really coming for your job? Layoffs continue to hit media and companies are looking to cut costs. So it was disheartening for new reporters in particular to learn that BuzzFeed plans to use AI such as ChatGPT âto create content instead of writersâ. (Full disclosure: I worked at BuzzFeed News prior to joining the Guardian in 2019, but itâs been long enough that I am not familiar with any of its thinking about AI.) But perhaps itâs a bit too early to despair. Anyone who has used free AI to produce writing will know itâs OK but not great, so the concern about BuzzFeed dipping its toes in those waters seems to be overstated â at least for now. In an interview with Semafor, BuzzFeed tech reporter Katie Notopoulos explained that the tools arenât intended to replace the quiz-creation work writers do now, but to create new quizzes unlike what is already around. âOn the one hand,â she said, âI want to try to explain this isnât an evil plan to replace me with AI. But on the other â¦ maybe let Wall Street believe that for a little while.â That seems to be where AI is now: not a replacement for a skilled person, just a tool.

20,"Late night talk show hosts, including Stephen Colbert, Wanda Sykes, Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Meyers have commented on former US president Donald Trump's return to Facebook after his ban. Sykes compared it to ""letting Hannibal Lecter babysit your most delicious child"", while Colbert argued that Meta was punishing everyone by reinstating Trump. Meyers mocked Tucker Carlson's conspiracy theory that classified documents found at former vice president Mike Pence's residence were concocted to make Trump look bad. Kimmel marked the 20th anniversary of his talk show, thanking staff and expressing surprise at the show's longevity.","The Daily Show Wanda Sykes, the Daily Showâs guest host for the week, tore into Metaâs decision to reinstate Donald Trump to Facebook and Instagram on Thursday evening. âI mean, letting Trump back on Facebook is crazy. Youâre just asking for trouble,â she said. âItâs like letting Hannibal Lecter babysit your most delicious child. âBut Facebook is putting him back online anyway, because they say that âthe public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying,ââ she continued, quoting the companyâs public statement on the matter. âAnd to that, let me say: phooey. âWe all know Facebook is losing a ton of money, and they want that Trump attention back,â she explained. âThey need a hit! Trump is their White Lotus. Heâs the Jennifer Coolidge of the internet.â Sykes then offered an experiment to test out Trumpâs return to Metaâs platforms. âI think for the first week, they should only allow him to post cat photos,â she said. âLetâs see how it goes. And if you see a bunch of cats storming the Capitol â although adorable, shut it down.â Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert also lamented Trumpâs return to Facebook. âThatâs a punishment for all of us,â he said. Trumpâs two-year ban on Meta platforms following January 6 has now expired, and Meta determined he could be reinstated because his ârisk to public safetyâ had âsufficiently recededâ. âThe risk has receded because heâs been gone!â Colbert exclaimed, comparing Metaâs logic to thinking, âyou know, between knife thrusts, Jack the Ripper is a pretty chill dudeâ. Upon reinstatement, Trump must follow Metaâs updated community guidelines, which prohibit violence and incitement, fraud and deception, and hate speech. âSo all the former presidentâs love languages,â Colbert quipped. In addition, Meta said since Trump already declared his candidacy for president in 2024, heâs not subject to fact-checking. âMeta! What are you thinking? You canât allow him to post conspiracy theories on Facebook!â Colbert reacted. âThatâs your momâs friendâs job â âfor the last time, Cathy, teenagers are not identifying as gerbils and demanding taxpayer-funded woodchips.ââ Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers mocked Tucker Carlsonâs latest conspiracy theory, this time on how classified documents found at Mike Penceâs Indiana residence were concocted to make Trump look bad. âProbably the craziest reaction to the Pence news has come from Fox host Tucker Carlson,â he explained, âwho concocted an elaborate fantasy where the DoJ asked Pence to look for the documents, assuming he had none, in order to make Trump look bad by comparison, so that they could then prosecute Trump.â Meyers imitated Carlsonâs fallacy-filled delivery: âItâs possible, in fact itâs likely, they were planning on asking Mike Pence to go undercover as Donald Trump. And if that was the plan, how would they do it? Would they have arrested Donald Trump so they could perform an experimental surgery wherein they removed Donald Trumpâs face and swap it with Mike Pence just like they did to John Travolta and Nicolas Cage? âIn reality, the Biden and Pence revelations show this is a lot more commonplace than most of us realized,â Meyers concluded, âand if Trump had just given the documents back when asked, there wouldnât have been a problem.â Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel celebrated the 20th anniversary of his show, which premiered after the Super Bowl on 26 January 2003. âWhy these people at ABC hired me, I still have no idea,â he joked in an emotional monologue. âI feel like at some point, ABC just forgot they were paying the show, like a 24-hour fitness membership, and it went on. âWhen we started, there were no iPhones, there was no YouTube, there was no Uber, no Twitter, no wifi, no Netflix, no Google,â he said. âWe had Nokias and Ask Jeeves and that was it. âWeâve been through two wars, a worldwide pandemic, four presidents, one insurrection, at least three different Kanyes,â he added, displaying a Blockbuster card for the show. âIf you told me we were going to last longer than Blockbuster, I wouldâve sooner believed Iâd be working at Blockbuster in 20 years.â Kimmel got choked up thanking his executive producers, staff, family and âeverybody at ABC who didnât fire me. âEvery day it takes a lot of people to make something this dumb,â he said. âAnd weâve covered a lot of dumb stuff over the past 20 years, from Snooki to Honey Boo Boo, Ken Bone to Sarah Palin, Sanjaya, Clay Aiken, chocolate rain, double rainbow, Stormy Daniels, William Hung, the astronaut diaper lady, Kim Kardashianâs sex tape, Hulk Hoganâs sex tape, Pam and Tommyâs sex tape.

21,"Facebook's decision to allow Donald Trump back on its platform confirms the company's hypocrisy and its inability or unwillingness to learn from past political disasters. Allowing Trump back on the platform signals that neither the past nor a perpetrator's thoughts about the past matter, and deprives citizens of vital information. The decision also reveals Facebook's business model, which optimizes for outrage, and its attempts to create less toxic politics have regularly been reversed because engagement appeared to have declined. However, Facebook's business model and social media are not the same thing, and every media revolution has created a moral panic, and innovations have also deepened democracy.","It was left to Nick Clegg â once a great hope for liberal politics in Britain, nowadays cutting a sad figure as global lobbyist for a company with major PR problems â to announce that Facebook was open to Donald Trumpâs nefarious business again. The decision was wrong, but it hardly spells the end of democracy, as alarmists equating Facebook with an inevitable triumph for fascism might think. What the decision does, though, is confirm the breathtaking hypocrisy of a corporation seemingly unable â or unwilling â to learn from its complicity in repeated political disasters. Hillary Clinton never stopped being pilloried for her âbasket of deplorablesâ speech in 2016. However, the fact is that Trump and plenty of his supporters have said and done things which are deplorable. The really scandalous part was her casual remark that some Americans were âirredeemableâ. But democracy is based on the notion that no one is irredeemable, that we should never give up on fellow citizens, hard as it may be. Those who have engaged in anti-democratic actions must have the chance to convince others that they have changed their ways. Just as it is wrong to deprive felons of voting rights for life, so is it misguided to exclude people from democratic politics forever. The Italian politician Silvio Berlusconi, after years of evading criminal punishment, was eventually sentenced to community service. He was subsequently able to return to politics, even making a bizarre debut on TikTok, where he tried hard to appear youthful and enthuse Italyâs ragazzi despite looking, after multiple facelifts, like a waxwork of himself. But Trump has neither paid any price for various offenses against democracy, nor ever shown the slightest repentance for his role in what Facebook, in its official announcement, gingerly calls âcivil unrestâ (as if we were talking about some general conflagration, with all sides to blame). By allowing him back on, Facebook is signaling that neither the past, nor what a perpetrator thinks about the past, matter. It pretends that, unless Trump is on the platform, citizens have no chance to find out what âthe king of social mediaâ (according to Nigel Farage) is thinking, depriving them of vital information â a patently absurd claim given that Trump remains the most public American who has ever lived. Not only that: AJ Liebling once observed that freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one â if nothing else, freedom to address the public is also guaranteed to those who own a social network. True, if Facebook executives stick to the narrowest justification for restricting speech, they can argue that Trump is not causing imminent violence. But even that is debatable. A recent post by Trump on his own platform, Truth Social, targeted two African American election workers in Georgia, Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss, whose lives had already been made hell by Trumpâs team in 2020. âWhat will the Great State of Georgia do with the Ruby Freeman MESS?â the former president asked. Facebook points to new âguardrailsâ to prevent posts inciting hatred. But the corporation must know full well that far-right politicians have created a trap when it comes to content moderation: having convinced everyone that conservatives are unfairly disadvantaged by âbig techâ, every sanction will be sold to outraged supporters as confirmation that the right is always the victim. If Trump stays on the platform, he wins; if he is removed again for breaking through guardrails, he also wins. And so does Facebook. For all its sanctimonious talk of âopen debateâ and âcommunityâ, its business model is to optimize for outrage; outrage means maximum âengagementâ and hence profit. Facebookâs attempts to create less toxic politics have regularly been reversed because âengagementâ appeared to have declined as a result. Its much-touted oversight board â an impressive body of former politicians, judges and academics â might criticize individual decisions, but cannot determine Facebookâs overall policy. Revealingly, the board distanced itself from the Trump decision immediately, stressing that it had not been involved; it also called for more transparency. But transparency is of course what platforms have always denied to both governments and researchers. On one level, Facebook may know that its business model is irredeemable, since it is bound to produce ever more scandals. The fact that we now call Facebookâs parent company âMetaâ â leaving behind the F-word, with its bad connotations â is an extraordinary PR triumph. (Google never convinced us to say âAlphabetâ, but, then again, while also engaged in comprehensive surveillance and robbing us of data, it was arguably never as evil as Facebook.) There is much generalizing about social media killing democracy. Every media revolution has created a moral panic â the printing press supposedly gave us the wars of religion; radio caused Hitler; TV enabled McCarthyism. But this technological determinism is facile; innovations have also deepened democracy. Social media and Facebookâs business model are not the same thing. The Trump decision demonstrates, though, that Facebook just cannot let go of its âincitement capitalismâ. Jan-Werner MÃ¼ller teaches at Princeton and is a Guardian US columnist.

22,"Facebook and Instagram's decision to allow Donald Trump to return to the platforms has been criticised by civil rights advocates and politicians, who say that it could lead to increased division and hate speech. The social media firm lifted the ban imposed on Trump following the Capitol attack on 6 January and will allow him to post again in the coming weeks. Experts have suggested that Trump's return to the platforms could result in him spreading dangerous misinformation and hate speech once again. Critics of the decision argue that it is primarily for financial benefit, as the company has lost users and value in recent months.","Politicians and civil rights advocates have weighed in on Metaâs decision to allow former president Donald Trump to return to Facebook and Instagram, stating that his presence on the platforms will âfan the flames of hatred and divisionâ. The social media firm has lifted a ban imposed on Trump after the January 6 Capitol attack and will allow him to post again in the coming weeks. Experts in online hate speech say there is no reason to believe Trump will not return to spreading dangerous misinformation and hate speech upon his return. âGiving Donald Trump access to his Facebook account allows him to once again use his platform as a megaphone to spread misinformation about the integrity of our elections, incite violence and stoke the flames of white supremacy,â said Mariana Ruiz Firmat, executive director of racial justice movement Kairos Action. Democratic politicians have also spoken out against the decision, with Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, of Illinois, saying that reinstating Trump âwill only fan the flames of hatred and division that led to an insurrectionâ. Trump was impeached for inciting the January 6 riot, a deadly attempt to overturn his defeat by Joe Biden in the 2020 election. The events also led to his being banned from a number of major social media platforms, including YouTube, Snapchat and Twitter. The Twitter ban was lifted in November, after the site was purchased by the Tesla owner, Elon Musk. Trump has not tweeted since, although he is active on his own social media platform and would-be Twitter rival Truth Social. Google, owner of YouTube, did not respond to a request for comment on whether Trump would be allowed to return, but some experts have suggested that the decisions from Meta and Twitter could set a precedent that leads other platforms to follow suit. In a blog post explaining Metaâs decision, its president of global affairs and former British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the companyâs platforms should be available for âopen, public and democratic debateâ. âThe public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying â the good, the bad and the ugly â so that they can make informed choices at the ballot box,â he said. Clegg also said that Trump would be allowed back with new âguardrailsâ preventing future violations of platform policies. He would, for example, be âpermitted to attack the results of the 2020 election without facing consequencesâ but would face action if he âwere to cast doubt on an upcoming election â like, the 2024 presidential raceâ. Many have argued that Metaâs decision is largely for financial benefit, as the company has floundered in recent months amid a declining user base and huge expenditures on its virtual reality project, the metaverse. The company lost more than $80bn in market value and laid off thousands of employees in 2022. âMeta knows the impact of bringing Trump back â the company knows he will turn Facebook and Instagram into a cesspool of hate, violence, and extremism â but it doesnât care,â said Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters for America. âFacebook is a dying platform, and Meta will do anything to cling to relevance and revenue â even if that means endangering its users and our democracy.â Among Democrats, Adam Schiff, a former House intelligence committee chair, said Trump had âshown no remorse [or] contritionâ for January 6, and Facebook had âcaved, giving him a platform to do more harmâ. Schakowsky added: âThe reinstatement of Trumpâs accounts show that there is no low [Meta chief executive] Mark Zuckerberg will not stoop to in order to reverse Metaâs cratering revenue and stagnant consumer growth, even if it means destroying our democracy.â Eric Swalwell, like Schiff now barred from the intelligence committee by Republican leaders, said: âWe know that [Trumpâs] words have power and they inspire, and then the leaders in the Republican party, like Speaker [Kevin] McCarthy, they donât condemn them. And so when theyâre not condemned, theyâre a green light and open lane for more violence to occur.â But there was support for Meta among some civil liberties groups, who have argued that censoring him is a threat to first amendment rights. Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said: âLike it or not, President Trump is one of the countryâs leading political figures and the public has a strong interest in hearing his speech. âThe biggest social media companies are central actors when it comes to our collective ability to speak â and hear the speech of others â online. They should err on the side of allowing a wide range of political speech, even when it offends.â The debate over Trumpâs accounts has renewed longstanding arguments that individual corporations and executives at their helm should not have such power to moderate public speech. âMeta will always prioritize its profits over the safety of Black and other marginalized communities â which is why vital communications platforms that have monumental impact on our everyday lives should not be led by private companies,â said Ruiz Firmat of Kairos. âIf we want a digital realm that works for all of us, we must put governance of the internet in the hands of users.â Meanwhile, Trump used his own platform, Truth Social, to celebrate, writing: âFacebook, which has lost billions of dollars in value since âdeplatformingâ your favorite president, me, has just announced that they are reinstating my account. Such a thing should never again happen to a sitting president, or anybody else who is not deserving of retribution!â",Guardian,26/01/2023,"Trumpâs return to Facebook will âfan the flames of hatredâ, say experts and politicians",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/26/trump-facebook-return-reaction-democrats
23,"Former US President Donald Trump's return to Facebook and Instagram will bring pressure on the social media platforms to monitor and moderate his posts, following his history of pushing baseless election fraud claims and amplifying QAnon conspiracy theories on his Truth Social account. Nick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister turned president of global affairs at Meta, Facebook and Instagram's parent company, who presided over Trump's reinstatement process, has outlined guidelines to prevent content that ""deligitimises"" an election or is related to QAnon from appearing in users' feeds. Trump risks further suspension if he violates these guidelines, but the decision to lift the ban has been criticised for ""platforming bigotry and divisiveness"".","If Donald Trumpâs activity on his Truth Social account is a reliable indicator of what his return to Facebook and Instagram will unleash, then Nick Clegg is going to be busy. The former US president has used his rightwing social media platform to push baseless claims of election fraud and amplified content related to the QAnon conspiracy multiverse. These were two issues that received a special mention from Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister turned president of global affairs at Meta, Facebook and Instagramâs parent, as he explained the decision to end Trumpâs two-year exile on Wednesday. Clegg, who presided over the Trump reinstatement process, said content that âdeligitimisesâ an upcoming election or is related to QAnon could be blocked from appearing in other peopleâs feeds or have the reshare button removed. He said such content did not violate Metaâs community standards â or content guidelines â but could increase the risk of a repeat of the Capitol riot that got Trump banned in the first place. According to US campaign group Media Matters, nearly half of the posts on Trumpâs Truth Social account in the weeks after the US midterm elections pushed election fraud claims or amplified QAnon accounts or content. If Trump continues in that vein on Facebook and Instagram, then he will immediately hit the âguardrailsâ that Clegg outlined in his post. Metaâs founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, recently described his job as a series of body blows: âItâs almost like everyday you wake up and youâre punched in the stomach.â The reappearance of Trump will almost certainly result in further pressure on his solar plexus, judging by reaction overnight. Campaign groups warned it would be inflammatory, with the Anti-Defamation League saying Meta had chosen to âplatform bigotry and divisivenessâ and that the decision âisnât a matter of free speechâ. If Zuckerberg and Clegg had kept the ban in place, anger from the right of the political spectrum would have been equally loud, of course. But Clegg was clear that free speech was at the forefront of the decision, saying the public âshould be able to hear what their politicians are sayingâ including a candidate for office such as Trump. This reflects Zuckerbergâs belief that Meta is a champion of âfree expressionâ. Clegg reiterated that in his blogpost on Wednesday, using the opening sentence to state: âSocial media is rooted in the belief that open debate and the free flow of ideas are important values.â The measures outlined by Clegg to limit the threat from content that veers towards âthe risk of real-world harmâ are largely already in place. These include a repeat offender policy that applies to public figures who have been banned but then allowed to return: if Trump posts further violating content it will be removed and he could be suspended for between one month and two years. The guidelines on restricting election falsehood and QAnon content are an update on the repeat offender policy. That balance between free speech and real-world harm, and the strength of that repeat offender policy, will be tested when Trump comes back. Although Trump has yet to tweet following his reinstatement to Twitter, he has made clear that he wants to get back on Facebook. In a letter to Meta this month his advisers said the ban âdramatically distorted and inhibited the public discourseâ and should be rescinded. That argument about distorting and inhibiting the public realm, where everyone has a right to feel safe, would be of interest to Ruby Freeman. The former Georgia election worker was subjected to a âdeluge of intimidation, harassment, and threatsâ and was forced to leave her home after Freeman and her daughter were falsely accused of involvement in falsifying ballots in the 2020 presidential election. In a Truth Social post this month, Trump wrote: âWhat will the Great State of Georgia do with the Ruby Freeman MESS? Why not just tell the TRUTH, get rid of the turmoil and guilt, and take our Country back from the evils and treachery of the Radical Left monsters who want to see America die?â Metaâs community standards on bullying and harassment prohibit âcalling for, or making statements of intent to engage in, bullying and/or harassmentâ. If Trump repeats his Truth Social posts on Facebook and Instagram, another ban â or at least pressure to impose one â looms.",Guardian,26/01/2023,Donald Trumpâs Truth Social posts bode ill for his return to Facebook,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/26/donald-trump-truth-social-posts-bode-ill-return-facebook
24,"Facebook and Instagram will lift their ban on former US President Donald Trump's accounts for the first time in two years, according to parent company Meta. However, the company has put in place new ""guardrails"" to prevent repeat offenses, including stronger controls for public figures during times of civil unrest. These rules include restricting their ability to post for up to two years depending on the severity of the violation, and limiting the distribution of certain content. Trump was banned from Facebook and Instagram after the US Capitol riots on 6 January 2021, but Meta has determined that the risk has ""sufficiently receded"" to lift the ban.","Former US president Donald Trump will have the ban on his Facebook and Instagram accounts lifted for the first time in two years, parent company Meta has announced. But what are the âguardrailsâ it says will deter repeat offences, what will it mean for the platform, and what would it take for him to be banned again? Why is Trump being allowed back? In short: the safety situation is not what it was on 6 January 2021, the day of the Capitol riots. Metaâs president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said in a blog post on Wednesday that the company had determined the risk had âsufficiently recededâ, and as a result, the ban would be lifted âin the coming weeksâ. However, Clegg said there would be new âguardrailsâ in place to deter Trump or other public figures from acting in similar ways in future. What are these âguardrailsâ? Meta has updated its policy on restricting accounts that violate the guidelines on Facebook or Instagram, with special rules for public figures during times of civil unrest. Normally people can be restricted from posting for between one and 30 days, but it can be permanent if severe enough or if it comes despite repeated warnings. But public figures will have stronger controls. This includes government officials, political candidates, and people with over a million followers. The types of violations could include inciting or celebrating ongoing violence or civil unrest. The type of violation â and the public figureâs influence over the people involved in the violence â will determine the length of the restriction, which will be between one month and two years. Meta said most violations will put a public figure in a one-month time-out from posting. A serious violation that would result in a one-year ban would be activity such as sharing a link to a statement from a terrorist group after an attack. The more severe the violence or attack, the more likely the ban will be the full two years. Other action might be more mild. Clegg said if, for instance, Trump references QAnon content, the distribution of that content would be limited, and Meta would restrict his ability to advertise. Why was Trump banned from Facebook? Trump was banned from Metaâs Facebook and Instagram platforms after the US Capitol riots on 6 January 2021. Despite the escalating violence on the day, Trump persisted in posting unsubstantiated claims that the 2020 election had been stolen, and praised the violent protesters at the attempted insurrection. In a statement posted to Facebook the next day, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, said it was clear at the time that Trump âintends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of powerâ and the risks of allowing Trump to continue to use the service âare simply too greatâ. A block was placed on Trumpâs accounts indefinitely, but then Meta gave the final decision on whether to keep the ban in place to the Facebook Oversight board â a body designed to make final decisions on Facebookâs moderation activity at armâs length from Meta management. The board ruled that the ban should remain in place, but said the final decision on whether Trump be readmitted should be decided by Meta. The board suggested Meta should decide within six months, but Meta opted to wait two years from the original ban on 7 January 2021. Has Trump been allowed back on any other platforms? In the aftermath of 6 January 2021, Trump was also banned from Twitter, YouTube and Snapchat. So far, only Twitter has lifted its ban. Twitter lifted its ban in November 2022, after the companyâs new owner, Elon Musk, conducted a Twitter poll which elected to remove the ban by a slim majority. Trump has not tweeted since the ban was lifted. He continues to post on his own social media platform, Truth Social. Trump agreed that all posts he makes on the site will have an exclusivity period of six hours before they can be posted on other sites. But that agreement expires in June, and Rolling Stone has reported that Trump is preparing to return to Twitter as he readies his campaign for the 2024 presidential election. Trump Media and Technology Group CEO Devin Nunes has claimed, however, that Trump has âno interestâ in returning to Twitter.",Guardian,26/01/2023,Why is Trump allowed back on Facebook and will Metaâs âguardrailsâ contain him?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/26/why-is-donald-trump-being-allowed-back-on-facebook-instagram-ban-meta-guardrails

The groups expressed concern about Facebook's ability to prevent future attacks on democracy and quell misinformation. The company says there will be new ""guardrails"" in place to prevent further offending, with the former president being subject to suspension for between one month and two years depending on the severity of the violation. Several advocates say Trump should not be given a platform to spread hate and incite violence. Others, including free speech advocates, argue that candidates for political office should be heard by the public.","The news that Meta will allow Donald Trump back on Facebook and Instagram following a two-year ban has been met with fury and indignation among civil rights and online safety advocates. The former US president will be allowed to return to the platforms âin coming weeksâ but âwith new guardrails in place to deter repeat offencesâ, Metaâs president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, wrote in a blogpost explaining the decision on Wednesday. The Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Free Press, Media Matters and other groups expressed concern about Facebookâs ability to prevent any future attacks on the democratic process or quell misinformation. âMake no mistake â by allowing Donald Trump back on its platforms, Meta is refuelling Trumpâs misinformation and extremism engine,â said Angelo Carusone, president and CEO of media watchdog Media Matters for America. âWhen Trump is given a platform, it ratchets up the temperature on a landscape that is already simmering â one that will put us on a path to increased violence.â Trump was removed from Meta platforms after the Capitol riots on 6 January 2021, during which he posted unsubstantiated claims that the election had been stolen, praised increasingly violent protesters and condemned former vice-president Mike Pence even as the mob threatened his life. Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky said reinstating Trumpâs accounts âwill only fan the flames of hatred and division that led to an insurrectionâ. âThe Capitol community is still picking up the pieces from the January 6th insurrection that Trump ignited, and now he is returning to the virtual scene of the crime,â she tweeted. In a statement explaining the decision to allow Trump to return, Clegg said: âThe public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying â the good, the bad and the ugly â so that they can make informed choices at the ballot box.â âIn the event that Mr Trump posts further violating content, the content will be removed and he will be suspended for between one month and two years, depending on the severity of the violation.â Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said that Trump should not be given a platform to âspread hate and incite violenceâ. âThere is no reason to believe the former president will behave differently now that the platform has reversed his ban. This isnât a matter of free speech; there are ample services that Trump can use to spread his message. This is a business decision to platform bigotry and divisiveness to drive clicks and engagement, plain and simple.â Free Press Co-CEO Jessica J. GonzÃ¡lez, described the announcement as a âcowardly and unethical decisionâ that âwill cause incalculable harmâ. She urged Meta to reverse course and said Trump would only continue to use the companyâs âpowerful toolsâ to âspread lies and dangerous rhetoric, and incite violence targeted at disenfranchised communities and his ideological enemiesâ. âMeta must bear full responsibility for any harm that results from todayâs extremely reckless decision,â GonzÃ¡lez said. Meta initially outsourced its decision about whether to remove Trump permanently to its oversight board: a group of appointed academics and former politicians, that operate independent of Metaâs leadership to scrutinise the companyâs moderation decisions. That group ruled in May 2021 that Trumpâs penalties should not be âindeterminateâ, but kicked the final ruling back to Meta, and played no role in his readmission to the platform. Nicolas Suzor, a professor at Queenslandâs University of Technology School of Law and member of the Oversight Board, told the Guardian that the announcement âfollows through on [Metaâs] commitments to us to develop clear and accountable processes in high profile cases like thisâ. âMany other tech companies have not done this work (or have gone backwards recently) and their senior executives still make decisions behind closed doors that impact us all.â However, a group of scholars, advocates and activists calling itself the Real Facebook Oversight Board â operating in opposition to Metaâs board â said the decision, âsends a message that there are no real consequences even for inciting insurrection and a coup.â Some free speech advocates have agreed with Clegg, saying it is appropriate for the public to have access to messaging from political candidates. Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and a former American Civil Liberties Union official, defended the reinstatement. He had previously endorsed the companyâs decision to suspend Trumpâs account. âThis is the right call â not because the former president has any right to be on the platform but because the public has an interest in hearing directly from candidates for political office,â he said in a statement on Wednesday. âItâs better if the major social media platforms err on the side of leaving speech up, even if the speech is offensive or false, so that it can be addressed by other users and other institutions.â American Civil Liberties Union executive director Anthony Romero said Meta was making âthe right callâ by allowing Trump back on to the social network. âLike it or not, President Trump is one of the countryâs leading political figures and the public has a strong interest in hearing his speech,â Romero said in a release. The ACLU has filed more than 400 legal actions against Trump, according to Romero.

26,,"In a highly anticipated decision, Meta has said it will allow Donald Trump back on Facebook and Instagram following a two-year ban from the platforms over his online behavior during the 6 January insurrection. Meta will allow Trump to return âin coming weeksâ but âwith new guardrails in place to deter repeat offensesâ, Metaâs president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, wrote in a blogpost explaining the decision. âLike any other Facebook or Instagram user, Mr Trump is subject to our community standards,â Clegg wrote. âIn the event that Mr Trump posts further violating content, the content will be removed and he will be suspended for between one month and two years, depending on the severity of the violation.â Trump was removed from Meta platforms following the Capitol riots on 6 January 2021, during which he posted unsubstantiated claims that the election had been stolen, praised increasingly violent protesters and condemned former vice-president Mike Pence even as the mob threatened his life. Clegg said the suspension was âan extraordinary decision taken in extraordinary circumstancesâ and that Meta has weighed âwhether there remain such extraordinary circumstances that extending the suspension beyond the original two-year period is justifiedâ. Ultimately, the company has decided that its platforms should be available for âopen, public and democratic debateâ and that users âshould be able to hear from a former President of the United States, and a declared candidate for that office againâ, he wrote. âThe public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying â the good, the bad and the ugly â so that they can make informed choices at the ballot box,â he said. While it is unclear if the former president will begin posting again on the platform, his campaign indicated he had a desire to return in a letter sent to Meta in January. âWe believe that the ban on President Trumpâs account on Facebook has dramatically distorted and inhibited the public discourse,â the letter said. Safety concerns and a politicized debate The move is likely to influence how other social media companies will handle the thorny balance of free speech and content moderation when it comes to world leaders and other newsworthy individuals, a debate made all the more urgent by Trumpâs run for the US presidency once again. Online safety advocates have warned that Trumpâs return will result in an increase of misinformation and real-life violence. Since being removed from Meta-owned platforms, the former president has continued to promote baseless conspiracy theories elsewhere, predominantly on his own network, Truth Social. While widely expected, the decision still drew sharp rebukes from civil rights advocates. âFacebook has policies but they under-enforce them,â said Laura Murphy, an attorney who led a two-year long audit of Facebook concluding in 2020. âI worry about Facebookâs capacity to understand the real world harm that Trump poses: Facebook has been too slow to act.â The Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Free Press and other groups also expressed concern on Wednesday over Facebookâs ability to prevent any future attacks on the democratic process, with Trump still repeating his false claim that he won the 2020 presidential election. âWith the mass murders in Colorado or in Buffalo, you can see there is already a cauldron of extremism that is only intensified if Trump weighs in,â said Angelo Carusone, president and CEO of media watchdog Media Matters for America. âWhen Trump is given a platform, it ratchets up the temperature on a landscape that is already simmering â one that will put us on a path to increased violence.â After the 6 January riots, the former president was also banned from Twitter, Snapchat and YouTube. Some of those platforms have already allowed Trump to return. Twitterâs ban, while initially permanent, was later overruled by its new chief executive, Elon Musk. YouTube has not shared a timeline on a decision to allow Trump to return. Trump remains banned from Snapchat. Meta, however, dragged out its ultimate decision. In 2021, CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained in a post that Trump had been barred from the platforms for encouraging violence and that he would remain suspended until a peaceful transition of power could take place. While Zuckerberg did not initially offer a timeline on the ban, the company punted its decision about whether to remove him permanently to its oversight board: a group of appointed academics and former politicians meant to operate independently of Facebookâs corporate leadership. That group ruled in May 2021 that the penalties should not be âindeterminateâ, but kicked the final ruling on Trumpâs accounts back to Meta, suggesting it decide in six months â two years after the riots. The deadline was initially slated for 7 January, and reports from inside Meta suggested the company was intensely debating the decision. Clegg wrote in a 2021 blogpost that Trumpâs accounts would need to be strictly monitored in the event of his return. How the âguardrailsâ could work Announcing the decision on Wednesday, Clegg said Metaâs âguardrailsâ would include taking action against content that does not directly violate their community standards but âcontributes to the sort of risk that materialized on January 6th, such as content that delegitimizes an upcoming election or is related to QAnonâ. Meta âmay limit the distribution of such posts, and for repeated instances, may temporarily restrict access to our advertising toolsâ, Clegg said, or âremove the re-share buttonâ from posts. Trump responded to the news with a short statement on Truth Social, reposted by others on Twitter, saying that âsuch a thing should never happen again to a sitting presidentâ but did not indicate if or when he would return to the platform. It remains to be seen if he will actually begin posting again on the platforms where his accounts have been reinstated. While he initially suggested he would be âstaying on Truth [Social]â, his own social media platform, recent reports said he was eager to return to Facebook, formally appealing to Meta to reinstate his accounts. But weeks after returning to Twitter, Trump had yet to tweet again. Some have suggested the silence has been due to an exclusivity agreement he has with Truth Social. A report from Rolling Stone said Trump planned to begin tweeting again when the agreement, which requires him to post all news to the app six hours in advance of any other platform, expires in June. Trump has a far broader reach on mainstream social platforms compared with Truth Social, where he has just 5 million followers. Many online safety advocates have warned Trumpâs return would be toxic, and Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill urged Meta in a December letter to uphold the ban. Representative Adam Schiff, a Democrat who previously chaired the House intelligence committee, criticized the decision to reinstate him. âTrump incited an insurrection,â Schiff wrote on Twitter. âGiving him back access to a social media platform to spread his lies and demagoguery is dangerous.â Trumpâs account has remained online even after his ban, but he had been unable to publish new posts. Civil rights groups say that regardless of the former presidentâs future actions the Meta decision marks a dangerous precedent. âWhether he uses the platforms or not, a reinstatement by Meta sends a message that there are no real consequences even for inciting insurrection and a coup on their channels,â said a group of scholars, advocates and activists calling itself the Real Facebook Oversight Board in a statement. âSomeone who has violated their terms of service repeatedly, spread disinformation on their platforms and fomented violence would be welcomed back.â Reuters contributed reporting",Guardian,26/01/2023,"Trumpâs Facebook and Instagram ban to be lifted, Meta announces",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/25/trump-facebook-ban-lifted-unbanned-instagram-meta-pages-latest

Meta has reportedly set up an internal working group to debate whether the ban should be lifted, with a decision expected in the coming weeks. Trump's accounts on Facebook and Twitter have 34 million and nearly 88 million followers, respectively, while on his own rival social media service, Truth Social, he has fewer than 5 million followers.","Donald Trump has petitioned Meta to restore his access to Facebook, as he reportedly looks to shift his 2024 presidential campaign into a higher gear. The former president was banned from Facebook more than two years ago, after his followers attacked the US Capitol in an unsuccessful attempt to stop certification of Joe Bidenâs victory in the 2020 presidential election. In a letter to Meta obtained by NBC News on Wednesday, Trump advisers argued that the ban âdramatically distorted and inhibited the public discourseâ and should be rescinded. Meta said it would âannounce a decision in the coming weeksâ. Their verdict stems from a self-imposed deadline: while Trumpâs ban was initially indefinite, the company later pledged to revisit his accounts in January 2023, two years after the suspension began. The company has reportedly set up an internal working group, bringing together senior figures across the organization, to debate the final decision. Facebook and Twitter banned Trump a day after the January 6 attack, which has been linked to nine deaths including suicides among law enforcement. Trump used his Twitter account to encourage supporters to gather near the Capitol. In a speech before the attack, he urged supporters to âfight like hellâ. He then used Twitter to criticize his vice-president, Mike Pence, for not stopping certification while the attack was in progress. A congressional committee recommended that Trump be criminally charged in connection with the attack, the fate of hundreds of his supporters. Twitter lifted its ban on Trump after Elon Musk bought the platform last year. But Trump has not tweeted since, choosing to remain on his own rival social media service, Truth Social. NBC quoted an anonymous Republican who said Trump had been bragging about eventually returning to Twitter and predicted the ex-president would do so. Trumpâs accounts on Facebook and Twitter have 34 million and nearly 88 million followers respectively. On Truth Social, he has fewer than 5 million followers. Trump used Twitter and Facebook extensively when he ran for the presidency in 2016 and throughout his time in office. Impeached over the Capitol attack but acquitted, Trump announced his 2024 run in mid-November. In doing so he sought to take credit for Republicans winning back the US House in the midterm elections, though their majority was much narrower than expected and many candidates Trump endorsed suffered high-profile defeats. Trumpâs ban sparked fierce debate, with Republicans deriding the move as big tech censorship, while others said it was too little too late. Experts have said that the stakes for his potential return are high, considering his extremist rhetoric and propensity for spreading misinformation have only intensified since he left office. âTrumpâs behavior and language have gotten significantly worse and more extreme since he was first suspended from the Facebook platform,â said James Steyer, the founder and chief executive of online safety organization Common Sense Media. âPermitting him to return now would be a serious affront to our democracy and to Metaâs own publicly declared standards.

28,"Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has been urged to amend its policy banning bare-chested images of women by its oversight board. The board recommended that the company ""define clear, objective, rights-respecting criteria"" when it comes to moderating nudity ""so that all people are treated in a manner consistent with international human rights standards"". The policy has been criticised for being based on a binary view of gender and a distinction between male and female bodies, which makes rules against nipple-baring ""unclear"" when it comes to intersex, non-binary and transgender users. Meta has 60 days to respond publicly to the board's recommendations.","Facebook and Instagramâs parent company could soon free the nipple. More than a decade after breastfeeding mothers first held a ânurse-inâ at Facebookâs headquarters to protest against its ban on breasts, Metaâs oversight board has called for an overhaul to the companyâs rules banning bare-chested images of women â but not men. In a decision dated 17 January, the oversight board â a group of academics, politicians, and journalists who advise the company on its content-moderation policies â recommended that Meta change its adult nudity and sexual activity community standard âso that it is governed by clear criteria that respect international human rights standardsâ. The oversight boardâs ruling follows Facebookâs censorship of two posts from an account run by an American couple who are transgender and non-binary. The posts showed the couple posing topless, but with their nipples covered, with captions describing trans healthcare and raising money for top surgery. The posts were flagged by users, then reviewed and removed by an AI system. After the couple appealed the decision, Meta eventually restored the posts. The board found that âthe policy is based on a binary view of gender and a distinction between male and female bodiesâ, which makes rules against nipple-baring âunclearâ when it comes to intersex, non-binary and transgender users. It recommended that Meta âdefine clear, objective, rights-respecting criteriaâ when it comes to moderating nudity âso that all people are treated in a manner consistent with international human rights standardsâ. âLactivistsâ spent the 2000s attempting to squash the image of breasts as inherently sexual, and the campaign to #FreetheNipple went mainstream in 2013. The phrase entered pop-feminist parlance in 2013 after Facebook took down clips from the actor/director Lina Escoâs documentary Free the Nipple. The campaign gained wide support on college campuses and was championed by celebrities including Rihanna, Miley Cyrus and Lena Dunham. As recently as last week, Florence Pugh addressed wearing a sheer, hot pink Valentino gown on the red carpet, saying: âOf course, I donât want to offend people, but I think my point is: how can my nipples offend you that much?â In 2015, the Los Angeles-based artist Micol Hebron created stickers of male nipples â which are permitted on Instagram â so that female Instagram users could superimpose them over their own to mock the disparity. Hebron was invited to Instagramâs headquarters in 2019 with a group of influencers to talk about the companyâs nipple policy. âDuring that meeting, we learned that there were no transgender people on the content moderation policy team, and I also observed that there were no gender-neutral bathrooms there,â Hebron said. âTo me, that was all I needed to know to understand the conversation of gender and inclusivity was not being had at Meta.â A Meta representative disputed Hebronâs characterization of the event, adding: âMuch has changed since 2019.â But Hebron said she was âexcitedâ that the oversight board had taken up the issue of gender and sex-based discrimination. âBeyond just âletâs let women be toplessâ, which is not at all my interest, I think itâs really important to hold on to the goal of allowing all bodies to have autonomy,â Hebron said. âIt sounds so frivolous to a lot of people to talk about nipples, but if you think about the ways that governments around the world try to control and repress female-identifying bodies, trans bodies or non-binary bodies, itâs not.â Meta âwelcomes the boardâs decision in this caseâ, a representative said in a statement that noted that the coupleâs photos had been reinstated âprior to the decisionâ. âWe are constantly evolving our policies to help make our platforms safer for everyone,â the spokesperson added. âWe know more can be done to support the LGBTQ+ community, and that means working with experts and LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations on a range of issues and product improvements.â Meta has 60 days to respond publicly to the boardâs recommendations. While advocates may welcome the idea of a freer nipple online, questions remain about how Metaâs automated content-moderation systems will be able to enforce a new policy on nipples. A couple fundraising to afford top surgery is not the same as someone soliciting sex online, but the companyâs AI did not recognize the difference in the post at first. So how will these systems be able to tell the difference between a topless post and porn? âContext is everything, and algorithms are terrible at context,â Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism, told the Guardian. âThe interesting question will be the tension over how Meta can create new rules without opening the floodgates to porn, which is why those rules exist in the first place. That ought to be possible, but Iâm skeptical of whether it is if content moderation is automated.â (Bell previously held several positions at the Guardian, including non-executive director of the Scott Trust.) Facebook and Instagram users can also flag posts they believe violate the companyâs policies, as they did for the photo that spurred the boardâs decision. âIt doesnât take a genius to work out that there are certain areas of the culture wars where content moderation gets weaponized,â Bell said. âA post about top surgery should not have been flagged in the first place, but it was. This could have been the actions of an anti-trans bad actor.â Jillian York, an activist and director of international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, added that it was âtrickyâ for companies that use AI to make the right decision in every scenario. âFor instance, itâs not easy for an automated technology to make a decision about who is a topless adult, versus who is a topless child,â she said. âAI may be able to make a determination between a nine-year-old and a 26-year-old, but what about a 17-year-old and an 18-year-old?â Sarah Murnen, the Samuel B Cummings II professor of psychology at Kenyon College, said the Free the Nipple movement had once centered white, cisgender women â but that was changing. âWhen we talked about this as an issue about cis women, it seemed less important, potentially, than it is now with trans people wanting to be open about their bodies, while anti-trans sentiment is at an all-time-high,â she said. Now, Meta has been advised to loosen the restrictive, binary way it polices bodies online. But many are quick to doubt AIâs potential to protect all users. âThatâs the big lesson of all of this: when you create automated systems, youâre going to have consequences for people who are more marginalized, or the minority in society,â said Bell. âThose are the people who are penalized by the application of an algorithm.â",Guardian,18/01/2023,Free the nipple: Facebook and Instagram told to overhaul ban on bare breasts,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/17/free-the-nipple-meta-facebook-instagram

The four men were heading to Pokhara for a trip of a lifetime to visit temples and paraglide in Nepal's famed Annapurna mountain range. The video shows the men laughing and joking before the plane suddenly appears to veer off and crash, with the sounds of the impact captured on the phone camera. The video suggests that the passengers had no warning before the explosion. The crash killed all 68 passengers and four staff on board, including the four Indian friends.","In the moments before Nepalâs deadliest air crash in decades on Sunday, four friends from India who were onboard began excitedly recording the descent on a Facebook live video. They were heading to Pokhara for the trip of a lifetime, intending to visit temples and paraglide in Nepalâs famed Annapurna mountain range. âItâs really fun,â one of the men can be heard on the video surveying the city below as the plane began its descent. The friends can be heard laughing and joking as the camera is turned on a smiling Sonu Jaiswal, a 29-year-old father-of-three, who ran a small business back home in India. All appears calm in the plane, with no emergency announcements or warnings from the pilot or staff. But suddenly, the plane appears to veer off with a loud roar, and the sounds of it crashing to the ground are captured on the phone camera, before the screen is filled with flames. The burning debris of the aircraft is momentarily visible on the screen before it goes black. No voices can be heard after that. The harrowing video indicates that the 68 passengers and four staff onboard the Yeti Airlines flight had no idea the plane was in danger before an explosion just as it was landing. Vishal Koswal, 21, a close friend of the four men heard in the video, confirmed the authenticity of the video. He identified the four men, all from Ghazipur district in the state of Uttar Pradesh, as 29-year-old Jaiswal, 28-year-old Anil Rajbhar, 23-year-old Vishal Sharma and Abhishek Singh Kushwaha, 23, who had left for Nepal on 12 January. Local police also confirmed their identities. Koswal said he had meant to join his four friends on the trip to Nepal but had to stay home after a the death of a relative. During their trip, he had spoken to them many times over video call, including a couple of hours before the crash. âSonu was showing us the mountains around on the call and was clearly excited, so were we,â said Koswal. âHe told me on that call that after landing in Pokhara, they would visit some temples there and then in the evening take a train back home.â He described the four friends as like âbrothersâ and said everyone in the area was âvery emotionalâ. âThis all seems like a nightmare, I still cannot believe we have lost all of them,â he added. âI canât watch that crash video again, it is very hard and painful. A big tragedy has fallen over us.â On Monday, rescuers continued the search to recover the final four bodies from the wreckage. There was no hope for survivors, said the authorities. The prime minister of Nepal declared a national day of mourning on Monday. The group of friends from India were among 15 foreign nationals who were onboard the plane. The flight was carrying 57 Nepalis, five Indians, four Russians, two South Koreans, and one person each from Argentina, Britain, Australia and France. It plunged into a gorge moments before it was due to land at Pokharaâs new international airport. It was Nepalâs worst aviation disaster since 1992, when 167 people died onboard a Pakistan International Airlines flight that crashed on approach to Kathmandu. The fire and thick smoke, as well as the treacherous terrain, made the rescue efforts by police and army officers challenging. Soldiers used ropes and stretchers to retrieve bodies from the 300-metre (1,000ft) deep ravine late into the night on Sunday. âWe have so far sent 63 bodies to the hospital,â said police officer AK Chhetri on Monday. Arun Tamu, 44, who was about 500 metres away from the site where the plane crashed, told AFP news agency he was among those who ran to the site to try to help. âA few of us rushed to see if we can rescue anybody. I saw at least two women were breathing. The fire was getting very intense and it made it difficult for us to approach closer,â he said. Nepalâs air industry has boomed in recent years, carrying goods and people between hard-to-reach areas, as well as foreign trekkers and climbers. But it has also been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance. In May 2022, all 22 people onboard a plane operated by Nepali carrier Tara Air died when it crashed, and in March 2018, 51 people died when a US-Bangla Airlines plane crashed near Kathmandu. The European Union has banned all Nepal airlines from its airspace over safety concerns. â¢ This article was updated on 19 January 2023 to record that one passenger initially listed as Irish, proved to be British.",Guardian,16/01/2023,Nepal plane crash: last moments inside cabin caught on passengerâs Facebook live video ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/16/nepal-plane-crash-facebook-live-video
30,"Facebook is facing a critical decision about whether to reinstate Donald Trump's account or to keep him off the platform permanently. The decision is set to be announced later this month, two years after he was suspended for his actions during the Capitol riots in January 6. Lawmakers, activists and extremism researchers have urged the platform to keep him out, stating that he continues to spread election misinformation and incite violence. If Trump is reinstated, it would set a new precedent for how social media firms balance free speech with content moderation, especially when it comes to world leaders and newsworthy individuals.","Itâs been a little more than two years since Meta suspended Donald Trump from Facebook and Instagram over his actions during the January 6 Capitol riots. Now, a major decision looms â reinstate Trumpâs account, or keep him off the platform for good? Itâs a widely-watched decision that will set a new precedent for how social media firms balance free speech with content moderation, especially when it comes to world leaders and other newsworthy individuals. The announcement â expected later this month stems from a self-imposed deadline. While Trumpâs ban was initially indefinite, the company later pledged to revisit whether to reinstate his accounts in January 2023, two years after the suspension began. The stakes are high, and with Trump announcing his campaign for re-election for 2024, lawmakers, activists and extremism researchers have urged Meta to keep him out. They say the former presidentâs propensity for misinformation and extremist thinking has only intensified since he left office, and fear he could incite further violence if he is allowed to return. âTrumpâs behavior and language have gotten significantly worse and more extreme since he was first suspended from the Facebook platform,â said James Steyer, the founder and CEO of online safety organization Common Sense Media. âPermitting him to return now would be a serious affront to our democracy and to Metaâs own publicly declared standards. The ban should be made permanent.â In December, Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill urged Meta in a letter to uphold the ban, stating that Trump has continued to spread election misinformation and incite violence on his own social platform, Truth Social. âFor Meta to credibly maintain a legitimate election integrity policy, it is essential that your company maintain its platform ban on former president Trump,â the letter said. âBased on Metaâs own statement on standards for allowing Trump back on the platform, his account should continue to be restricted.â The looming decision has also reinvigorated a debate that has been raging for years: how much control should private platforms have over public speech? Legislation regarding the monitoring of hate speech, misinformation and violence have long stalled, leading many to call for more action ahead of the 2024 elections. âThe most critical part of this whole drama is that whole democratic societies are now routinely held hostage to a handful of individuals who have been allowed to own critical digital infrastructure â to control the communication spaces through which society now operates,â said Shoshana Zuboff, author of the Age of Surveillance Capitalism. How we got here The January 6 riots marked a breaking point in the long-standing debate over social media firmsâ role in addressing hate speech and misinformation from public leaders. Many companies allowed Trump to stay on their platforms throughout his time in office despite violations of terms, citing public interest in political figureheadsâ speech. But in the days after the riots, during which he posted in praise of his supporters and condemned Mike Pence even as rioters threatened the then vice-presidentâs life, Trump was banned from Twitter, Snapchat, YouTube and Meta platforms. The decisions heralded a political reckoning, with Republicans complaining of censorship and others saying the bans were too little too late. Twitter said its own suspension of Trump would be permanent, though the platform reversed course and reinstated his account after Elon Musk took over as CEO last year. YouTube said the ban was indefinite, and Snapchat has yet to reinstate his accounts. CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained in a 2021 post that Trump had been barred from the platforms for encouraging violence and that he would remain suspended until a peaceful transition of power could take place. âHis decision to use his platform to condone rather than condemn the actions of his supporters at the Capitol building has rightly disturbed people in the US and around the world,â Zuckerberg said. Shortly after the ban, however, the company punted its decision about whether to remove him permanently to its oversight board: a group of appointed academics and former politicians meant to operate independently of Facebookâs corporate leadership. In May 2021, the board ruled that the penalties should not be âindeterminateâ but kicked the final ruling on Trumpâs accounts back to Meta, suggesting it decide in six months â two years after the riots. While Musk unilaterally decided to reinstate Trump after a brief poll on Twitter, Meta has offered more transparency into its decision, publishing public blog posts about the process and stating new measures will be in place to monitor Trumpâs activity should he return. âWhen the suspension is eventually lifted, there will be a strict set of rapidly escalating sanctions that will be triggered if Mr Trump commits further violations in the future, up to and including permanent removal of his pages and accounts,â Nick Clegg, Metaâs president of global affairs, wrote in a blog post in 2021. The company has set up an internal working group with employees from across the company to make the final decision, according to CNN. While it was initially slated for 7 January, that date has come and gone, leaving many to speculate on the outcome. Meta did not respond to a request for a comment regarding a timeline. What would Trumpâs return mean? If Trump does return, many safety advocates acknowledge that the online landscape has changed significantly since his departure. The market is far more fragmented today, with companies such as Parler and Trumpâs own social media platform Truth Social marketing themselves as censor-free alternatives for conservatives. Trumpâs reach on Truth Social â where he has 5 million followers â pales in comparison to Twitter, where he had more than 88 million followers at the time of his ban. Still, the former president has pledged to prioritize his accounts there, in part due to an exclusivity agreement that requires him to post all news to the app six hours in advance of any other platform, according to a May filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nearly two months after his account was reinstated by Musk, the former president has yet to tweet, raising the question of whether he would even return to Facebook if allowed. Trump, for his part, appears to have soured on his preferred platforms of the past. In an interview with Fox News, Trump suggested he would not be tweeting again. âI am staying on Truth. I like it better, I like the way it works, I like Elon, but Iâm staying on Truth,â he said. In the aftermath of his removal from Meta platforms, Trump has been highly critical of Facebook and Zuckerberg. âSadly, Facebook has been doing very poorly since they took me off,â he wrote on Truth Social. âIt has lost $750bn in value and has become very boring.â Facebookâs user base has also repeatedly declined over the past year, giving Trump â who had 34 million followers at the time of his suspension â less of an impact if he were to return. âFacebook is significantly less relevant and potent than it was in 2018 and in 2020,â said Angelo Carusone, president and CEO of media watchdog Media Matters for America. âAlthough the harms are not eliminated, its destructive potential is certainly weaker. It matters because it helps inform what to expect.â Despite the shift, experts say recent events have underscored that online misinformation is as dangerous as ever. Social media helped fuel attacks on government buildings in Brazil this week that mirrored the 2021 Capitol riots, highlighting concerns that not enough has changed in the last two years. âWe can draw a lot of parallels between these situations, and they tie directly back to how these platforms still play a huge role in the distribution of information and incitement of violence,â said Jelani Drew-Davi, campaign director for digital social justice firm Kairos. And Trumpâs own rhetoric has only gotten more extreme since his suspension from Facebook, experts say. At least 350 posts of the more than 2,000 Trump made on Truth Social between April and October 2022 would violate Facebookâs Community Standards and warrant removal, according to researchers at Accountable Tech. Those included 116 posts that endorsed QAnon, a conspiracy movement that has been linked to real-world violence and 239 posts casting doubt on US election validity. Despite the diminishing power of Facebook as a platform, a Trump return would directly contribute to the continuing mainstream acceptance of dangerous QAnon ideologies and other conspiracy theories, said Carusone. âWith the mass murders in Colorado or in Buffalo, you can see there is already a cauldron of extremism that is only intensified if Trump weighs in,â he said. âWhen Trump is given a platform, it ratchets up the temperature on a landscape that is already simmering â one that will put us on a path to increased violence.â",Guardian,16/01/2023,Metaâs decision on Donald Trump is looming.

The settlement still needs to be approved by a judge, and Meta did not admit to wrongdoing.","Meta, the Facebook owner, will pay out $725m (Â£600m) to plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit alleging privacy violations related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the company has said in a court filing. The settlement will end a long-running dispute over the revelations that the political consultancy had accessed the data of tens of millions of Facebook users without their consent, and used it to target political adverts. âThis historic settlement will provide meaningful relief to the class in this complex and novel privacy case,â the lawyers leading the case, Derek Loeser and Lesley Weaver, said. They added in a court filing that the settlement âwould be the largest data privacy or data breach class action settlement ever achieved in the United Statesâ, 10% higher again than the next largest â also awarded against Facebook, for signing up users to facial recognition services without their consent. In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said: âWe pursued a settlement as itâs in the best interest of our community and shareholders. Over the last three years we revamped our approach to privacy and implemented a comprehensive privacy programme. We look forward to continuing to build services people love and trust with privacy at the forefront.â The company did not admit to wrongdoing as part of the settlement, which still needs to be approved by a judge. The case revolved around allegations that Facebook had broken state and federal laws by failing to prevent app developers harvesting user data on a widespread basis. Users were misled into believing that the company offered them control over their personal data, the lawsuit argued, when in fact âFacebook, despite its promises to restrict access, continued to allow a preferred list of app developers to access the information of usersâ friendsâ. Facebookâs defence centred on the claim that users could not expect absolute privacy for information they had already posted on the site with the knowledge that it would be shown to their friends. As a result, the company argued, the users had suffered no âtangibleâ harm. That was rejected in 2019 by Judge Vince Chhabria, who said: âFacebookâs motion to dismiss is littered with assumptions about the degree to which social media users can reasonably expect their personal information and communications to remain private. Facebookâs view is so wrong. âSharing information with your social media friends does not categorically eliminate your privacy interest in that information.â At the core of the case are the revelations around Cambridge Analytica, which harvested the data of tens of millions of Facebook users by partnering with a personality quiz operation and using the Facebook API to build extensive profiles on individualsâ behaviour and personalities.

32,"A rare and striking toadstool species, Amanita sculpta, has been rediscovered in Singapore after over 80 years of no sightings. The species was first collected in 1939 in the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and was described as a new species in 1962, but was not seen again until a member of the public posted a photo of the fungus on Facebook in August 2020. Serena Lee, a senior manager at Singapore Botanic Gardens, identified the species and notes that its large size and dark colours help it camouflage in its environment. The rediscovery highlights the importance of biodiversity surveys and public participation in documenting sightings.","âThe cap is like a chocolate chip cookie,â says Serena Lee, senior manager at Singapore Botanic Gardensâ herbarium, describing the top of the sculptured toadstool (Amanita sculpta). âItâs big and chunky, and has a beige and dark brown cap with pileal warts.â Despite its distinctive appearance and a large fruiting body that can range from 10 to 27cm wide, the sculptured toadstool went awol in Singapore for more than 80 years. It was first collected in the 163-hectare (402-acre) Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, one of the first forest reserves to be created in Singapore, in 1939, and was described as a new species in 1962 by botanist EJH Corner, a former assistant director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The toadstool species has been recorded in other parts of Asia, including Malaysia, Thailand, China, Japan and Laos, but is thought to be rare and has been put up for assessment for the IUCN Red List. There were no sightings of the fungus in Singapore until August 2020, when a member of the public posted a photo of a curious-looking toadstool to a Facebook group about the flora of Malaysia and Singapore. âI like exploring different plants and mushrooms that I havenât seen before,â says Serene Toh, who posted the picture. âWhat captured my attention in this case was the toadstoolâs attractive colour and appearance.â Tohâs contribution is seen as a good example of the public assisting scientific research and knowledge, which can aid conservation projects. The photo of the peculiar fungus in its bud stage, which Toh had taken in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, was forwarded to Lee. âMy colleagues from the national parks board of Singapore and I kept an eye out for the species in the nature reserve, although we were uncertain of its exact location,â Lee recalls. âJust a few days later, though â¦ it was seen at the base of a Shorea leprosula tree, along the main road to the summit of Bukit Timah Hill. âIt was a magnificent specimen,â says Lee, who identified the species. âIts cap was 27cm wide â by far the largest non-bracket type macrofungus weâve ever seen in Singapore. Most species of macrofungi in Singapore have caps that are only 1cm to 5cm wide and barely make it past 10cm in height.â It may seem strange that such a striking and ârather hugeâ toadstool could exist but remain unseen for nearly a century. âDespite the large size of its fruiting body, its dark shadowy colours help it to camouflage against the background,â explains Lee. âSo itâs difficult to spot it if youâre not consciously looking for it. It might simply have gone unnoticed over the years.â Since it was ârediscoveredâ in Singapore, the Amanita sculpta has been closely studied. âHaving the material allows us to carry out genetic sequencing to develop a better understanding of the evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships with other species,â says Lee. âThe rediscovery also underscores the importance of biodiversity surveys to take stock of the fungi and other flora and faunal species that can be found in Singapore. It highlights the ability of some species to persist in even a small forest fragment and underscores Singaporeâs commitment to the conservation of key habitats and biodiversity.â Lee is hopeful the publicâs interest in fungi will continue. âWeâve observed growing public awareness and curiosity in fungi when people go on their walks and hikes in Singapore,â she says. âBy raising public awareness of such species, more people can help to look out for them and document any sightings with their phones or cameras,â she says. âSince we started studying them, rediscoveries, new records and even new genus or species have been found. For instance, in 2021, nine plant, fungal and algal species in Singapore were published as new records or rediscoveries, with more than half found in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. âThat means a total of 124 new plant species, new records and rediscoveries in Singapore have been published over the past five years.â Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",Guardian,22/12/2022,Lost and found: how a Facebook post led to the âchocolate chipâ toadstool,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/22/lost-and-found-chocolate-chip-toadstool-amanita-sculpta-aoe

The lawsuit is seeking the creation of a $1.6bn fund for victims of hate speech, with one petitioner stating that his father was murdered after being targeted with racist messages. An investigation in February revealed Facebooks repeated failure to act on posts inciting violence during the conflict in northern Ethiopia, which lasted two years. The lawsuit is also calling for a compensation fund of 200bn Kenyan shillings for victims of hate and violence on Facebook. Amnesty International is among seven organisations supporting the legal action.","Meta has been accused in a lawsuit of letting posts that inflamed the war in Tigray flourish on Facebook, after an Observer investigation in February revealed repeated inaction on posts that incited violence. The lawsuit, filed in the high court of Kenya, where Metaâs sub-Saharan African operations are based, alleges that Facebookâs recommendations systems amplified hateful and violent posts in the context of the war in northern Ethiopia, which raged for two years until a ceasefire was agreed in early November. The lawsuit seeks the creation of a $1.6bn (Â£1.3bn) fund for victims of hate speech. One of the petitioners said his father, an Ethiopian academic, was targeted with racist messages before his murder in November 2021, and that Facebook did not remove the posts despite complaints. âIf Facebook had just stopped the spread of hate and moderated posts properly, my father would still be alive,â said Abrham Meareg, who is ethnic Tigrayan and an academic like his father. âIâm taking Facebook to court so no one ever suffers as my family has again. Iâm seeking justice for millions of my fellow Africans hurt by Facebookâs profiteering â and an apology for my fatherâs murder.â The case is asking for a compensation fund of 200bn Kenyan shillings (Â£1.3bn) to be established for victims of hate and violence on Facebook. In February an analysis by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) and the Observer found that Facebook was letting users post content inciting violence through hate and misinformation, despite being aware that it helped directly fuel tensions in Tigray, where thousands have died and millions been displaced since war broke out in late 2020. The research found that one post from a local influencer, calling for people to âcleanseâ the area of supporters of Tigrayan forces, stayed up for four months after it was reported to the company. The family of Gebremichael Teweldemedhin, a Tigrayan jeweller abducted last December, believe that post and others like it had resulted in many attacks on Tigrayans in Gondar, a city in the Amhara region. Amnesty International is one of seven organisations supporting the lawsuit. âThe spread of dangerous content on Facebook lies at the heart of Metaâs pursuit of profit, as its systems are designed to keep people engaged,â Amnestyâs deputy regional director, Flavia Mwangovya, said. âThis legal action is a significant step in holding Meta to account for its harmful business model.â One of Amnestyâs own staffers, Fisseha Tekle, is a petitioner in the case. âIn Ethiopia, the people rely on social media for news and information,â he said. âBecause of the hate and disinformation on Facebook, human rights defenders have also become targets of threats and vitriol. I saw first hand how the dynamics on Facebook harmed my own human rights work and hope this case will redress the imbalance.â Facebook spokesperson Ben Walters told the Associated Press the company could not comment on the lawsuit because it hadnât received it. He shared a general statement saying: âWe have strict rules which outline what is and isnât allowed on Facebook and Instagram. Hate speech and incitement to violence are against these rules and we invest heavily in teams and technology to help us find and remove this content.â Facebook continues to develop its capabilities to catch violating content in Ethiopiaâs most widely spoken languages, the statement said. Facebook has repeatedly come under fire for expanding into countries with low media literacy, rapidly growing to encompass a large fraction of internet traffic in the area, and failing to devote sufficient resources to moderation in the local languages. That describes its role in Myanmar, where the site faces compensation claims worth more than Â£150bn after legal action was launched in the UK and US last December. Facebook admitted in 2018 that it had not done enough to prevent the incitement of violence and hate speech against the Rohingya, the Muslim minority in Myanmar. An independent report commissioned by the company found that âFacebook has become a means for those seeking to spread hate and cause harm, and posts have been linked to offline violenceâ.

They would require a written complaint to the forum administrator before they could be held liable for defamatory comments, and the changes would come into effect in 2024. The reforms aim to balance protecting free speech with the right of individuals to seek redress in appropriate circumstances for harm caused to their reputation.","Australian media companies may avoid liability for defamatory third-party comments on their social media posts if reforms supported by the nationâs attorneys general become law. The Standing Council of Attorneys General has given in-principle support to reforms to modernise the nationâs defamation laws relating to search engines and social media platforms. In a decision that had ramifications for any Facebook page administrator, the high court said last year media companies could be held liable for allegedly defamatory comments posted to their Facebook pages. The case was sparked after Dylan Voller, whose mistreatment in the Northern Territoryâs Don Dale youth detention centre led to a royal commission, sued some of Australiaâs biggest media groups including the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian and Sky News over posts made by the public on their Facebook pages. The New South Wales attorney general, Mark Speakman, said the amendments, which include a new innocent dissemination defence for internet intermediaries, would substantially upgrade Australiaâs uniform defamation laws. âThe new innocent dissemination defence will be available to a person â other than an author, originator or poster of the matter â who provides or administers the online service by means of which the matter is published,â Speakman told Guardian Australia. âThis will include an individual or organisation who uses a facility on a social media platform to create and administer a public page.â Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Speakman said under the new defence, a person or organisation running a Facebook page would need to receive a written complaint regarding any allegedly defamatory third-party comments before they could be held liable. âOnce the forum administrator has received a complaint, they must take reasonable steps to remove or otherwise prevent access to the matter within seven days in order to rely on the defence,â he said. The changes, which would come into effect in 2024, are aimed at shielding all Facebook page administrators, not just media companies, from defamation lawsuits over posts by third parties. They would provide some relief to media companies in Australia, some of which responded by dedicating more resources for comment moderation on social media, or simply shut off their comments on some posts. In August, when releasing a discussion paper on defamation, Speakman said technology had advanced significantly since Australiaâs uniform defamation laws were drafted 18 years ago. âAlmost anyone can post their views on a wide range of platforms at the touch of a screen or a button,â he said. âIn considering this reform, it is critical that we balance protecting free speech with the right of individuals to seek redress in appropriate circumstances for harm caused to their reputation.â The reforms are a âpragmatic approach that is intended to strike a better balance between protecting reputations and not unreasonably limiting freedom of expression in the various circumstances where third parties publish defamatory matter via internet intermediariesâ, the council said in a communiquÃ©.",Guardian,13/12/2022,Defamation reforms: Australian media may not be liable for Facebook comments in future,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/dec/14/defamation-reforms-australian-media-may-not-be-liable-for-facebook-comments-in-future
35,,"What a difference a year makes. Last October, Facebook supremo Mark Zuckerberg could barely wait to show the world what he was up to. âToday, weâre going to talk about the metaverse,â he enthused in a slick video presentation. âI want to share what we imagine is possible.â Transitioning almost seamlessly from his real self into a computer-generated avatar, Zuckerberg guided us through his vision for the virtual-reality future: playing poker in space with your buddies; sharing cool stuff; having work meetings and birthday parties with people on the other side of the world; customising your avatar (the avatars had no legs, which was weird). Zuckerberg was so all-in on the metaverse, he even rechristened his company Meta. This month, we saw a more subdued Zuckerberg on display: âI wanna say upfront that I take full responsibility for this decision,â he told employees morosely. âThis was ultimately my call and it was one of the hardest calls that Iâve had to make in the 18 years of running the company.â Meta was laying off 11,000 people â 13% of its workforce. Poor third-quarter results had seen Metaâs share price drop by 25%, wiping $80bn off the companyâs value. Reality Labs, Metaâs metaverse division, had lost $3.7bn in the past three months, with worse expected to come. It wasnât all bad news, though: Zuckerberg announced last month that Meta avatars would at last be getting legs. After decades of spectacular âmove fast and break thingsâ growth, Zuckerbergâs empire is now looking a little fragile. Metaâs share price has fallen by more than 70% this year. Moneyspinners Facebook and Instagram are losing market share and Gen Z users to fresher rivals like TikTok and Snapchat. Appleâs changes to data privacy last year also decimated revenues â its introduction of an âask not to trackâ option on iPhones has effectively starved Facebook of the lucrative data it uses to target ads. Meanwhile, Meta has invested a staggering $100bn on metaverse research and development to date, $15bn in the past year alone â with apparently little to show for it. Zuckerbergâs newfound metaverse obsession could be seen as a preemptive virtual land grab for what is generally agreed to be the future of the internet. It could also represent an attempted second act, for both the 38-year-old and his somewhat tarnished Facebook brand. But the markets seem to be saying âcount us outâ, and according to reports, just 58% of Metaâs own employees said they understood the companyâs metaverse vision. Comments on the latest lay-offs in an anonymous employee survey included, âthe metaverse will be our slow deathâ and âMark Zuckerberg will single-handedly kill a company with the metaverseâ. If nothing else, Zuckerberg has popularised the term âmetaverseâ, even if he didnât invent it, and definitions of what it means vary. Zuckerberg explained it as âan embodied internet where youâre in the experience, not just looking at itâ. Rather than our current 2D, screen-based internet, in other words, the metaverse will be a 3D virtual space, accessed by either a VR headset or AR (augmented reality) glasses, which superimpose a layer of digital information on top of the visible world. Matthew Ball, tech investor and author of The Metaverse: How It Will Revolutionise Everything, defines the metaverse as âa massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worldsâ, with individual presence and continuity of data. He has to explain it less and less, he says: âA year ago, it was mostly âwhat is the metaverse?â Questions now are a lot more practical: what will be here? When? For whom? How, and why?â The âwhyâ is a particularly good question when it comes to Meta. âYouâre going to be able to do almost anything you can imagine,â said Zuckerberg in his intro video last year. âGet together with friends and family, work, learn, play, shop, create â¦â At the time we were just coming out of the pandemic. Remote working, video calling and e-commerce had suddenly become the norm. âMany people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended,â Zuckerberg said in a recent staff email. âI did, too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.â Post-pandemic, it turned out people still preferred meeting face to face or on a video call to donning a clunky VR headset and dragging your legless avatar into a virtual meeting room. It has been a similar story on the leisure side. Metaâs Quest VR headsets are the market leader, but most buyers are not using them to flock to Metaâs principal app, Horizon Worlds â which the company describes as âa synchronous social network where creators can build engaging worldsâ. Meta set a target of 500,000 Horizon Worlds users by the end of 2022; the current figure is nearer 200,000 â down from 300,000 in February, which suggests many first-time visitors are not returning. It has been criticised for programming bugs, instability, rudimentary graphics and a general sense of boredom. From my own visits to Horizon Worlds, the 3D motion and audio were fine but the graphics were basic, often garish and textureless: a good two decades behind todayâs best video games. The feeling is of a sparsely attended trade fair. Many of Horizon Worldsâ activities felt more like demonstrations: in a perfunctory wild west town, you can shoot a virtual bottle in a virtual saloon with your virtual pistol (with unsatisfyingly lo-fi results) and ride a hobby horse (literally a virtual horseâs head on a broomstick). At the Marvel superheroes world, you can try on various costumes that enable you to fly or shoot lightning bolts, and thatâs about it. There were few people in either the social âhangoutâ areas or the âgamesâ section, and most of the strangers I encountered seemed to be American children. One had the avatar and voice of a 10-year-old girl. Not even the people making Horizon Worlds have embraced it. Memos leaked in October appeared to show the Meta vice-president, Vishal Shah, urging staff to use their own products more. âIf we donât love it, how can we expect our users to love it?â Shah wrote. âEveryone in this organisation should make it their mission to fall in love with Horizon Worlds. You canât do that without using it. Get in there.â Meanwhile, direct competitors such as VRChat and Rec Room are thriving. âItâs pretty clear they are offering something that Meta doesnât,â says veteran games designer Raph Koster, namely better avatars, a wider choices of games and, critically, bigger crowds (Rec Room has an estimated three million monthly users). âNext to those, Meta looks relatively sterile and empty. Thereâs just a lack of sufficient entertainment in there.â Horizon Worldâs numbers are dwarfed by those of online games (most of which are accessible with and without VR headsets). Fortnite attracts 250 million active players a month. Gaming platform Roblox has more 200 million visitors a month and Minecraft 170 million (two-thirds of whom are under 16 â the exact demographic that is turning away from Facebook and other social media). âHistorically, weâve seen that game worlds generally donât have any trouble attracting an audience,â says Koster. This is not a revelation. âBars with a jukebox or a pool table tend to do better than bars without anything. It doesnât change because you digitise the experience.â Unlike Meta, the games industry began with the âwhy?â It was building complex, sophisticated, popular virtual worlds â proto-metaverses â long before the idea caught Zuckerbergâs eye. As such, it is well positioned for a slice of the metaverse pie. Epic Games, for example, whose Unreal game engine (think of it as the âbrainâ of the game; the software framework that builds the reality in real time) powers not only its bestselling Fortnite but hundreds of other games and applications, making it attractive to independent metaverse-builders. In April, Sony and Lego invested $2bn in Epicâs metaverse vision. In January, Microsoft moved to acquire another games giant, Activision Blizzard, makers of World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Call of Duty and Candy Crush, for nearly $70bn (the deal is currently under antitrust review). Having sprung out of social networks like Facebook, Metaâs model is based on âan attention economy, not a fulfilment economyâ, says Herman Narula, head of the British tech company Improbable. Social media prioritises keeping users passively engaged for as long as possible, whereas gaming seeks to provide fulfilling, active experiences. âThereâs a difference between watching an experience and having an experience,â he says. âIf you look at games like Fortnite and Minecraft â¦ what matters is presence; how many things can you do? In Minecraft, you can move anything about it, you can modify the laws, you can be creative. So what matters is creating a highly creative environment, which allows the normal self-expression.â Improbableâs website claims âwe are the metaverse technology companyâ. Among other things (it works with military as well as gaming companies), the company, which Narula co-founded in 2012, is working on connecting various metaverses together, and hosting large numbers of people in virtual worlds. Whereas most multiplayer online games, like Fortnite, never really put more than 100 people together on one server, Improbable has hosted events bringing together 30,000 people in the same virtual space. Unsurprisingly, Narula is optimistic about the metaverse. In his recent book Virtual Society, he writes: âLike the development of writing, or the advent of the computer age, the dawn of the metaverse will be a grand pivot point in the history of humanity.â The metaverse was valued at nearly $23bn last year and is expected to grow nearly 40% a year for the rest of the decade. As the Epic co-founder and CEO Tim Sweeney put it last year: âThe next three years are going to be critical for all of the metaverse-aspiring companies like Epic, Roblox, Microsoft, Facebook [Meta]. Itâs kind of a race to get to a billion users. Whoever brings on a billion users first would be the presumed leader in setting the standards.â The building blocks of the metaverse are coming together, and Meta is working on many of them: hardware like VR and AR devices, data and network infrastructure, social platforms and interfaces, developer and creator ecosystems â all of which require skilled people (in Metaâs recent 11,000-person cull, Reality Labs was relatively unscathed). âWe are creating a new category that requires significantly and abundantly more resources than it takes to create a single product or collection of products,â says a Meta spokesperson. âItâs misguided to categorise our long-term investment as a loss while we are within our initial phases of development.â So no more âmove fast and break thingsâ; now itâs more of a âmove slowly and build thingsâ vibe. From the outset, Zuckerberg said the metaverse would take five to 10 years to arrive, though some, such as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, are saying it is here already. Matthew Ball agrees: âWe have hundreds of millions interacting in 3D virtual worlds each day,â he says, pointing to the likes of Roblox and Minecraft. But it goes beyond gaming: âJohns Hopkins University hospital is now performing surgery with XR [as in âextended realityâ â VR and AR] devices and game engines, while Vancouver airport runs a 3D simulation [a âdigital twinâ of the airport, incorporating real-time information which can be used for training, optimisation, future planning, simulation and testing] and similarly Tesla cars are building a live simulation of San Francisco using Unreal. The pieces are more mature than many give credit, but weâve yet to develop the standards and systems to integrate them in the ways the internet is developed today.â It is unlikely that Meta, or any other big tech company, will âownâ the metaverse, says Ball. âWe often misrepresent the control of big tech,â he says, pointing out that the âBig Fiveâ â Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft â together collect less than 10% of digital revenues, âalthough they exert disproportionate influence over the rest of the internet â¦ It is likely that a similar outcome happens with the metaverse: a handful of vertically and horizontally integrated software and hardware giants amass the substantial share of users, data, revenue, devices, etc, and exert even greater influence. The metaverse is likely to grow big techâs reach, not shrink it.â If Meta does succeed in controlling a substantial slice of the metaverse, though, there are further, deeper concerns. The charge sheet against social media in general, and Facebook/Meta in particular, is extensive: disseminating and amplifying online disinformation and hate speech, unseen and undisclosed political influence, its impact on mental health, the collection and misuse of personal data. âWhatever company owns the metaverse will have better information about crime, better surveillance, better everything than the government will,â says Koster. He points out how much of our lives is already online: our personal records, our rÃ©sumÃ©s, our bank accounts, our friendships, our online movements and behaviours. The metaverse will enable access to even more layers of data: âA lot of the folks who work on the hardware for AR glasses, for example, are concerned about the fact that the glasses can read biometrics off your iris, and that tells them an enormous amount about your medical state, your emotions moment to moment. Virtual worlds are panopticons. The more we digitise the world, thatâs the power weâre handing over to whoever runs that metaverse.â Meta is taking pains to assuage such fears. âThe metaverse is a collective project,â says a spokesperson, âand how to responsibly manage the new types of data that companies may collect is exactly the kind of challenge that needs collaboration and discussion. Itâs not up to any one company to set the rules on this.â All are in agreement that regulation is needed, but judging by how well the internet has been governed so far, the outlook is complicated â potentially liberating; potentially downright dystopian.",Guardian,7/12/2022,âThe metaverse will be our slow death!â Is Facebook losing its $100bn gamble on virtual reality?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/07/metaverse-slow-death-facebook-losing-100bn-gamble-virtual-reality-mark-zuckerberg
36,"Facebook's cross-check system, designed to protect high-profile users from moderation, did not prioritize protecting free speech and civil rights, according to Meta's oversight board. The board found that the system appeared to favor ""business partners"" such as celebrities who generate revenue for the company, while journalists and civil society organizations had ""less clear paths"" to access the program. The board made 32 recommendations, including removing special protection for commercially important accounts if they break content rules frequently and prioritizing moderation of posts that are important for human rights. Meta's president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said the company would respond within 90 days.","A policy designed to protect high-profile Facebook and Instagram users from moderation was structured to satisfy their parent companyâs business interests, Metaâs âsupreme courtâ has found, and did not prioritise protecting free speech and civil rights. The oversight board, which scrutinises moderation decisions on Facebook and Instagram, said the platformsâ âcross-checkâ system appeared to favour âbusiness partnersâ â such as users including celebrities who generate money for the company â while journalists and civil society organisations had âless clear pathsâ to access the programme. âWhile Meta told the board that cross-check aims to advance Metaâs human rights commitments, we found that the program appears more directly structured to satisfy business concerns,â said the board, adding that it had concerns about the âlack of transparencyâ around the programme. It said cross-check grants certain users greater protection than others because content from users on the cross-check list is allowed to stay up while it is vetted by human moderators applying the âfull rangeâ of content policies. Meta described it as a âmistake-prevention strategyâ that protected important users from erroneous content takedowns. Ordinary users, by contrast, are much less likely to have their content reach reviewers who can apply the full range of Metaâs content guidelines. The board said a userâs âcelebrity or follower countâ should not be the sole criterion for receiving the special protection offered by the programme. Meta admitted to the board that criteria for including âbusiness partnersâ on the list included the amount of revenue they generated. Meta also told the board that it exempts some content from takedowns. The company described this system as âtechnical correctionsâ and said it carried out about 1,000 a day. The board recommended that Meta conducted audits of enforcement actions that are blocked under the system. The board added that the technical corrections system is viewed as an âallow listâ or âwhitelistâ. In September last year the Wall Street Journal, using documents disclosed by whistleblower Frances Haugen, reported that Brazilian footballer Neymar had responded to a rape accusation in 2019 by posting Facebook and Instagram videos defending himself, which included showing viewers his WhatsApp correspondence with his accuser. The clips from WhatsApp â also owned by Meta â included the accuserâs name and nude photos of her. Moderators were blocked for more than a day from removing the video, according to the WSJ, while the normal punishment of disabling his accounts was not implemented. An internal document seen by the WSJ said Neymarâs accounts were left active after âescalating the case to leadershipâ. Neymar denied the rape allegation and no charges were filed against the footballer. Citing the Neymar example, the board said that despite Meta saying it had a system for prioritising content decisions, some content still remained online for âsignificant periodsâ while this happened. âIn the Neymar case, it is difficult to understand how non-consensual intimate imagery posted on an account with more than 100 million followers would not have risen to the front of the queue for rapid, high-level review if any system of prioritisation had been in place,â said the board. The board went on to say that the cross-check âbusiness partnerâ category includes users who are likely to generate money for the company, either through formal business relationships or drawing users to Meta platforms. It said due to the âperception of censorshipâ it preferred keeping content up to taking it down. The board said the business partner category was likely to include major companies, political parties and campaigns, and celebrities. The board made 32 recommendations. They included: removing special protection for commercially important accounts if they break content rules frequently; prioritising moderation of posts that are important for human rights; and violating content from cross-check users that is âhigh severityâ should be removed or hidden while reviews are taking place. The board said Meta viewed the risk of a content decision resulting in âescalation at the highest levelsâ to a chief executive or chief operating officer of an organisation as highly sensitive. Such content carries an âextremely high severityâ tag under the cross-check system. It said Meta therefore seemed more focused on business-related consequences for its decisions rather than ones that are human rights-related.

38,,"Facebookâs revenge porn plan is working Would you trust Facebook with your nudes? Would you let a company famous for its somewhat loose approach to data privacy have anything to do with intimate photos of yourself? Five years ago Facebook (which is now Meta) asked Australians for nudes in a pilot effort to develop a tool to stop the non-consensual distribution of intimate images; the response was sceptical to say the least. In a surprising twist, though, it looks like Metaâs tactics to stop revenge porn are actually working. Hereâs how the program, which has been developed in partnership with SWGfL, a UK-based non-profit behind the Revenge Porn Helpline, works. If youâve shared an intimate image with someone and are worried that that person might do something nefarious with it, content moderators at Facebook can âhashâ the image â essentially the picture is assigned a digital fingerprint - without it ever leaving your device. If someone then tries to upload that image to Facebook it can be quickly identified and blocked. Itâs obviously not a magic bullet for stopping revenge porn, and it requires putting a lot of trust in Facebook and accepting that a random content moderator is going to be looking at your naked photos, but it gives people a little bit of control over their images. Since the program first launched in Australia, Bloomberg reports, it has helped more than 12,000 people to hash more than 40,000 photos and videos. That media is prevented from being uploaded across Metaâs social networks, Facebook and Instagram. This week TikTok and the dating app Bumble also signed up the program. âWe now have four platforms [participating], but we need thousands,â SWGfLâs chief executive office told Bloomberg. âThe more we can get ingesting the hashes, the more we can reduce the threat and fear victims experience.â The non-consensual distribution of intimate images is a massive and fast-growing problem. Itâs most often discussed in terms of ârevenge pornâ, but there are multiple disgusting facets to it. âCollector cultureâ, for example, which is when people (usually men) pass around intimate images of women online, is an emerging trend. A senior helpline practitioner at the Revenge Porn Helpline described it as âa dystopian version of PokÃ©monâ where âwomen are prizes to be passed around, shared and traded.â This sort of thing happens on multiple platforms and trying to stop it often feels like a dystopian version of Whac-a-Mole. Tech-based solutions like the program developed by Facebook are helpful, but tech alone canât solve the problem. As Clare McGlynn, a professor of law, told the Guardian, culture change and education are hugely important. âEvidence from studies shows that just as teenage girls are pressured to send nudes, teenage boys are also feeling pressure to get nudes and share them, to gain kudos. Collecting digital trophies is becoming part of being a boy and a man â thatâs what we need to change.â Google isnât upholding its pledge to protect abortion data After Roe v Wade was overturned, Google promised that it would delete sensitive search data related to abortions: for example, searches for the location of abortion clinics. However, a new study by the tech advocacy group Accountable Tech has found Google is falling short. Some experts arenât surprised. âDespite the promises of well-intentioned technologists, it is entirely unsurprising that new experiments are showing that sensitive information connected to abortion is being collected and retained by the advertising giantâ one expert in surveillance told the Guardian. Matt Gaetz associate Joel Greenberg gets prison time for crimes including sex trafficking Greenbergâs case has had widespread attention because the former Florida tax collector is a buddy of Florida congressman Matt Gaetz and has been cooperating with the Department of Justiceâs sex trafficking investigation into Gaetz. Trust in women leaders is falling New data from the Reykjavik Index for Leadership shows an alarming drop when it comes to trust in women leaders. Itâs the first decline in this data-point since measurements started in 2018. Only 47% of respondents from G7 countries said they were âvery comfortableâ having a woman as CEO of a major company in their country, down from 54% last year. Men were a lot more likely than women to be critical of a female leader; one in 10 respondents said that they wouldnât be comfortable with a female CEO. Responses to questions about female political leaders were along the same lines. Do we blame Liz Truss for this? Sort of. One theory for the decline in trust is more women have moved into positions of power, breeding resentment among men. When a high-profile woman fails, sheâs also often held up as an example of why women shouldnât be in leadership. Elon Musk says he will start implanting brain chips in people soon Including himself, apparently. Heâs already got a chip on his shoulder, why not get a chip in his brain?

French delegates to the Unesco conference were very excited about all this; there was a lot of raucous baguette-waving in the room. Not everyone was impressed though. âThis is not a day of celebration,â bread historian Steven Kaplan told CBC. â¢ This article was amended on 8 December 2022. An earlier version said that Metaâs and SWGfLâs new program for dealing with nudes involved sending the images to Facebook moderators. This has been corrected: the pictures are not shared and do not leave the original device â but a process called hashing creates a digital fingerprint.

39,"A high school principal in New South Wales, Australia, has been banned from interacting with students during a police investigation into allegations of historical child sexual abuse involving a student when he was 17 and the teacher was in her late 40s. The mother of the student discovered hundreds of messages dating back around 10 years, and after the young man's death last year, gained access to his social media accounts. The department of education removed the principal from all child-related duties while the claims were investigated. The teacher added the student on Facebook in April of his final year, with initial conversations about marking a quiz he had taken, and soon arranged to meet outside school hours, with hints of physical encounters in messages.","A New South Wales high school principal has been banned from interacting with students while police investigate a claim of alleged historical child sexual abuse of a student when he was 17 and she was in her late 40s. Concern was raised when the studentâs mother discovered hundreds of messages between the pair dating back about a decade, when he was in year 12 and she was a deputy principal. The young man died last year and his mother gained access to his social media accounts this year, discovering the communications and reporting them to police, the department of education and the minister, Sarah Mitchell. The department then took ârisk management actionâ and removed the now principal from âall child-related dutiesâ while the claims were interrogated. Messages seen by Guardian Australia appear to show that the teacher added the student on Facebook in April of his final year of school. Initial conversations included her messaging him to say she had marked a quiz he had taken and he had scored the top of the class, congratulating him on the result. A month later she offered to unlock the school gym whenever he wanted it, saying there is âno way u look like someone who hasnât been able to work out muchâ. Within months the communications appeared to show the pair arranging to meet outside school hours, speaking about kissing and discussing that the teacherâs husband âknows about usâ. It is not known whether the pair had a sexual relationship. In one message the teacher reflected that women of her age âdonât go around falling in luv with 17 yr oldsâ. In June that year she messaged him to say he was âvery fine, very young, very badâ.

Relax, your boyfriend is not born yet,â the graphic read. In the same month, the student asked what he should call her. âI like Miss. The name Miss and you Miss,â he wrote. She replied with a smiling emoji and said âbut donât you think it makes me sound a bit paedophily [sic]â. By early July, messages hint at physical encounters. âThat was not my body â that was my brain interfering,â she wrote. âI can tell you that because every time I have thought about you for the last few months, including now, my body responds ridiculously well. Just not earlier today.â He replies saying his âhips are a bit sore, knees are a bit sore. Good workoutâ. She asked if he had changed his mind about âthis old girlâ before saying she âdidnât think we were going to do that todayâ. She called him a âbadass, cuteassâ and said she had been âhanging out to get a kiss out of you today and next minute â¦â The teacher then insisted she would not tell anyone about what had happened. âDo you have any idea what they would think?â she asked. âMy girlfriends have children older than you.â In another message, the teacher questioned ââ¦what kind of person must I be to do what Iâm doing?â. She said she would marry him âwhen I get out of jail for corrupting youâ. When he responded saying one âcanât corrupt a badassâ, she replied saying that was ânot a defence Iâd be able to use thoughâ. During another conversation she relayed a dream where he picked her up and âtook me out into the countryside somewhere. we just spend the whole day together, hanging outâ, which she said sounded âperfectâ. He replied that he also had dreams about her in which she was naked. She replied that she has those dreams as well. In mid-July, the teacher messaged the student to say her âhusband knows about us and wants it to stopâ and asked to pick him up so they could talk. The next day she contacted him again saying she had to âunfriend you for the moment. I love you.â Upon discovering the messages, the boyâs mother reported her concerns to police and the NSW department of education. The now principal of another high school in NSW was quickly stood down from on-campus duties and police began an investigation. The mother first contacted the department and police about five years ago, while the young man was still alive, after she was told of the alleged inappropriate relationship by another family member. She messaged her son about it but he did not respond. In documents obtained by Guardian Australia, police this year explained to the family that an anonymous report was also lodged the year after the teenager finished school and he had been spoken to at that time. He signed a statement denying anything untoward had happened. The mother was told by police that when she then came forward and wanted them to investigate a few years later, officers reviewed the claims but âgiven the previous signed statement â¦ it was not looked at any furtherâ. She told Guardian Australia she missed her âvery mischievous, very outgoing, very smartâ son. She wanted other parents and former students to be aware of the investigation and did not think the principal should be allowed contact with students again. A spokesperson for the education department confirmed they were âaware of this matterâ. âThe employee concerned is not currently working with students,â the spokesperson said. âFor privacy and confidentiality reasons, we are unable to provide further comment.â A letter to the mother last month from the education minister, Sarah Mitchell, stated the departmentâs professional and ethical standards (PES) investigation was still open and âon hold pending advice from police about criminal chargesâ. âI am assured PES is in regular contact with police and is actively cooperating with, and assisting the officers involved in the matter,â Mitchell wrote. âI understand the department has taken risk management action in the matter, in that the principal has been removed from all child-related duties. âPlease be assured the safety, welfare and wellbeing of children is the departmentâs paramount concern and appropriate action will be taken as soon as possible once the issue of criminal charges is resolved.â A NSW police spokesperson told Guardian Australia that police had âreceived a report of alleged historic child sexual abuse. Inquiries are being conducted by [district police], in partnership with the State Crime Commandâs Child Abuse Squad.â The principal has been contacted for comment. â¢ In Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact the Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800, or Bravehearts on 1800 272 831, and adult survivors can contact Blue Knot Foundation on 1300 657 380.

Tanya OâCarroll has launched a lawsuit against Mark Zuckerbergâs Meta alleging it has breached UK data laws by failing to respect her right to demand Facebook stop collecting and processing her data. Facebook generates revenue from building profiles of users and matching them with advertisers who direct ads at people targeting their specific interests and backgrounds. OâCarroll told BBC Radio 4âs Today programme: âThis case is really about us all being able to connect with social media on our own terms, and without having to essentially accept that we should be subjected to hugely invasive tracking surveillance profiling just to be able to access social media.â OâCarroll, a senior fellow at Foxglove, a UK legal campaign group that focuses on accountability in the technology industry, is claiming that Facebook has breached article 21 (2) of UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which gives individuals the right to protest against the processing of their personal data for marketing purposes. OâCarroll said a successful case could set a precedent for millions of Facebook, social media and search engine users. âWith this case, Iâm really using this right thatâs long been there on the law books, but has been up until now not been exercised, which is to simply say âI objectâ, and if we are successful in that then everybody will have that right,â she told the BBC.

41,"The Victorian Labor party spent over $115,000 on a Facebook page named after their opponent, the Liberal leader Matthew Guy, to promote negative ads about his policies and record. The page was the second-biggest political advertiser on Facebook in Australia in the past month before being deleted just a week before election day. The reasons for its deletion are unclear. The Labor party's social media campaign is much larger and more advanced than their opponents, with three times the spending and highly targeted ads on the platform. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has the largest following of any Australian politician on Facebook, with 1 million followers.","The Victorian Labor party spent more than $115,000 on a Facebook page under the name of the Liberal leader, Matthew Guy, to boost paid ads attacking his policies and record in government, before deleting the page just a week out from election day. The circumstances behind the deletion of the page â which was the second-biggest political advertiser on all of Australian Facebook in the past month â are unclear. But it was just part of Laborâs social media campaign, which is vastly larger and more sophisticated than of its Liberal opponents. The government has outspent the opposition by up to three times, and is running far more highly targeted ads on the platform. âEvery advertising dollar thatâs been spent has been thought out, intentional and considered,â a Labor campaign headquarters insider told Guardian Australia. Labor has branded Guy âthe Liberal cuts guyâ in much of its advertising, criticising opposition election policies and decisions he made in government. A website expanding on those messages, thecutsguy.com, carries only a small Labor authorisation message. An accompanying Facebook page, titled Matthew Guy â The Liberal Cuts Guy, began posting ads on 31 October. By 15 November the page had spent $115,893 to boost 1,146 ads, according to Facebook ad library data that showed they were paid for by Victorian Labor. The page itself, as well as its ads, also carried authorisation messages on behalf of Victorian Labor. The page boosted 19 types of ads, all critical of Guy personally. âThe Liberals sacked Matthew Guy after he lost the last election. Now heâs back and so are his plans for cuts,â read one ad, with a link to the âCuts Guyâ website. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In the past 30 days on Facebook, only one political advertiser in the country spent more money on political ads than the page. That was Victorian Laborâs main page, with $237,055 spent. All in all, taking in ads from the page of the premier, Daniel Andrews, Labor has spent at least $393,849 in a month. That compares to about $118,000 spent in ads from the Liberalâs main page ($72,000) and Guyâs official Facebook page ($46,335) in the same period. But by Thursday the âCuts Guyâ page disappeared. Facebookâs ad library reported the page âhas been unpublished or deletedâ. Guardian Australia asked the Victorian Labor party if it had voluntarily removed the page, or if it had been deleted by Facebook. No response was received by publication time. Facebook, the Victorian Electoral Commission and the Victorian Liberals were also contacted for comment. Daniel Andrews himself is arguably the most successful social media user in Australian politics, with 1 million followers on Facebook â outnumbering the prime minister, Anthony Albanese (324,000), and his predecessor, Scott Morrison (781,000), as well as his counterparts in NSW (38,000) and Queensland (342,000). Andrewsâ success in building an online following is attributed to him being an early adopter of social media. His director of media, Sabina Husic, is credited with driving his successful following during his first term in office, creating shareable content linked to pop-culture and trending joke formats, and establishing a clear voice and personal narrative. The cadence to his posts during the pandemic led to an entire Facebook group dedicated to mimicking his updates. The premier has also been known to bypass media â including its scrutiny â in favour of making announcements on social media. The multibillion-dollar, 90km underground Suburban Rail Loop was unveiled on Facebook via a slick promotional video with a dramatic soundtrack. The usual unit of four people in the premierâs team who work on his social media had grown during the election, a Labor HQ insider said, though they wouldnât reveal by how many. They said the campaignâs media focus had largely been on TV, social and online media, rather than âtraditional mediaâ such as newspapers and radio, where Andrews has had a long-running feud with 3AW host Neil Mitchell and News Corpâs Herald Sun.",Guardian,19/11/2022,"Victorian Labor loses âMatthew Guyâ Facebook page after using it for $115,000 worth of attack ads",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/20/victorian-labor-loses-matthew-guy-facebook-page-after-using-it-for-115000-worth-of-attack-ads

Kathy Pennyâs 18-year-old son, Ronaldo, was left in a critical condition when a 49-year-old woman chased him and his friend through Perthâs northern suburbs after it was alleged they had stolen a motorcycle. The woman has pleaded guilty to charges of driving dangerously and causing aggravated grievous bodily harm. âHe was in a coma for six days, with swelling on the brain and bleeding, with a fractured skull and broken femur,â Penny said. âHis injuries are still going to be there permanently, heâs going to be limited for the rest of his life.â Ronaldo has been charged with a number of offences including aggravated burglary and stealing offences. He appeared in court last month and has been remanded to Hakea prison. His 17-year-old friend has also been charged in relation to the incident. Penny said the abuse on social media was âjust hatred and revengeâ. âTheyâre just saying really nasty things. Like he should have died, it was good what happened to him, he deserved it. âFacebook and the social media companies need to put a stop to that â¦ Thereâs over 200 comments.

Facebookâs parent company, Meta, said in a statement none of the comments highlighted in the report would be removed. âWe reviewed the content links shared across and they did not breach our community standards,â the statement said. Penny said no one should break the law, including her son and his friend, but the same applied to the woman who chased them. âItâs against the law,â Penny said. âTwo wrongs donât make a right, but she did not have the right to do what she did.â Penny said she had forgiven the woman and would not respond to online threats or remarks in support of vigilantism. âIf we retaliated, three wrongs wouldnât make a right, so we just have to wait and hopefully justice will prevail. I forgive her but I canât forget what happened.â The incident prompted WAâs police commissioner, Col Blanch, to warn people against taking matters into their own hands. âWeâve seen it many, many times, people taking chase of offenders when theyâve witnessed a crime,â Blanch was quoted as saying in WA Today. âIt can end in tragedy for yourself, other members of the community or the person that you might be chasing.â Perth parents say hostility and violence towards young Aboriginal people accused of being involved in crime is being fuelled by racist comments in Facebook community groups. Verna Anderson, one of Pennyâs daughters, said Aboriginal children, including her 14-year-old brother, had been chased and threatened while simply walking the suburban streets. âThis was just a couple of days ago ... When a white van started following them and came to the park with them. So they all started hiding behind bushes and he got out of the car and he started shouting out at them,â she said. She believed attacks and anti-social behaviour were becoming more common in Perthâs suburbs. âItâs becoming an everyday thing, even I have been chased and harassed.â She said people on social media were becoming emboldened to suspect young people of criminal activities without any evidence. âI think they think that no oneâs going to do anything. Theyâre just going to get away with it. Because weâre Black,â Anderson said. Concerns were raised recently at a meeting between Aboriginal community elders and Blanch and other senior officers. Donna Nelson, who works with children and runs a community basketball program, said young people and their families were afraid. âThe community is feeling unsafe. Parents are certainly feeling unsafe. Aboriginal people are becoming very concerned about what potentially this could lead to if appropriate action isnât taken. âPeople are more worried about their property. Iâm not saying that we condone wrongdoing in any way.

The QPS has apologised for the âsickening and disturbingâ Brisbane city watch house recordings â which included comments that black people should be beaten and buried â and said the incidents are being investigated. The police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, said on Tuesday that the actions of the whistleblower, Steven Marshall, were âexcellentâ and encouraged officers to come forwards with complaints. Marshall says he made the decision to release the recordings to the Guardian, which were published Sunday, after previous attempts to raise separate matters of concern via internal QPS processes resulted in little formal action, while he says he suffered alleged reprisals from colleagues. He says he did complain internally about one of the recordings, as well as submitting all of them to the state commission of inquiry into police responses to domestic and family violence. The inquiry heard several alleged instances where whistleblowers suffered adverse consequences for making a complaint, including officers who said they had been labelled a âdogâ by colleagues. Guardian Australia has seen screenshots of a discussion about the watch house recordings in a private Facebook group for law enforcement officers.

Emails seen by the Guardian confirm Marshall complained internally about the officer who used the term âjigaboosâ and that he previously was dealt with by âlocal management resolutionâ â a remedial discussion with a senior officer â and sent back to work. Marshall says he spoke with the officer in charge of the stateâs watch houses, deputy commissioner Mark Wheeler, last month, though he did not share the recordings at the time. He said he raised his concerns, including about racism and sought help finding a job with a different agency due to ongoing reprisals. He says the request was refused.

But unlike many users publicly grappling with Elon Muskâs new universe, threatening to jump ship (but then lingering on the deck), or trying to muster the energy to migrate to another platform and, ahem, âtootâ, Matt is a social media virgin. Unblemished, unsullied â the 46-year-old has never joined a single social media platform. âIâm not very quick to pick up and run with new technologies,â says Matt from the Victorian town of Geelong, âbut that lag time meant that I began to see things I didnât like about their adoption.â Along with privacy and data concerns, he figured most algorithms encouraged outrage and constant use. Like a true scientist, brevity (and committing casual comments to the public record) also put him off: âI didnât know what could be usefully said in 140 characters.â Twitter might be a social media minnow (29.5% of Australian internet users use it at least once a month, compared to Facebook at 76.8%) but watching people tweeting about whether to stay or go in real time is instructive. Itâs a snapshot of a growing awareness among longtime social media users (and people who still dimly remember a time before the internet) about how vulnerable they are to changing algorithms (and owners) and what drew them to social media in the first place.

Increasingly, Semple wrote about the connection between mental health and crafting, or âthe head stuffâ as she calls it. Joining Instagram initially grew her community in very meaningful ways. But more recently, âevery time Iâd open it I would feel dread, rather than joy. It had become a chore â a stressful, anxiety-ridden ethically-dubious space.â Like many artists recently whoâve built whole careers on the platform, Instagramâs algorithm changes (mainly mirroring the TikTok model of snack-sized video) changed everything. âThe requirements of the algorithm had changed the type of content I was creating,â says Semple. âIt was warping my own creative impulses and my message, by messing with my biology, making me feel that I needed to keep up.â âThe most popular platforms want us to be there with 24/ 7 engagement at all costs,â says Guaio. âThe way social media is built is Las Vegas crazy, super bright and completely addictive.

I started to feel guilty afterwards, like I was addicted and I couldnât stop.â Since quitting, âI donât feel the guilt and the self-loathing I used to get from staring at crap posted by people I barely know â¦ Iâve read three books in the last month which is unheard of for me.â Sinclair Smith has strategically kept a slice of the platform â Facebook Marketplace. âI made a fake profile which has no friends attached and I use that to look at items to buy.â âI am tempted to join the interest groups using my fake profile,â says Sinclair Smith, but sheâs worried it could be âa gateway drugâ. A great rebalancing? Guiao says people are becoming more discerning. âWe are seeing a bit of a move away from the giant, public, mass-market platforms into smaller and more community focused platforms and private messaging like WhatsApp,â he says. âWeâre actually going back to how we naturally communicate in our physical or our real-world social networks.â Guiao says to expect ourselves to disconnect entirely is unrealistic, especially digital natives. âWeâre going be online now for the rest of our lives. But thereâs something to be said for rebalancing it,â says Guiao. How that rebalancing will work for younger users embracing more broadcast platforms like TikTok and YouTube remains to be seen. For users looking to engage with niche topics and communities on those platforms, it can still be like running through a casino looking for the ball pit and ending up at the craps table instead. âThe challenge is that there isnât a viable alternative â¦ even if we wanted to change, itâs very difficult,â says Guiao. Guiao points to Eli Pariserâs work, who talks about the concept of âdigital parks as quiet spaces to gather. How do we build online versions of that? The âLas Vegasâ internet isnât an inevitability.â Remember, these places have existed. âBefore social media, there were community platforms like blogs and forums and all of those things that [were] built for connection, community and collaboration but werenât built to get you addicted.â Matt has no desire to join the party. But heâs still forced to reckon with social media, given that his children, currently seven and nine, will eventually have to confront it. âIn the social lives of younger people, thereâs a very heavy price to pay for not engaging. All I can do is help them to understand that the priorities they have for their own lives are not even remotely aligned with those of these companies.â âI do also worry about the capacity for them to find refuge in their lives.â Most of us wonât ever be as pure as Matt, but we might get smarter at making social media work for us. Maybe tooting doesnât sound so bad after all. *Name has been changed",Guardian,11/11/2022,"The 46-year-old social media virgin: how people ditch Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and survive",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/nov/12/the-46-year-old-social-media-virgin-how-people-ditch-twitter-facebook-and-instagram-and-survive

The changes, which will be announced in the May budget, aim to stamp out the illegal vaping black market and the rise of addiction in children. Current laws allow the purchase of nicotine-based vapes only with a prescription, yet thousands of online providers and convenience stores continue to sell to minors. The reforms also include restrictions on flavours, colours, and other ingredients. Furthermore, the Albanese Government plans to work with the states and territories to eliminate vape sales in retail settings altogether.","Australia is set to ban the importation of most vapes, introduce plain packaging and strip them from convenience store shelves under world-first reforms.
The biggest crackdown on e-cigarettes in Australian history is set to be unveiled in the May budget amid fears vaping has emerged as a serious behavioural crisis in schools across the nation.
Under current laws vapes with nicotine can only be bought with a prescription from a chemist. 
But that hasnât stopped thousands of convenience stores and online providers selling to kids.
Health Minister Mark Butler will unveil the changes on Tuesday under a crackdown that will also involve the states and territories moving to stamp out the growing black market in illegal vaping.
The changes will include tough new laws to:
- Stop the import of non-prescription vapes
- Increase the minimum quality standards for vapes including by restricting flavours, colours, and other ingredients;
- Require pharmaceutical-like packaging;
- Reduce the allowed nicotine concentrations and volumes; and
- Ban all single use, disposable vapes.
But the reforms wonât stop there, with the Albanese Government preparing to work with states and territories to close down the sale of vapes in retail settings, ending vape sales in convenience stores and other retail settings.
Health experts fear the rise of vapes poses a public health crisis with children who vape three times as likely to take up smoking.
Experts claim thousands of children can no longer sit still in class because they are addicted to vaping after smoking âbubblegumâ flavours that secretly contain nicotine.
Health Minister Mark Butler said it was clear that governments had to act.
âVaping was sold to governments and communities around the world as a therapeutic product to help long-term smokers quit,ââ he said.
âIt was not sold as a recreational product - especially not one for our kids. But that is what it has become: the biggest loophole in Australian history.
âOne in six teenagers aged 14-17 has vaped. One in four people aged 18-24 has vaped. By contrast, only one in 70 people my age has vaped.
âAnd when more than a thousand teenagers aged 15 to 17 were asked where they could get vapes, four out of five of them said they found it easy or somewhat easy to buy them in retail stores.
âThis is a product targeted at our kids, sold alongside lollies and chocolate bars.â
Mr Butler said schools were now struggling to deal with the fallout.
âVaping has become the number one behavioural issue in high schools. And itâs becoming widespread in primary schools,â he said.
âOver the past 12 months, Victoriaâs poisons hotline has taken 50 calls about children under 4 becoming sick from ingesting or using a vape.
âUnder the age of 4! Vapes contain 200 toxic chemicals that do not belong in the lungs, the same chemicals youâll find in nail polish remover and weed killer.
âJust like they did with smoking, Big Tobacco has taken another addictive product, wrapped it in shiny packaging and added flavours to create a new generation of nicotine addicts.
 âVapers are three times as likely to take up smoking, which explains why under 25s are the only cohort in the community currently recording an increase in smoking rates.
âThis must end.â
Vape police could be rolled out to monitor the sale of e-cigarettes to children across Australia including on TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram under a plan that will ban most imports and introduce plain packaging.
VicHealth CEO Sandro Demaio, a globally-renowned public health expert and medical doctor, told news.com.au that as soon as the Albanese Government introduced new import bans enforcement could be much tougher at a state level.
âIn many ways this explosion of vaping has really come out of nowhere over just a couple of years,ââ he said.
âBut the reverse is also possible if we ban the advertising of vapes and actually clamp down on the use of social media to promote these products.
âIf we make them less alluring, so they donât they donât come in Froot Loops flavour and look like a highlighter. They donât have unicorns on the side. That will make them far less appealing.
âAnd basically cut off the tap at the border. Those things will absolutely make a huge difference.â
Dr Demaio said that introducing plain packaging was important because that would then allow enforcement to swing into action.
âObviously, we want to close the access and the huge amount of vapes that have been finding their way into the hands of particularly young people,ââ he said.
âSo what needs to happen at the state level is that there needs to be a licensing scheme in every state.
âThe licences themselves would create revenue, which can support enforcement officers, so weâre not relying on police to enforce the measures that we currently have.
âIn theory, theyâre not currently subject to the laws because they donât contain nicotine. But the vast majority do contain nicotine; theyâre just simply not putting in all the packets.
âAnd really, what needs to be done is to say, âWell, if thereâs no flavours, no colours and the only pathway through a prescription, and they, they, they have pharmaceutical packaging, it then makes it much easier for the states to actually enforce it.â
He warned children were being âviciouslyâ exploited.
âWell, whatâs happened over the last few years is that the tobacco industry and the e-cigarette industry, of which thereâs huge overlap, has seen an opportunity to, you know, get another entire generation of Australians addicted to nicotine with a new product. Thatâs flown under the radar,ââ he said.
âThis industry has used young peopleâs social media. These things are all over social media. You can jump on Tik Tok and there are ads for E cigarettes with a âBuy Nowâ button.
âSocial media is under-regulated in this country. They have flooded the market with really cheap imports from overseas that donât declare that they contain nicotine.
âAnd itâs been a combination of social media, weaponising their data on social media and flooding the market with really cheap and highly addictive imports.â",news.com.au,2023-05-01T13:32:48Z,Australian Government announces crackdown on illegal black market vapes,https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/australian-government-announces-crackdown-on-illegal-black-market-vapes/news-story/9771ff97a465a95b49945da68b61fb00

The move aims to differentiate Snapchat from Instagram and TikTok by expanding access to the chatbot, emphasizing the distinction between public and private posts, and offering successful creators a share of revenue generated by their viral content. Users can ask factual questions, request creative content, and engage in conversations with the AI service. The chatbot will also be available in group chats. Snapchat plans to address concerns about age-appropriate advice after criticism during the initial release. Additionally, the platform will introduce new tools for creators, focusing on private communication while allowing for public pages. Eligible creators will receive compensation for their viral success, aiming to support their growth and reduce reliance on external opportunities for income.","Snapchat is releasing its GPT-powered AI chatbot to every user for free, the company announced at its annual developer conference, as it tries to chart a distinctive path between the titans of Instagram and TikTok. That means expanding access to its AI chatbot, doubling down on the distinction between public and private posts, and paying successful creators a share of the revenue their viral content generates. First released for paying members of the social networkâs Snapchat+ subscription service, âMy AIâ shows up as another chat contact in the social networkâs app. Similar to ChatGPT, users can ask it factual questions, request creative content, and have back-and-forth conversations with the service. âIt really deepens our ability to serve our mission of helping people express themselves, learn about the world, live in the moment and have fun together,â said Snapâs vice president of product, Jack Brody. Users will also be able to add My AI to group chats, turning to the virtual assistant for any queries that come up in the course of conversation. Paying users will also be able to send photos to their AI helpers and receive completely AI-generated images in return, Brody said. âThe idea is you snap My AI and it can snap you back,â he added. âIn the early days, most of the experiences are really just fun and playful, and exciting to experiment with. Thereâs certainly opportunities to make that a useful feature as well: one of the things thatâs been fun is snapping it some ingredients and it can send you back a recipe.â My AI was criticised for being inappropriate for the companyâs young users when it was originally released in March. In tests run by the Washington Post, the bot cheerily gave advice to a reporter claiming to be 12 years old about how to plan a âsurprise tripâ with their â30-year-old boyfriendâ where they intended to have sex for the first time. Now that the paid trial period is over, Brody says, the app will be more careful about providing age-appropriate advice. âThis early phase of the rollout has allowed us to address some of the challenges that have come up, like adding age awareness. In 99.5% of cases, its responses do conform to our community guidelines.â Snapchat is also introducing new tools for creators who want to use the platform to go viral. In contrast to bigger rivals like TikTok and Instagram, Snapchatâs focus is on private communication rather than public broadcast, Brody said, but new tools will allow creators to split the difference, running a public page at the same time as posting privately for friends and family. âA lot of other platforms really breed this pressure to to be perfect, and weâve seen that that can lead to creator burnout,â he added. âWhat we hear back from them is that Snapchat is a place where they feel like they can be themselves, where they can post without worrying so much about making sure itâs perfect or perfectly edited.â Almost three years after the company launched its TikTok-style Spotlight feed, alongside a $1m daily prize fund for the most-viewed videos, Snapchat is also doubling down on paying creators for their viral success. Eligible users will need at least 50,000 followers on the app, with 25m views and at least 10 public posts a month, but if they do, the company says itâs committed to helping them build a business and grow their audience â not rely on off-platform opportunities to earn money from their fame.",Guardian,19/04/2023,Snapchat making AI chatbot similar to ChatGPT available to every user,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/19/snapchat-making-ai-chatbot-similar-to-chatgpt-available-to-every-user
1,"During a parliamentary committee, experts from charities revealed that county lines adverts on Instagram and Snapchat, aimed at grooming children and young people, now resemble professional job adverts. The traffickers constantly change their methods to entrap victims, with children as young as seven getting involved in drug running. The charities emphasized the need for social media platforms to take more responsibility, as the professionally designed adverts attract vulnerable young people who believe they are helping their struggling families. London, West Midlands, Manchester, and Merseyside were identified as key areas for county lines activity, with thousands of children and young people being pulled into exploitation each year.","County lines adverts on Instagram and Snapchat designed to groom children and young people now resemble professional job adverts, a parliamentary committee heard on Tuesday. Experts from charities gave evidence to Tuesdayâs cross-party education committee about the constantly evolving scene, with traffickers frequently changing their methods of ensnaring children and young people. Johnny Bolderson, manager at the organisation Catch 22, which helps to support and rescue children and young people groomed into county lines exploitation, told the committee that children as young as seven were now getting involved in drug running. He said: âSocial media platforms need to take more responsibility. Adverts on Instagram and Snapchat for young people to get involved in county lines look professionally done â ârecruitment opportunities availableâ. That has been growing in the last six months. Since Covid, families are struggling, and with really professional advertising young people think they are going to help out their families.â The committee heard that London, West Midlands, Manchester and Merseyside were four of the main areas for county lines activity, and that thousands of children and young people were getting pulled in every year. Rebecca Griffiths, head of the National Counter-Trafficking Service at Barnardoâs, said that the charity had received 300 referrals from various parts of England and Wales in the past three months. âVulnerability is changing all the time. We are seeing much younger children and the modus operandi of traffickers is changing. They are targeting more affluent children. Every child can be exploited criminally,â she said. Some girls have been forced to take on âdebtsâ for their boyfriends they are expected to repay. Children can be given free vapes along with bicycles, sweets, magazines or even free sandwiches to entice them to get involved with county lines groomers. Iryna Pona, policy and impact manager at the Childrenâs Society, said: âVaping is a way of grooming.â According to Bolderson, children can also be reeled in through online gaming platforms where groomers befriend them in internet gaming chatrooms, give them coins to enable them to play more games. The children then owe a debt and find themselves in âdebt bondageâ to the groomers. He said children could be groomed without leaving their bedrooms. Susannah Drury, director of policy and development at the charity Missing People, told the committee that it was partly a public health issue, with a cross-government approach required and children benefiting from early intervention. Of the county lines traffickersâ approach, she said: âThis is a business model thatâs very fluid, very reactive, very agile.â The National Crime Agency has called county lines exploitation âthe most frequently identified form of coerced criminality, with children representing the vast majority of victimsâ.

âA thousand times â¦. YES @dominicpurcell,â she captioned her post.
She and Purcell, 53, debuted their romance and went Instagram-official in November 2022, Page Six reports.
Since then, they havenât been shy about showcasing their love in public and on social media.
âHeaded into the New Year HAPPY @dominicpurcell,â Tish captioned a sweet Instagram post last December. âWishing everyone a safe and magical New Yearâs Eve!â
Born in Britain, Purcell moved with his family to Australia at the age of two and started his acting career here in shows like Home And Away, Raw FM and Heartbreak High.

âThings couldnât be going better for Tish and Dominic,â a source told Us Weekly in February. â[Tish] truly feels like she found her soulmate.â
News of her romance with Purcell came shortly after her ex-husband, Billy Ray Cyrus, officially moved on with Australian singer Firerose.

2,"American rapper Azealia Banks has criticized Australia's music and entertainment industry, calling it ""trash"" and labeling Australian artists as ""untalented/uncultured and unneeded."" In a series of Instagram posts, she expressed her disdain for the Australian music scene, except for a few exceptions. Her criticism seemed to stem from allegations of intellectual property theft by an Australian record label. Banks widened her criticism to encompass the entire Australian music industry, citing cultural dissonance and accusing it of being unimportant in the global music culture. She also referenced Australia's colonial history and treatment of Indigenous peoples as factors contributing to its ""trash"" music and culture.","Azealia Banks has taken a swipe at Australiaâs music and entertainment industry, calling it âtrashâ, while also labelling Australian artists as âuntalented/uncultured and unneededâ.
The American rapper took to Instagram on Monday where she shared several posts ranting about Australiaâs music industry. 
âRealise musical talent is just not in the gene pool,â she wrote.
âAbsolutely no one on earth takes (the Australian music industry) seriously.â
Lamenting at the seemingly endless reserve of talentless Australian performers, Ms Banksâ passionate posts made exceptions for Kylie Minogue, INXS and AC/DC, but called Tame Impala âcheesyâ and Wolfmother âan American rock tribute bandâ. 
No stranger to publicly voicing her grievances with the country and its music scene, the most recent controversy seemingly arose over allegations an Australian record label âcorruptly stoleâ Ms Banksâ intellectual property. 
The singer/rapper/songwriter took to Instagram shortly after reading a piece in The Guardian written by Ben Eltham, who spoke to the hurdles faced by local artists in reaching new audiences in the age of social media. 
Ms Banks said Australian Dance Music record label Sweat It Out incorrectly labelled the genre of her music, implying she was in a vulnerable position when signing the record deal as she was âvery f*cking sickâ at the time. 
Citing âjealousy, racism and desperationâ as the driving force behind Sweat It Outâs âpiss poor remixâ of her new song, âNew Bottegaâ, Ms Banks widened her criticism to capture the entire Australian music industry. 
â(It) is a hip hop record. It is not a dance record,â she said. 
âClearly there is a cultural dissonance here.
âHipHop is the most profitable genre of music in the world right now. EDM (electronic dance music) is f*cking dead.â
Ms Banks went on to say that Australiaâs entertainment industry failed to ârealise how unimportant they are as far as music culture goesâ. 
âAustraliaâs media/music/entertainment industry isnât exactly heralded by the heads of government or anyone in the world as a coveted cultural export,â she said. 
âAustralians donât even want to hear Australian music LOL.â
Ms Banks cited Australiaâs enduring colonial apparatus and its systemic dispossession of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the driving force behind its music and culture being âso trashâ. 
âYâall stomped all the blackness out of Australia â which is why your music exports suck,â she said. 
â(Itâs) one of the most culturally stale white nations on the planet.â 
Her posts comes nearly six months after Ms Banks cancelled an Australian show in 2022 and vowed never to return to the nationâs shores.
Lashing out at event promoters over allegations that they failed to pay her, Ms Banks also took aim at Australian currency, calling it âthird-worldâ. 
The performer also cited a âracistâ incident that occurred during her Sydney show in which a bottle of soft drink was thrown at her on stage, subsequently promising she would not return to the land down under.

7,"Australian musician G Flip and Selling Sunset star Chrishell Stause have tied the knot in a secret wedding ceremony after a year of dating. Stause announced the news on Instagram with a video montage of the couple, expressing her love for G Flip and their talent. Fellow reality TV stars congratulated the couple in the comments. Stause and G Flip initially met in 2021 and reconnected in 2022, eventually going public with their relationship. The surprise wedding comes after Stause previously denied engagement rumors.","Australian musician G Flip and their partner, Selling Sunset star Chrishell Stause, secretly said âI doâ after just one year of dating.
Stause announced the exciting news on her Instagram alongside a video montage of the happy couple, reported Page Six.
âLove doesnât always go as plannedâ¦Sometimes itâs immeasurably better,â the reality TV personality captioned the video, which featured an image of the pair kissing at the altar.
She went on to call the musician â who goes by they/them pronouns â âthe kindest, funniest & most talented hard working people out thereâ.
The song featured in the emotional video is G Flipâs new track, which they wrote about Stause, titled, Iâll Be Your Man.
Several fellow reality TV stars flocked to Stauseâs comments section, congratulating the pair on their nuptials.
âIM DYING!!!!!! Iâve been waiting for this post all day!!!â co-star Emma Hernan wrote. âCovered in goosebumps since the moment I watched! Watching your love is like watching the best love story in the world! I love you both to the [moon] & back!!!!!! CONGRATULATIONSâ
âCongratulations my love! So happy for you two,â former Bachelorette Jojo Fletcher added.
âThis makes me SOO HAPPY,â Too Hot To Handle star Francesca Fargo, who just got engaged, wrote.
Stause and G Flip first crossed paths in 2021 at a Halloween party while they were dating other people. The two then reconnected at another gathering in February 2022 after breaking up with their respective partners.
In fact, the pair ended up kissing at the party, but Stause â who previously dated Selling Sunset boss and co-star, Jason Oppenheim â said she didnât think much of it.
âI had no issue doing something like that, but in my head I [didnât think I] could have a meaningful relationship with somebody â¦â the former soap star, 41, told Vogue Australia. âI definitely still thought I was straight at that party!â
However, less than six months later, the pair went public with their relationship during the Netflix showâs season five reunion episode.
âI recently have been spending a lot of time with someone thatâs very important to me. Their name is G Flip. Theyâre non-binary, so they go by they/them,â Stause said during the episode. âAnd they are an extremely talented musician.â
She went on to explain that the pair really connected after G Flip, 28, asked her to be in their music video for âGet Me Outta Here,â which was about a âchaotic love story.â
During the video, the pair got hot and heavy as they made out in a gas station â which led Stause to re-evaluate her sexuality.
â[It] opened my brain up to the fact that Iâm attracted to energy, not whatever physical thing that people have in their head,â she told Vogue. âI donât have a type.â
Their union comes as a surprise to many given the fact Stause previously denied engagement rumours, claiming her diamond ring on that finger was âjust a ring and nothing else.â
Prior to her relationship with G Flip, Stause was married to This Is Us star Justin Hartley.

While Channel 10 announced the program would not air any earlier than May 8, an insider said any further decisions on the future on the series were the late chefâs familyâs â specifically his wife Lauren Fried â to make.
Filming of the latest season finished several weeks ago, with Zonfrillo flying back from Europe early for promotional interviews for the new series.
Jock had secretly moved to new country
The statement from Ten comes as details have revealed the simple reason Zonfrillo was apart from his family in a Melbourne hotel where he was tragically found dead, just hours before the new season of MasterChef was set to air. 
The popular TV personality had reportedly moved to the Italian city of Rome in the weeks before his death. He had flown back to Australia for the launch of the 15th season of the competition cooking show, where he was a judge. 
A neighbour of Zonfrillo in the Carlton terrace where he and his family had lived told Seven News on Tuesday that Zonfrillo âleft three weeks agoâ.
Carlton resident Stuart Ayer said: âHe left about three weeks ago. Obviously heâs come back and who knows what happened.â
Itâs understood the family journeyed to the European country after filming for the hit culinary TV show concluded about a month ago.
Entertainment reporter Peter Ford wrote on social media on Tuesday evening that Jock âhad actually moved to Rome to liveâ for what âwas to have been an exciting new chapter for the familyâ.
His wife Lauren and their two young children Alfie, 5, and Isla, 2, were still in Rome while Zonfrillo returned to Australia to prepare for the seasonâs launch.
They are believed to be arriving back in Australia late on Tuesday night.

The 46-year-old also has two other adult children from previous marriages, Ava and Sophia, although itâs not suggested they were on the trip with Zonfrilloâs young family.

Zonfrillo appears alongside Australian food critic Melissa Leong and cook Andy Allen in the series, which also features English restaurateur Jamie Oliver as a guest. 
The trio replaced the showâs original judges Matt Preston, George Calombaris and Gary Mehigan in 2020.
The role prompted Zonfrillo to move his family from Adelaide to Melbourne in 2021 due to the judge spending half the year in south Victoria for the showâs filming. 
Previews of the highly-anticipated 15th season had been teasing fans for weeks, with Zonfrillo also posting a promo to his Instagram the night before his death.

âIt has been a bit of a roller coaster after starting when I was really young â I had just finished high school and was on holidays between school and uni when we started,â she told news.com.au.
âI had been working late night and weekend shifts at Pizza Hut during school and making something like $6 an hour, so saving $1000 was a lot for me back then, and I put it all into stock.
âIt was definitely not supposed to be a business â it was just a hobby, but when we first put the shoes online they went viral. I popped them on a Facebook page and it kind of evolved naturally over time.â
Ms Conditsisâ brother William has been with her every step of the way, and she eventually âstole himâ out of uni to work on the business full time, after also dropping out of her own Visual Communications degree to focus on building up the brand. 
Within three years of launching the online business, the pair decided to expand into clothing, and after initially running Babyboo out of Ms Conditsisâ bedroom and taking over âevery inchâ of her parentsâ Baulkham Hills home, it was soon time to expand into a proper warehouse and office.
Today, Babyboo has customers in almost 150 countries around the globe, a team of more than 40 employees and 1.1 million Instagram followers.
Ms Conditsis said one of her secrets to success was really understanding her customers from day one.
âI started bedazzling shoes myself because there were just no products like them out there â¦ I always liked to be the one that stood out with outfits and I realised weâd have to start (making them) ourselves as there was a gap in the market,â she explained.
âIf youâd told me back then weâd be as big as we are today I would have laughed at you â thereâs no way I would have believed it and it is now so much bigger than I ever imagined.
âWe never had a business plan or goal and each year that the business would double would come as a surprise.
âNow itâs more of a structured business with processes and strategies but in the early days it was all trial and error and learning from our mistakes quickly.â
The now-29-year-old said it was a blessing to work so closely with her brother.
âIt has been great to join forces with him â weâre so alike, but have our own strengths and weaknesses that work well together,â she said.
âWill is really good at understanding operations and processes and is very creative as well, and I focus more on the product, brand and social side of things.â
She said the biggest achievement for her personally was building a business from âabsolutely nothingâ with no financial backing to one now valued at $60 million, which has also allowed her to build up a team and community of women who âshare the same passionâ.
âWe empower a lot of women around the world by making them feel good, weâre with hundreds of thousands of women worldwide for all their special occasions,â she said.
âDressing them and making them feel empowered is what gets me up every morning â itâs not just a business, it actually serves a purpose.â
However, it hasnât all been smooth sailing.
Like most retailers, Babyboo took a hit during the Covid pandemic, but was able to quickly pivot and expand into loungewear, which was soon snapped up by those living through brutal lockdowns.
The move saw sales boom â and now, the next step for the thriving business is continuing its international expansion, settling into a new office and warehouse and launching new collections to increase the offering for customers. 
When it comes to advice for other budding young entrepreneurs, Ms Conditsis said it was simple.
âI always say never compare your chapter one to someone elseâs chapter six â eventually, youâll get there, after going through a process of evolving and learning,â she said.
âWhen I was young, there were a lot of people who didnât take me seriously and I got a lot of nos, but I think most of the businesses that will rise in the coming years will be from young people, who are very in tune with social media and have a lot to offer.â",news.com.au,2023-04-21T08:33:59Z,How Argylica Conditsis turned Babyboo Fashion into $60m empire,https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/sydney-woman-turns-1000-pizza-hut-earnings-into-60-million-fashion-empire-in-just-12-years/news-story/b2f4af56e67430fac8a4c5a1f3ce66b6
11,"Transportable Shade Sheds, a shed supplier on the Sunshine Coast, has gone bankrupt, leaving numerous customers and workers unpaid. The Mooloolaba-based company owes over $1.3 million to around 160 trade suppliers and creditors. The business, along with five related entities, ceased trading prior to liquidation. The liquidators are investigating the cause of the failures and working to secure and sell the assets. Customers who received incomplete orders have expressed frustration, while affected individuals are urged to submit a Proof of Debt form to register their claims. The company's website remains active, but it is under external administration.","A shed supplier on the Sunshine Coast has become the latest casualty to join a spate of companies in the sector which have gone bankrupt in recent months.
Mooloolaba-based business Transportable Shade Sheds has left dozens of Australians out-of-pocket and have failed to pay their workersâ leave entitlements after going into liquidation on April 3.
The failed company is now under external administration and owes more than $1.3 million to about 160 trade suppliers and creditors.
Bill Cotter of Robson Cotter Insolvency Group was appointed liquidator of the company following its collapse.
There are an additional five other companies set up as a group of related entities which have also ceased trading including Vanquish Holdings Pty Ltd, Bend Tube Designs Pty Ltd, Sable Labour Hire Pty Ltd, Tochlo Pty Ltd and TSS Dealers Pty Ltd. 
âThe businesses had ceased to trade shortly prior to the date of liquidation,â a statement from the liquidators read on its website. 
âThe Liquidator will not be trading-on the business operations of the companies during the liquidation process.â
An investigation into the cause of the companies failures is now underway, with the insolvency group currently âsecuring and realisingâ the assets.
Robson Cotter from the independent boutique advisory firm told the Courier Mail there were dozens of customers who had received partial or fully incomplete orders at the time the company went broke.
âThe amount potentially owing to customers with partially or fully incomplete orders delivered is currently unquantified,â he said.
Mr Cotter added several staff from the company were owed money for leave entitlements and superannuation.
Robert Salomon is understood to be the company director of Transportable Shade Sheds which was founded just over two decades ago in 2002.
Mr Salomon built the ânationally recognised company with international aspirationsâ alongside his partner Kylie, which offered a number of easy installation sheds, quickshades and canvacons.
âWe supply our Shade Sheds as a pre-engineered kit that has been designed for anyone to erect. So, no welding or technical knowledge is required,â the company explained on its website.
âWe swage the frames for you and with our slip fit connection system, it is just a matter of simply joining them together!â
The companyâs website remains active despite its insolvency with customers still able to make inquiries to order products.
As for its social media pages, there were little signs to show the company was struggling, with the last post made to the Transportable Shade Sheds (TSS) Instagram and Facebook accounts asking customers to send a picture of their installed purchase.
âHappy Friday! Check out this awesome shot from one of our customers! Have you got any photos of Your Shade Shed? Weâd love to see them,â the post is captioned.
âWe hope you all have a nice weekend!â
Customers who have been impacted by the companyâs closure have resorted to a Facebook group to vent their frustrations about the lack of notice they were given to suggest the company had gone bust. 
One loyal customer who has purchased seven sheds from the company said she ordered two sheds in June last year and paid the deposit only to never receive the products.
âIâm devastated, angry and canât wait for karma and the legal system to catch up with them so they can pay with what they have done to us and other families, including staff,â she wrote.
âThey chased us in the last two weeks for the balance of $15,000 and we refused to pay till the sheds were delivered to our premises in good order first. 
âIâm so glad we never paid them the extra money and now we have to see how we get our deposit back as we worked extremely hard for the money just like everyone else that got scammed by TSS.â 
Meanwhile one Victorian customer was left with the framework and anchors of a shed after he failed to receive its panels.
âI was told when the original framework was out for shipping, that the suppliers of the panels (are) state specific. Wondering if they are laying at a factory or depot somewhere in Victoria,â he said. 
âI really feel for those who have spent the money with zero to show for.â
A third person who claims they were a dealer and reseller for the company said he now has to find $90,000 to refund customer deposits for sheds âthey are not going to getâ. 
âItâs going to put me close to the edge, but I should hopefully just be able to keep my head above water after I have refunded my customers,â he said.
âAt least my customers will get every cent back whereas there must be hundreds, if not thousands of people around Australia that bought directly through them and will not get a penny back, I feel for them.â
The insolvency group recommends affected customers and creditors to submit a Proof of Debt form to register their claim via its email â admin@rcinsol.com.au.

12,"Stephanie Broadbridge, a stand-up comedian, experienced a surge of online harassment after a viral video featuring her participating in a ""try not to laugh"" challenge gained millions of views. Negative and sexist comments flooded the video, with people criticizing her for not laughing at a joke. The online abuse escalated, spreading to her other comedy clips and impacting her live shows. Broadbridge highlights the gendered and threatening nature of the attacks and emphasizes the need for a safe online environment, especially for professionals who rely on social media promotion. She calls for a shift in societal acceptance of online trolling as an inevitable consequence.","COMMENT
It was a Sunday morning, Iâm a stand-up comedian and I was booked for an unusual gig. I would be sitting opposite a male comedian as we read dad jokes from the internet to each other and tried not to laugh. If we did laugh, we had to take a shot of vodka. 
It was early in the morning and Iâm allergic to alcohol so I was pretty motivated to win the challenge. 
I won 10-1. 
The challenge was filmed and turned into short clips for the relatively small Aussie TikTok account YeahMadTV. I was paid $200 and I assumed the video content would disappear into social media land like the billions of other comedy videos that no one ever sees. But thatâs not what happened. 
The clips went viral. One clip currently has over 47 million views and counting. 
Best dog joke ever written. #dadjokes#dadjokesoftheday#dadjoke#jokes#fyp#dadjokesoftiktok
The joke? What do you call a dog that can do magic? A Labra-cadabrador.
Why was it so popular? Because people hated me and left vicious, sexist comments to let me know exactly how much. The more they commented, the more views the video received. 
When the clip was posted, the important information that I was a performer in a âtry not to laugh challengeâ wasnât included. Instead, it was captioned âBest dog joke ever writtenâ so when I didnât laugh at the joke, I just looked mean.
The commentary seemed to be that how dare I, a woman, not laugh at the funny manâs joke (not his joke, a joke off the internet). I must be a Karen, a feminist, a cat lady, a [redacted] who doesnât have a sense of humour. The few people in the comments who tried to stick up for me by explaining it was a challenge, were also attacked.
I contacted YeahMadTV and they removed some of the nastiest comments and put in the comments that it was the âtry not to laughâ challenge but it didnât stop there. The video developed a life of its own. 
One anonymous account reposted the clip on 9gag, a social media platform that allows users to upload and share content from other social media sites. It was shared under the caption âShe has no sense of Humourâ. The thousands of comments on 9gag, that I canât delete, are so disgusting that I couldnât get through them.
Once I realised YeahMadTV had tagged me, I untagged myself immediately but the trolls still found me.
They wrote negative comments on every stand-up comedy clip I had on TikTok and Instagram. 
I was running ads for my live stand up shows at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and those ads all had to be removed because of the trolling. 
It is very hard to be funny when every time I tell a joke on stage, I can picture these vile comments screaming at me from the audience.
On the final night of my Melbourne Comedy Festival run I broke down. I left the stage ten minutes into my show and burst into tears. I have been performing comedy almost every single night for seven years and this has never happened to me before. I am professional and reliable. I donât cancel. I built my reputation on being âthe chick that doesnât cancelâ.
Yes, of course, men get negative comments online too, but this was different. The language was gendered. It was violent. It was threatening. The attacks were intended to silence me, intimidate me and humiliate me, because I had committed a mortal sin of womanhood, not laughing at a manâs crappy joke. I know Iâm the least objective person in this situation but itâs hard to deny the lashings of misogyny. 
Sure, I could delete social media. If I stop putting myself out there, then people will stop trolling me. But I am a stand-up comedian. This is my job. Part of that job is promoting myself online and I deserve to feel safe at work. 
Itâs not just the arts where a strong social media presence is a requirement. Social media is an integral part of most careers. Nearly every employer checks you out online before hiring you, so to say âjust ignore itâ is completely unreasonable.
Thatâs asking me to ignore the cheapest and most efficient way to promote myself. âDonât worry about itâ or âdonât post things if you donât want to get attackedâ does not resolve the issue. I am worried about it. Itâs disgusting, itâs sexist and itâs ruining my career.
Given social media is an important part of our work life and women are trolled more than men how is that workplace equality? Why are we accepting trolling as a consequence of being online?
The number of women in comedy I have spoken to that have received similar treatment online is truly horrifying. Some have quit comedy, some have been seeking mental health treatment ever since, some just put up with it as part of the deal.
I donât have a solution, but I would suggest that next time you are tempted to write a mean comment on a random clip for no other reason except that youâre bored, maybe donât.

13,"A former Chinese diplomat, Victor Gao, has criticized Australia's ban on TikTok on government devices, calling it ""racism"" and warning against antagonizing a country with 1.4 billion people. The Australian government implemented the ban due to security concerns and fears that the Chinese-owned social media platform could be used for espionage. Gao argued that Australia should have confidence in its own systems and not view TikTok as a threat. However, cybersecurity experts have highlighted the extensive data collection capabilities of the app. The ban on TikTok has been enforced in several other countries, further straining the relationship between Australia and China.","A former Chinese diplomat has labelled Australiaâs TikTok ban on government devices âracismâ, telling the Government: âYou do not want to have an enemy with 1.4 billion people.â
In an interview with 60 Minutes, former diplomat and CCP mouthpiece Victor Gao said of the ban: âProbably itâs racism, probably itâs racial discrimination, probably itâs banning Chinese again, which was a disaster many years ago.
âNow you want to do that again? It will not be a success.â
The Australian Government banned the Chinese-owned social media platform from all government devices, citing fears over security. It follows similar bans in many other countries around the world.
âThis has been informed by security agenciesâ advice on work thatâs been done and provided to the government, so thatâs the decision weâve taken is around government-issued devices,â Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said earlier this month.
Concerns over the scope of personal information that TikTok harvests and its parent company ByteDanceâs apparent links to the communist regime has led governments around the world to believe that China could be weaponising the social media app to spy on their citizens.
Cybersecurity expert Robert Potter previously told 60 Minutes that the app collects a lot more data than other social media sites.
âIt can collect your keystroke patterns, body language, face and body features. It can access photos or passwords that are stored in your phone over time,â he said.
âThereâs a super location field that allows them to collect which direction youâre facing, how fast youâre moving, how high off the ground you are, your latitude and longitude.â
However Mr Gao said Australia shouldnât feel threatened by the app.
âAustralians need to be really confident about their own system, rather than being threatened by TikTok. Banning it is not a sign of strength. Itâs not a sign of superiority, itâs not a sign of confidence. Itâs just the opposite,â he said.
He also said the ban could cause further tensions in Australiaâs already strained relationship with China.
âI would urge the Australian Government to really treat China as an equal, because you do not want to have an enemy with 1.4 billion people,â he said.
Meanwhile, TikTok Australia and New Zealand general manager Lee Hunter insists the ban is politically motivated, saying there was âno evidenceâ to support that peopleâs data was at risk.
He also told 60 Minutes TikTok Australia will not hand over personal information to the CCP.
âWe need to be careful about how we work with China, but at the end of the day TikTok is not China. Weâre an entertainment platform. Weâre about giving people interesting videos in their day,â he said.
All the countries that have total or partial bans on TikTok:
Australia isnât alone in its ban of TikTok from government devices. Many countries around the world have taken similar measures.
Australia: TikTok banned from all federal government-owned devices.
New Zealand: On March 17, New Zealand announced TikTok would be banned from the phones of government politicians at the end of the month. But it only applies to about 500 people in the parliamentary complex.
Estonia: At the end of March, Estoniaâs outgoing minister of IT and foreign trade, Kristjan JÃ¤rvan, said TikTok would be banned from smartphones issued by the state to public officials.
UK: On March 16, an immediate ban was announced of the app on government official devices.
EU governing bodies: The European Parliament, European Commission, and the EU Council have all banned TikTok on staff devices, citing cybersecurity concerns.
France: On March 24, the French government banned the installation and use of ârecreationalâ applications such as TikTok, Netflix and Instagram on the work phones of 2.5 million civil servants.
Netherlands: The government discourages the use of all apps from âcountries with an aggressive cyber-programâ on phones distributed by the government. TikTok wasnât mentioned by name.
Norway: On March 23, the Norwegian parliament banned TikTok from devices issued to government employees.
Belgium: On March 10, Belgium announced it was banning TikTok from devices owned or paid for by Belgiumâs federal government for at least six months.
Denmark: On March 6, Denmarkâs Defence Ministry announced it would âban the use of the app on official unitsâ as a cybersecurity measure.
USA: Government agencies were given until the end of March to delete TikTok from federal devices and systems. However some US politicians have been advocating an outright ban. However, a bid to ban TikTok from operating in the United States altogether was blocked in the senate on March 30. Now, though, Montana has passed a bill to ban TikTok outright from the state. If signed into law, it could come into effect from January 2024.
Canada: The country announced on February 28 it was banning TikTok from all government-issued devices.
India: In 2020, India imposed a ban on TikTok and some other Chinese apps, shortly after a clash between Indian and Chinese troops at a disputed Himalayan border.
Taiwan: In December 2022, Taiwan imposed a TikTok ban on all government devices.
Pakistan: Pakistani authorities have temporarily banned TikTok at least four times since October 2020, citing concerns that the app promotes immoral content.
Afghanistan: Taliban leaders banned TikTok in 2022 on the grounds of protecting youths from âbeing misledâ.",news.com.au,2023-04-16T13:13:05Z,Chinese diplomat blasts Australian Government ban on TikTok,https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/social/chinese-diplomat-calls-australia-racist-after-government-tiktok-ban/news-story/879788d1f90f8dcd867829753de1ce4c
14,"Australia is planning to implement strict reforms on vaping, including banning the importation of most vapes, introducing plain packaging, and removing them from convenience store shelves. The move is a response to concerns about vaping becoming a behavioral crisis in schools and the growing black market. The changes will also involve increasing quality standards, restricting flavors and ingredients, reducing nicotine concentrations, and banning disposable vapes. Health experts believe that vaping poses a public health crisis, with children who vape being three times more likely to take up smoking. The government aims to address the issue through comprehensive regulations and enforcement.","Australia is set to ban the importation of most vapes, introduce plain packaging and strip them from convenience store shelves under world-first reforms.
The biggest crackdown on e-cigarettes in Australian history is set to be unveiled in the May budget amid fears vaping has emerged as a serious behavioural crisis in schools across the nation.
Under current laws vapes with nicotine can only be bought with a prescription from a chemist. 
But that hasnât stopped thousands of convenience stores and online providers selling to kids.
Health Minister Mark Butler will unveil the changes on Tuesday under a crackdown that will also involve the states and territories moving to stamp out the growing black market in illegal vaping.
The changes will include tough new laws to:
- Stop the import of non-prescription vapes
- Increase the minimum quality standards for vapes including by restricting flavours, colours, and other ingredients;
- Require pharmaceutical-like packaging;
- Reduce the allowed nicotine concentrations and volumes; and
- Ban all single use, disposable vapes.
But the reforms wonât stop there, with the Albanese Government preparing to work with states and territories to close down the sale of vapes in retail settings, ending vape sales in convenience stores and other retail settings.
Health experts fear the rise of vapes poses a public health crisis with children who vape three times as likely to take up smoking.
Experts claim thousands of children can no longer sit still in class because they are addicted to vaping after smoking âbubblegumâ flavours that secretly contain nicotine.
Health Minister Mark Butler said it was clear that governments had to act.
âVaping was sold to governments and communities around the world as a therapeutic product to help long-term smokers quit,ââ he said.
âIt was not sold as a recreational product - especially not one for our kids. But that is what it has become: the biggest loophole in Australian history.
âOne in six teenagers aged 14-17 has vaped. One in four people aged 18-24 has vaped. By contrast, only one in 70 people my age has vaped.
âAnd when more than a thousand teenagers aged 15 to 17 were asked where they could get vapes, four out of five of them said they found it easy or somewhat easy to buy them in retail stores.
âThis is a product targeted at our kids, sold alongside lollies and chocolate bars.â
Mr Butler said schools were now struggling to deal with the fallout.
âVaping has become the number one behavioural issue in high schools. And itâs becoming widespread in primary schools,â he said.
âOver the past 12 months, Victoriaâs poisons hotline has taken 50 calls about children under 4 becoming sick from ingesting or using a vape.
âUnder the age of 4! Vapes contain 200 toxic chemicals that do not belong in the lungs, the same chemicals youâll find in nail polish remover and weed killer.
âJust like they did with smoking, Big Tobacco has taken another addictive product, wrapped it in shiny packaging and added flavours to create a new generation of nicotine addicts.
 âVapers are three times as likely to take up smoking, which explains why under 25s are the only cohort in the community currently recording an increase in smoking rates.
âThis must end.â
Vape police could be rolled out to monitor the sale of e-cigarettes to children across Australia including on TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram under a plan that will ban most imports and introduce plain packaging.
VicHealth CEO Sandro Demaio, a globally-renowned public health expert and medical doctor, told news.com.au that as soon as the Albanese Government introduced new import bans enforcement could be much tougher at a state level.
âIn many ways this explosion of vaping has really come out of nowhere over just a couple of years,ââ he said.
âBut the reverse is also possible if we ban the advertising of vapes and actually clamp down on the use of social media to promote these products.
âIf we make them less alluring, so they donât they donât come in Froot Loops flavour and look like a highlighter. They donât have unicorns on the side. That will make them far less appealing.
âAnd basically cut off the tap at the border. Those things will absolutely make a huge difference.â
Dr Demaio said that introducing plain packaging was important because that would then allow enforcement to swing into action.
âObviously, we want to close the access and the huge amount of vapes that have been finding their way into the hands of particularly young people,ââ he said.
âSo what needs to happen at the state level is that there needs to be a licensing scheme in every state.
âThe licences themselves would create revenue, which can support enforcement officers, so weâre not relying on police to enforce the measures that we currently have.
âIn theory, theyâre not currently subject to the laws because they donât contain nicotine. But the vast majority do contain nicotine; theyâre just simply not putting in all the packets.
âAnd really, what needs to be done is to say, âWell, if thereâs no flavours, no colours and the only pathway through a prescription, and they, they, they have pharmaceutical packaging, it then makes it much easier for the states to actually enforce it.â
He warned children were being âviciouslyâ exploited.
âWell, whatâs happened over the last few years is that the tobacco industry and the e-cigarette industry, of which thereâs huge overlap, has seen an opportunity to, you know, get another entire generation of Australians addicted to nicotine with a new product. Thatâs flown under the radar,ââ he said.
âThis industry has used young peopleâs social media. These things are all over social media. You can jump on Tik Tok and there are ads for E cigarettes with a âBuy Nowâ button.
âSocial media is under-regulated in this country. They have flooded the market with really cheap imports from overseas that donât declare that they contain nicotine.
âAnd itâs been a combination of social media, weaponising their data on social media and flooding the market with really cheap and highly addictive imports.â",news.com.au,2023-05-01T13:32:48Z,Australian Government announces crackdown on illegal black market vapes,https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/australian-government-announces-crackdown-on-illegal-black-market-vapes/news-story/9771ff97a465a95b49945da68b61fb00
0,"Conservative MP Alicia Kearns criticized Liz Truss, the former prime minister, for her planned trip to Taiwan, calling it ""Instagram diplomacy"" and a vanity project. Truss intends to show solidarity with Taiwan amid tensions with Beijing, but Kearns believes the trip lacks substance and could worsen the situation for the Taiwanese people. Truss's visit may disrupt the UK government's balanced approach to China, as Foreign Secretary James Cleverly emphasizes avoiding a complete breakdown in relations. Truss's spokesperson defended the trip, stating that the Taiwanese government invited her, and Kearns should apologize for engaging in political attacks.","The Conservative chair of the foreign affairs select committee has launched a blistering attack on Liz Truss over the former prime ministerâs planned trip to Taiwan, calling it âthe worst kind of Instagram diplomacyâ. Alicia Kearns said she thought Trussâs trip planned for next week was little more than a vanity project aimed at keeping her profile high after her brief spell as prime minister last year. Truss is planning to travel to show âsolidarityâ with the Taiwanese people amid aggression from Beijing. Taiwan is a self-governing democracy, but Beijing regards it as a renegade province which must be reunited with the mainland. Trussâs trip has the potential to upset the British governmentâs carefully balanced approach to Chinese relations, with the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, arguing the UK should not âpull the shutters down on Chinaâ. Kearns said: âThe trip is performative, not substantive. It is the worst kind of example of Instagram diplomacy.â She added that the trip was likely to make life harder for the Taiwanese people, who already have to live with a higher level of Chinese military action on their doorstep after the visit by Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the US House of Representatives. Beijing responded to that visit by dispatching warships and military jets to surround the island and firing missiles over it. âIt is deeply unhelpful because it escalates the normal situation in Taiwan,â Kearns said. âTaiwanese people already have to live with more Chinese military manoeuvres because of Nancy Pelosiâs visit. Liz Truss doesnât have any influence any more â this is more about keeping herself relevant.â A spokesperson for Truss hit back saying: âThe former prime minister has been invited to visit by the Taiwan government. They are better placed to know what is in the interests of the Taiwanese people than the MP for Rutland. âThe future of Taiwan as a free democracy is at stake. Alicia Kearns should apologise for misusing her position as a select committee chair to engage in petty political attacks.â Truss announced on Tuesday she planned to visit the island, calling it a âbeacon of freedom and democracyâ.

1,"Annie McAdams, a personal injury lawyer from Houston, Texas, has filed a civil action suit against Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, on behalf of a client who suffered years of sexual exploitation. The lawsuit alleges that Meta knowingly created an environment conducive to human trafficking, facilitating the buying and selling of people for sex on Instagram. The plaintiff claims she was contacted by a man on Instagram who later sold her to multiple sex buyers through the platform. Despite Meta's attempts to dismiss the case, the lawsuit may proceed, potentially setting a significant precedent regarding social media companies' liability. Meta denies the allegations and emphasizes its efforts to combat sex trafficking.","On 14 March 2022, Annie McAdams, a personal injury lawyer running a small firm in Houston, Texas, filed a civil action suit on behalf of one of her clients. The plaintiff was a 23-year-old woman, who had endured years of sexual exploitation at the hands of a convicted trafficker. The defendant was one of the most powerful technology companies in the world. Contained within McAdamsâs federal suit was a series of allegations that Meta â the owner of Facebook and Instagram, which are used by more than 3 billion people every day â had knowingly created a breeding ground for human trafficking and was actively facilitating the buying and selling of people for sex online. The lawsuit alleges that the companyâs products â particularly Instagram â connects vulnerable victims with human traffickers and sex buyers, and provides traffickers with the means to groom those victims. It says that human trafficking victims are regularly posted on Instagram and sold for sex against their will and claims that the company has failed to take adequate steps to stop this. In the court documents, the plaintiff â who we are calling Shawna â says she was 18 when she was first contacted on Instagram by a man she didnât know. She claims that the man â referred to as RL in the court papers â sent her messages on her public profile and on Instagramâs direct-messaging service and that this campaign of grooming led to her agreeing to meet him in person. Two days after their first meeting, she claims that RL began to sell her to sex buyers on Instagram. She claims that RL posted explicit pictures of her on Instagram along with emojis such as dollar signs, crowns and roses, widely recognised by law enforcement and trafficking experts as indicators of commercial sex adverts. â[Meta Inc] knew that the use of these codes were blatant red flags â¦ and were actually sex trafficking advertisements designed to sell her for sex, but [Meta] did nothing to remove or prevent those repeated posts, despite having the ability to do so,â the court papers say. Shawna alleges that over the course of a year she was sold on Instagram to multiple sex buyers. She says she was threatened with homelessness or violence by RL if she refused to fulfil her âquotaâ of sex acts. She went on to testify against RL in a federal criminal trial in Texas and he was subsequently sentenced to 40 years for sex trafficking. However, the lawsuit claims that at the time it was filed to the court in Houston, Instagram had not removed the traffickerâs Instagram account. McAdams claims that despite repeated attempts by Meta to get the case dismissed, Shawna, who is seeking damages from the company, is now on the brink of taking her civil claim against Meta further through the US court system than any other case has managed. She believes that there are now no serious legal obstacles between her case and bringing Meta before a jury in 2024 to face allegations that it played an integral role in the trafficking of her client. A spokesperson for Meta said that Meta prohibits sex trafficking on its platforms âin no uncertain terms â¦ we vigorously deny the claims made against Meta in this suit.â It is not the first time that Meta â in either of its guises as Meta Platforms Inc or Facebook Inc â has faced lawsuits containing similar allegations. Yet in the two decades since it was launched by Mark Zuckerberg from a Harvard dorm, his company â which rebranded from Facebook to Meta in 2021 â like other technology companies with servers based in the US, has never faced prosecution for illegal and harmful content and activities on its platforms. For decades, social media companies have sheltered behind an obscure clause in the 1996 Communications Decency Act â called section 230, which concludes that technology companies are not legally responsible for crimes that occur on their platforms. Section 230 states that providers of âinteractive computer servicesâ â which includes the owners of social media platforms and website hosts â should not be treated as the publisher of material posted by users. Since the act was passed, tech companies such as Meta have argued successfully in US courts that section 230 provides them with immunity from prosecution for any illegal content published on their platforms, as long as they are unaware of that contentâs existence, building a fortress of legal precedent. Section 230 does not shield online platforms from federal criminal charges if they are seen as responsible for facilitating trafficking. And a recent amendment to section 230 â known as the Fosta-Sesta package â means that companies can be held liable under state and civil laws but must be shown to have knowingly assisted or facilitated sex trafficking. Other cases have attempted to swerve section 230, but in her federal suit, McAdams is instead tackling it head-on, arguing that it has been misunderstood and was never intended to protect a social media company which, she claims, knowingly allows crimes against children to occur on its platforms. âThe problem is not section 230,â McAdams says. âThe problem is 20 years of bad precedent and the courtâs misinterpretation of 230. In no place does it say that there should be immunity. There is a big difference between immunity and no liability.â McAdamsâ decision to tackle the interpretation of liability under section 230 comes as changing legal winds across the US challenge the lack of accountability granted to tech companies. The debate around section 230 has become highly polarised. Those who want the clause amended say that the legal safe haven it has provided for internet companies means they have no incentive to root out illegal content on their sites. Others warn that amending section 230 would curb free speech and dismantle democratic values online. Some sex worker groups also warn that undermining section 230 would harm their business and make them unsafe. McAdams says that the only way to stop social media platforms being used as online marketplaces for sex trafficking is through the courts. Along with Shawnaâs case, McAdams has several similar suits filed against Meta across the US in which other plaintiffs allege that Meta enabled, facilitated and profited from their sex trafficking. âAfter years of being silenced, I hope my clients will have their day in court,â she says. âTheir bravery and resilience has started something that could finally see the internet become a safer place for children and open the door for other survivors to be heard. I have many, many more victims waiting to have their cases reviewed. This is just the start.â A Meta spokesperson said: âSex trafficking is abhorrent â¦ we cooperate with law enforcement so they can find and prosecute the criminals who commit these heinous acts, and we use technology to help keep this abuse off our platforms.â âOur goal is to prevent people who seek to exploit others from using our platform, and we work closely with anti-trafficking experts and safety organisations around the world to inform these efforts. We will continue to join with others across society in the fight against sex trafficking and the predators who engage in it.â",Guardian,10/05/2023,The lawyer whose sex trafficking case against Instagram could spell trouble for big tech,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/may/10/lawyer-sex-trafficking-case-against-instagram-could-spell-trouble-for-big-tech

Reece was super-engaging on everything from sustainability to his love of pretentious theatre. Most awkward moment? Very few â conversation flowed naturally. And the overlap of certain âacquaintancesâ on Instagram raised a few eyebrows and laughs. Good table manners? Excellent, although waiting to mention his dairy intolerance until I was tucking into a chocolate fondant wasnât great timing. Best thing about Reece? His confidence and charisma. Would you introduce Reece to your friends? Absolutely. Theyâd get on well. He could have a conversation with anyone. Describe Reece in three words Charming, cheeky, charismatic. What do you think Reece made of you? I wouldnât like to presume â hopefully he thought I wasnât too awful. Did you go on somewhere? As we were in Soho, we went on for a bottle of wine (or twoâ¦) at a queer bar. Andâ¦ â¦ did you kiss? A real lady never kisses on date one.

3,,"Maya Jones* was only 13 when she first walked through the door of Courtneyâs House, a drop-in centre for victims of child sex trafficking in Washington DC. âShe was so young, but she was already so broken by what sheâd been through,â says Tina Frundt, the founder of Courtneyâs House. Frundt, one of Washington DCâs most prominent specialists in countering child trafficking, has worked with hundreds of young people who have suffered terrible exploitation at the hands of adults, but when Maya eventually opened up about what she had been through, Frundt was shaken. Maya told Frundt that when she was 12, she had started receiving direct messages on Instagram from a man she didnât know. She said the man, who was 28, told her she was really pretty. According to Frundt, Maya told her that after she started chatting with the man, he asked her to send him naked photos. She told Frundt that he said he would pay her $40 for each one. He seemed kind and he kept giving Maya compliments, which made her feel special. She decided to meet him in person. Then came his next request: âCan you help me make some money?â According to Frundt, Maya explained that the man asked her to pose naked for photos, and to give him her Instagram password so that he could upload the photos to her profile. Frundt says Maya told her that the man, who was now calling himself a pimp, was using her Instagram profile to advertise her for sex. Before long, sex buyers started sending direct messages to her account, wanting to make a date. Maya told Frundt that she had watched, frozen, what was taking place on her account, as the pimp negotiated prices and logistics for meetings in motels around DC. She didnât know how to say no to this adult who had been so nice to her. Maya told Frundt that she hated having sex with these strangers but wanted to keep the pimp happy. One morning three months after she first met the man, Frundt says that Maya was found by a passerby lying crumpled on a street in south-east DC, half-naked and confused. The night before, Maya told her, a sex buyer had taken her somewhere against her will, and she later recalled being gang-raped there for hours before being dumped on the street. âShe was traumatised, and blamed herself for what happened. I had to work with her a lot to help her realise this was not her fault,â said Frundt when we visited Courtneyâs House last summer. Frundt, who has helped hundreds of children like Maya since she opened Courtneyâs House in 2008, says that the first thing she now does when a young person is referred to her is to ask for their Instagram handle. Other social media platforms are also used to exploit the young people in her care, but she says Instagram is the one that comes up most often. In the 20 years since the birth of social media, child sexual exploitation has become one of the biggest challenges facing tech companies. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the internet is used by human traffickers as âdigital hunting fieldsâ, allowing them access to both customers and potential victims, with children being targeted by traffickers on social media platforms. The biggest of these, Facebook, is owned by Meta, the tech giant whose platforms, which also include Instagram, are used by more than 3 billion people worldwide. In 2020, according to a report by US-based not-for-profit the Human Trafficking Institute, Facebook was the platform most used to groom and recruit children by sex traffickers (65%), based on an analysis of 105 federal child sex trafficking cases that year. The HTI analysis ranked Instagram second most prevalent, with Snapchat third. Grooming and child sex trafficking, though often researched and discussed together, are distinct acts. âGroomingâ refers to the period of manipulation of a victim prior to their exploitation for sex or for other purposes. âChild sex traffickingâ is the sexual exploitation of a child specifically as part of a commercial transaction. When the pimp was flattering and chatting with Maya, he was grooming her; when he was selling her to other adults for sex, he was trafficking. Though people often think of âtraffickingâ as the movement of victims across or within borders, under international law the term refers to the use of force, fraud or coercion to obtain labour, or in the buying and selling of non-consensual sex acts, whether or not travel is involved. Because, under international law, children cannot legally consent to any kind of sex act, anyone who profits from or pays for a sex act from a child â including profiting from or paying for photographs depicting sexual exploitation â is considered a human trafficker. Meta has numerous policies in place to try to prevent sex trafficking on its platforms. âItâs very important to me that everything we build is safe and good for kids,â Mark Zuckerberg, Metaâs founder, wrote in a memo to staff in 2021. In a statement responding to a detailed list of the allegations in this piece, a Meta spokesperson said: âThe exploitation of children is a horrific crime â we donât allow it and we work aggressively to fight it on and off our platforms. We proactively aid law enforcement in arresting and prosecuting the criminals who perpetrate these grotesque offences. When we are made aware that a victim is in harmâs way, and we have data that could help save a life, we process an emergency request immediately.â The statement cited the group director of intelligence at the charity Stop the Traffik, who is former deputy director of the UKâs Serious Organised Crime Agency, who has said âmillions are safer and traffickers are increasingly frustratedâ because of their work with Meta. But over the past two years, through interviews, survivor testimonies, US court documents and human trafficking reporting data, we have heard repeated claims that Facebook and Instagram have become major sales platforms for child trafficking. We have interviewed more than 70 sources, including survivors and their relatives, prosecutors, child protection professionals and content moderators across the US in order to understand how sex traffickers are using Facebook and Instagram, and why Meta is able to deny legal responsibility for the trafficking that takes place on its platforms. While Meta says it is doing all it can, we have seen evidence that suggests it is failing to report or even detect the full extent of what is happening, and many of those we interviewed said they felt powerless to get the company to act. The survivors * * * Courtneyâs House sits on a quiet residential street on the outskirts of Washington DC. Inside, Frundt and her team have tried to make the modest two-storey house feel like a family home, with comfortable sofas and photos on the mantlepiece. Frundt, who was herself trafficked as a child in the 1980s and 90s, is now one of Washington DCâs most experienced and respected anti-trafficking advocates. Warm and ferociously protective of the children in her care, she is contracted by the cityâs child protection services to identify trafficked children going through the court system, and she regularly attends court hearings for the youth in her care. She also helps train the FBI and local law enforcement sex-trafficking units on how to spot traffickers on online platforms, including Instagram. âWhen I was trafficked long ago I was advertised in the classified sections of freesheet newspapers,â Frundt told us. âNow my youth here are trafficked on Instagram. Itâs exactly the same business model but you just donât have to pay to place an ad.â The children who are referred to Frundt, usually by the police or social services, have been sexually exploited and controlled: by a boyfriend, a pimp, a family member. Some of them are as young as nine. Almost without exception, they have childhoods scarred by sexual abuse, poverty and violence. This makes them perfect targets for sexual predators. âThey are all looking for love and affirmation and a sense that they mean something,â said Frundt. Almost all the young people who come to Courtneyâs House are children of colour. They are, Frundt said, battling stereotypes that pressure them to become sexualised too early and make them vulnerable to traffickers. A 2017 study by the Georgetown Law Center on Poverty and Inequality found that adults typically regard Black girls as less innocent and more knowledgable about sex than their white peers. The same study showed that Black girls are often perceived to be older than they are. Most of the time, Frundt says, the children who come to Courtneyâs House are still being trafficked when they walk through the door. Even in cases where they have escaped their exploiters, she said, explicit videos and photos of them often continue to circulate online. Traffickers will lock victims out of their accounts, preventing them from taking down images posted to their profiles. When we asked Frundt if she could show us examples of young people in her care who she says are currently being trafficked on Instagram, she pulled out her phone and scrolled through post after post of explicit images and videos of girls as young as 14 or 15. Most of the photos and videos seemed to have been taken by someone else. Frundt said that these posts were being used as a way of advertising the girls for potential sex buyers, who would send a direct message to buy explicit content or to arrange a meet up. At one point, our conversation was interrupted by the arrival of five teenage girls. They had come back from school, and they gathered around the kitchen table, chatting and playing music on their phones while Frundt served them casserole. After they had eaten, we asked if we could talk to them about their experiences: had any of them been sexually exploited on social media or had explicit videos or pictures posted of them? They glanced at each other and burst out laughing. Yes, they said, of course. All the time. One girl said she felt that ânobody at Instagram cares, they donât care whatâs posted. They donât care shit about us.â Frundt claims that she is constantly asking Instagram to close accounts and take down exploitative content of kids in her care. âI even have law enforcement calling me up asking, âTina, can you get Instagram to do something?â. If I canât get Instagram to act, what hope is there for anyone else?â When we put these concerns to Meta, a spokesperson said: âWe take all allegations and reports of content involving children extremely seriously and have diligently responded to requests from Courtneyâs House. Our ability to remove content or delete accounts requires sufficient information to determine that the content or user violates our policies.â Frundt says that in 2020 and 2021 she had discussions with Instagram about conducting staff training to help prevent child trafficking on its platforms. She says the training didnât go ahead as, after a long back and forth, on a video call Instagram executives said that they wouldnât pay Frundt her standard fee of $3,000, instead allegedly offering $300. When we put this to Meta, they did not deny it. The court documents and the prosecutors * * * What makes social media platforms so powerful as a tool for traffickers â far more powerful than the back pages of a newspaper in which Frundt was advertised as a teenager â is the way that they make it possible to identify and cultivate relationships with both victims and potential sex buyers. Traffickers can advertise and negotiate deals by using different features of the same platform: sellers sometimes post publicly about the girls they have available, and then switch to private direct messages to discuss prices and locations with buyers. US court documents provide a graphic insight into how these platforms can be used. In one case prosecuted in Arizona in 2019, Mauro Veliz, a 31-year-old who was convicted of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of a child, exchanged messages on Facebook Messenger with Miesha Tolliver, who also received jail time for sex trafficking. Tolliver told Veliz that she had one girl available for sex, and photographs of two more, before saying that the girls were aged 17, 16 and 14. Veliz: âHow much is it for all of them?â Tolliver: âThe 14 [year-old] will cost the most â¦ a couple of hundred for her but [$] 150 for the restâ The 14-year-old, Tolliver told Veliz, was ânew to the sex gameâ. Tolliver: âThe 1 on the right â¦ is 16 with a fat ass ... the other [is] 15 with huge titsâ The court transcripts then state that multiple sexually explicit images of the girls were sent to Veliz. Tolliver: âdo you want me to bring 1 of the girls with me so you guys can fuck?â [ ... ] Veliz: âis your girl nervous? Or have you told her yet?â Tolliver: ââ¦ shes still young and doesnât understand how ppl like itâ Tolliver and Veliz exchanged more messages, arranging for Veliz to meet the girl in a hotel in California two days later. The final message submitted to the court was from Veliz to Tolliver. âWeâre finished sheâs in the restroom,â it said. Luke Goldworm, a former assistant district attorney in Boston, Massachusetts, who has investigated and prosecuted human trafficking cases for years, says that he has encountered numerous exchanges like this one. From 2019 until he left the job in October 2022, he said, his departmentâs caseload of child-trafficking crimes on social media platforms increased by about 30% each year. âWeâre seeing more and more people with significant criminal records move into this area. Itâs incredibly lucrative,â he said. A trafficker can make up to $1,000 a night. Many of the victims he saw were just 11 or 12, he said, and most of them were Black, Latinx or LGBTQI+. According to Goldworm, while his investigations involved every social media platform, Meta platforms were the ones he encountered most often. Six other prosecutors in several different states told us that, in their experience, Facebook and Instagram are being widely used to groom children and traffick children. Five of these prosecutors spoke of their anger over what they felt were Metaâs unnecessary delays in complying with judge-signed warrants and subpoenas needed to gather evidence on sex trafficking cases. âWe get a higher rate of rejected warrants from Facebook than any other electronic service provider,â claimed Gary Ernsdorff, senior deputy prosecuting attorney for King County, Washington state. âWhat I find frustrating is that the exchange can delay rescuing a victim by a month.â Three of these prosecutors described experiences where they say the company would cite technicalities, picking faults with wording and format, and slowing down investigations. In response, the company said that these claims were âfalseâ, adding that between January and June last year, it âprovided data in nearly 88% of requests from the US governmentâ. The responsibility for reporting * * * Meta acknowledges that human traffickers use its platforms, but insists that it is doing everything in its power to stop them. By law, the company is required to report any child sexual abuse imagery shared over its platforms to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC), which receives federal funding to act as a nationwide clearing house for leads about child abuse. Meta is a major funder of NCMEC, and holds a seat on the companyâs board. From January to September 2022, Facebook reported more than 73.3m pieces of content under âchild nudity and physical abuseâ and âchild sexual exploitationâ and Instagram reported 6.1m. âMeta leads the industry in using the most sophisticated technology to detect both known and previously unknown child exploitation content,â said a company spokesperson. Of the 34m pieces of child sexual exploitation content removed from Facebook and Instagram in the final three months of 2022, 98% was detected by Meta itself. But the vast majority of the content that Meta reports falls under child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) â which includes photos and videos of pornographic content â rather than sex trafficking. Unlike with child sexual abuse imagery, there is no legal requirement to report child sex trafficking, so NCMEC must rely on all social media companies to be proactive in searching for and reporting it. This legal inconsistency â the fact that child sexual abuse imagery must be reported, but reporting child sex trafficking is not legally required â is a major problem, says Staca Shehan, vice-president of the analytical services division at NCMEC. âItâs concerning across the board how little trafficking is being reported,â Shehan says. Social media companies âare prioritising whatâs [legally] requiredâ. âI think everyone could do more,â Shehan says. âThe volume of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and volume of trafficking [being reported] is like apples and oranges.â According to Shehan, one further reason for this disparity, beyond the differing legal requirements, is technological. âChild sexual abuse material is that much easier to detect. There are so many technology tools that have been developed that allow for the automated detection of that crime.â A NCMEC spokesperson told us that if social media companies are not reporting child sex trafficking, it allows this crime to thrive online. Reporting trafficking, they emphasised, is crucial for rescuing victims and punishing offenders. Between 2009 and 2019, Meta reported just three cases as suspected child sex trafficking in the US to NCMEC, according to records disclosed in a subpoena request seen by the Guardian. A spokesperson for NCMEC confirmed this figure, but clarified that a number of child trafficking cases during the same time period were reported by Meta under other âincident typesâ, such as child pornography or enticement. âI think one of the things to be aware of is that is that thereâs sort of a singular tag thatâs used for reporting,â Antigone Davis, head of global safety at Meta, emphasised to us in a recent interview. âAnd so just because something isnât tagged as sex trafficking doesnât mean that it isnât being reported.â A Meta spokesperson claimed that over the past decade, the company had reported âtens of thousands of accounts which violated our policies against child sex trafficking and commercial child sexual abuse material to NCMEC.â When we put these claims to NCMEC, it said that it had not received âtens of thousandsâ of reports of child trafficking from Meta, but had received that number related to child abuse imagery. Hany Farid is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley who helped invent the PhotoDNA technology that Meta uses to identify harmful content. He believes Meta, which is currently valued at more than $500bn, could do more to combat child trafficking. It could, for instance, be investing more to develop better tools to âflag suspicious words and phrases on unencrypted parts of the platform â including coded language around grooming,â he said. âThis is, fundamentally, not a technological problem, but one of corporate priorities.â (There is a separate debate about how to handle encryption. Metaâs plans to encrypt direct messages on Facebook Messenger and Instagram has recently drawn criticism from law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and Interpol.) In response to Faridâs claims and further questions from the Guardian, Meta did not specify how much money it has invested in technologies to detect child sex trafficking, but said that it had âfocused on using AI and machine learning on non-private, unencrypted parts of its platforms to identify harmful content and accounts and make it easier for people to report messages to the company so we can take action, including referrals to law enforcementâ. Davis also emphasised that Meta constantly works with partners to improve its anti-trafficking safeguards. For instance, she mentioned that âweâve been able to identify the kinds of searches that people do when theyâre searching for trafficking content, so that when people search for that, we will pop up with information to divert them or to let them know that what theyâre doing is illegal activityâ. These efforts have failed to satisfy some of Metaâs own investors. In March, several pension and investment funds that own Meta stock launched legal action against the company in Delaware over its alleged failure to act on âsystemic evidenceâ that its platforms are facilitating sex trafficking and child sexual exploitation. By offering insufficient explanation of how it is tackling these crimes, the complaint says, the board has failed to protect the interests of the company. Meta has rejected the basis for the lawsuit. âOur goal is to prevent people who seek to exploit others from using our platform,â the company said. The moderators * * * As well as software, Meta uses teams of human moderators to identify cases of child grooming and sex trafficking. Until recently, Anna Walker* worked the night shift in an office of a Meta subcontractor. She would start each shift filled with dread. âWe were just, like, shoved in a dark room to look at the stuff,â she said. Walkerâs job was to review interactions between adults and children on Facebook Messenger and Instagram direct messenger that had been flagged as suspicious by Metaâs AI software. Walker claims she and her team struggled to keep pace with the huge backlog of cases. She says she saw cases of adults grooming children and then making plans to meet them for sex, as well as discussions about payment in exchange for sex. Walkerâs managers would pass on such cases to Meta to decide if action should be taken against the user. In some cases, Walker claims: âMonths would pass and then the automatic bot would send me an email saying it was closing this case, because nobodyâs taken action on it.â She added: âI would cry to my manager about [the children I saw] and how I want to help. But it felt like nobody would pay attention to these horrible things.â We talked to six other moderators who worked for companies that Meta subcontracted between 2016 and 2022. All made similar claims to Walker. Their efforts to flag and escalate possible child trafficking on Meta platforms often went nowhere, they said. âOn one post I reviewed, there was a picture of this girl that looked about 12, wearing the smallest lingerie you could imagine,â said one former moderator. âIt listed prices for different things explicitly, like, a blowjob is this much. It was obvious that it was trafficking,â she told us. She claims that her supervisor later told her no further action had been taken in this case. When we put these claims to Meta, a spokesperson said that moderators such as Walker do not typically get feedback on whether their flagged content has been escalated. They stressed that if a moderator does not hear back about a flagged case, that does not mean no action has been taken. Five of the moderators claimed that it was harder to get cases escalated or content taken down if it was posted on closed Facebook groups or Facebook Messenger. Meta âwould be less stringent about something taking place behind âclosed doorsâ,â claimed one team leader. âWith Messenger, we really couldnât make any moves unless the language and content was really obvious. If it was four guys who trusted each other and it was in a group it could just live on for ever.â Meta said these allegations âappear to be misleading and inaccurateâ and said it uses technology to find child sexualisation content in private Facebook groups and on Messenger. In 2021, former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked internal documents that seem to support the moderatorsâ claims. These documents, which numbered thousands of pages, detailed how the company managed harmful content. In one memo from the Haugen leak, the company states that âMessenger groups with less than 32 people should be treated with a full expectation of privacyâ. Matias Cruz*, who worked as a content moderator from 2018 to 2020, reviewing Spanish-language posts on Facebook, believes that the criteria that Meta was using to recognise trafficking was too narrow to keep up with traffickers, who would constantly switch codewords to avoid detection. According to Cruz, traffickers would say: ââI have this cabra [Spanish for goat] for sale,â and itâd be some really ridiculous price. Sometimes they would just outright say [the price] for a night or two, or âan hourâ.â It was obvious what was going on, said Cruz, but âthe managers would claim it was too vague, so in the end they would just leave it upâ. Cruz and three other moderators we spoke to claimed that in examples like this, where their managers felt there was insufficient evidence to escalate the case, moderators could receive lower accuracy scores, which in turn would affect their performance assessments. âWe would take negative hits on their accuracy scores to try to get some help to these people,â Cruz said. The limits of the law * * * While the law requires Meta to report any child exploitation imagery detected on its platforms, the company is not legally responsible for crimes that occur on its platform, because of a law created almost three decades ago, in the early days of the internet. In 1996, the US Congress passed the Communications Decency Act, which was primarily intended to ensure online pornographic content was regulated. But section 230 of the act states that providers of âinteractive computer servicesâ â which includes the owners of social media platforms and website hosts â should not be treated as the publisher of material posted by users. This section was included in the act to ensure the free flow of information while protecting the growing tech industry from being crushed by litigation. Whereas a newspaper, say, must legally defend what it publishes, section 230 means that a company like Meta, which hosts the content of others, may not be held liable for what appears on its platforms. Section 230 therefore positions internet service providers as fundamentally neutral: offering forums in which illegal, harmful or false content may be posted and circulated, but ultimately not responsible for that content. Since the passing of the act, tech companies such as Meta have argued successfully in courts across the US that section 230 provides them with complete immunity from prosecution for any illegal content published on their platforms, as long as they are unaware of that contentâs existence. The debate around section 230 has become highly polarised. Those who want section 230 amended say that the legal safe harbour it has provided for internet companies means they have no incentive to root out illegal content on their sites. In an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal in January, President Biden spoke out in favour of the sectionâs reform. âIâve long said we must fundamentally reform section 230,â he wrote, calling for âbipartisan action by Congress to hold big tech accountable.â However, tech companies, along with internet freedom groups, argue that changes to section 230 could lead to censorship and an erosion of privacy, particularly for private, encrypted content. These arguments over section 230 are being put to the test in a landmark case that has reached the US supreme court, which focuses on how far YouTube can be considered culpable for the videos it recommends to its users. A ruling is due by the end of June. The consequences * * * Kyle Robinson is one year into serving a 10-year sentence at a federal prison in Massachusetts for sex trafficking two teenagers, one only 14 years old. We spoke to him in January over the muffled line of the prisonâs payphone, our conversation interrupted by prison staff monitoring the call. Referring to himself as a pimp, Robinson described how he sought out damaged girls from care homes and on social media as a way to make money. Instagram, he said, was his platform of choice. âI find the girls that have pride in themselves, but maybe donât have the confidence, the self-esteem,â he claimed. âI make her feel special. I give her validation, social skills, her âhotentialâ, if you know what I mean.â Once he had identified his targets, Robinson claimed that he would âcoachâ them and advertise them on their Instagram accounts and his own. He would talk to potential buyers through direct messages, offering to send video snippets of the girls in return for âa small depositâ â about $20 â so that the buyers could see what they would be getting. If a buyer decided to meet a girl, he would pay her the rest of the money later, via CashApp, he said. Robinson would then take most of that money. To crack down on such cases of child sexual exploitation, last June Meta announced new policies including age verification software that will require users under 18 to provide proof of age through uploading an ID, recording a video selfie, or asking mutual friends on Facebook to confirm their age. When we asked Tina Frundt about these new measures, she was sceptical. The kids she works with had already found workarounds; a 14-year-old, for example, might use a video selfie made by her 18-year-old friend, and pretend that itâs her own. Even after children have been referred to Courtneyâs House, they continue to be vulnerable to traffickers. One night in June 2021, Frundt says she got a call from Maya, telling her she had arrived home safe. Frundt was relieved: she knew that Maya had spent the evening with a 43-year-old man who had been contacting her on Instagram. Frundt says that Maya, now 15, was in a fragile state: over the previous few months, her mental health had been in sharp decline and she had told Frundt sheâd been feeling suicidal. Photos and explicit videos taken by a pimp showing her having sex were being circulated and sold on Instagram. Sex buyers were contacting her relentlessly through her direct messages. âShe didnât know how to make it stop or how to say no,â Frundt recalled. That night, on the phone, Frundt told Maya that she loved her and that they would talk in the morning. âThatâs the last time I ever spoke to her,â said Frundt. The older man had given Maya drugs. When Mayaâs mother went to wake her daughter the next morning, she found her dead. A picture of Maya that still hangs on the wall of Courtneyâs House shows a baby-faced teenage girl with brown curls and a huge smile. Two years after her death, Frundt continues to grieve for her caring âgirly girlâ who loved makeup, board games and dancing to her favourite Megan Thee Stallion songs. âLosing one of our youth, it changes you for ever. You can never forgive yourself,â she said. Before Maya died, Frundt claims she spoke to Instagram on a video call, asking them to remove the exploitative content her trafficker had circulated. Frundt says that when Maya died, the videos of her being exploited were still on the platform. In July 2021, a representative from an anti-trafficking organisation sent an email to Instagramâs head of youth policy, informing her of Mayaâs death. Frundt was copied in on the email. It asked why Metaâs tools designed to detect grooming had not flagged a 43-year-old man contacting a young girl. Four days later, the company sent a brief reply. If Instagram was provided with details about the alleged traffickerâs account, it would investigate. But Frundt says that it was too late. âShe had already passed,â she says. âThey could have done something to help her but they didnât. She was gone.â Names marked with an asterisk have been changed to preserve anonymity. â¢ In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453.

4,"An alliance of global law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, Interpol, and Britain's National Crime Agency, has criticized Meta's plans to encrypt direct messages on Facebook Messenger and Instagram. They argue that encryption would weaken efforts to protect child users. The Virtual Global Taskforce, chaired by the NCA, expressed concerns about the potential harm caused by Meta's design choices. While acknowledging Meta's cooperation with child protection organizations, the alliance fears that encrypting messages could hinder detection and prosecution of online child sexual abuse cases. Meta defended its encryption plans, stating that it has implemented safety measures to combat abuse while maintaining privacy.","An alliance of the worldâs most powerful law enforcement agencies including the FBI, Interpol and Britainâs National Crime Agency (NCA) have condemned Metaâs plans to encrypt direct messages on Facebook Messenger and Instagram, saying that doing so will weaken the ability to keep child users safe. The Virtual Global Taskforce, made up of 15 agencies, is chaired by the NCA and also includes Europol and the Australian federal police among its membership. The VGT has spoken out, it says, owing to the âimpending design choicesâ by Meta, which it says could cause serious harm. The decision to encrypt direct messages on the platforms, which would prevent anyone other than the intended recipient being able to intercept the communications, âis an example of a purposeful design choice that degrades safety systems and weakens the ability to keep child users safeâ, the alliance said. The VGT praised Metaâs work with the American National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which acts as a clearing house for reports on online child sexual abuse. Meta reported more such cases to the NCMEC than any other provider, the alliance said, but it feared that lead would disappear once the messages are âend-to-end encryptedâ (E2EE). âThe VGT has not yet seen any indication from Meta that any new safety systems implemented post-E2EE will effectively match or improve their current detection methods,â it said. Citing the case of David Wilson, who was jailed in 2021 for abusing 52 children, the VGT predicted similar arrests could prove impossible with encryption enabled. âThe successful prosecution of Wilson and the resulting safeguarding of hundreds of children was possible because law enforcement were able to access the evidence contained within over 250,000 messages through Facebook. In an E2EE environment, it is highly unlikely this case would have been detected.â In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said: âThe overwhelming majority of Brits already rely on apps that use encryption. We donât think people want us reading their private messages, so have developed safety measures that prevent, detect and allow us to take action against this heinous abuse, while maintaining online privacy and security. âAs we continue to roll out our end-to-end encryption plans, we remain committed to working with law enforcement and child safety experts to ensure that our platforms are safe for young people. âIn the case of David Wilson, we submitted Cybertips to authorities using both public and private information,â the spokesperson added. âWe have developed detection systems using behavioural signals and other account activity that are not reliant on the content of private messages to identify malicious actors like David Wilson. Itâs misleading and inaccurate to say that encryption would have prevented us from identifying and reporting accounts like David Wilsonâs to the authorities.â Plans to encrypt all messages on Metaâs platforms were first revealed in 2019, when the company was still called Facebook. But they have been delayed a number of times, because of technical hurdles and regulatory pressure. In April 2021, the company announced the integration would not happen until 2022 at the earliest, before pushing the deadline back to 2023 in November 2021. âWeâre taking our time to get this right,â Metaâs head of safety, Antigone Davis, said when the latest delay was announced. âAs a company that connects billions of people around the world and has built industry-leading technology, weâre determined to protect peopleâs private communications and keep people safe online.â But in the years since, Meta has given few details on how the push to encrypt communications by default would avoid harsh trade-offs against its existing child safety practices. Davis said Meta would be able to detect abuse by using non-encrypted data, account information and reports from users. Metaâs third messaging platform, WhatsApp, already uses a similar approach to tackle child sexual abuse but makes far fewer referrals to NCMEC as a result. In March 2022, the non-profit released data showing Facebook made 22m reports of online exploitation of children in 2021, while WhatsApp made just 1.3m. Other encrypted platforms with similar user bases were even worse: Apple, which runs iMessage, reported just 160 cases. VGTâs intervention comes two days after WhatsApp joined forces with other encrypted messaging apps, including its rival Signal, to call on the UK government to protect E2EE in the online safety bill. The services hinted they may be forced to leave the UK, rather than obey the new law, if it attempted to criminalise encryption.",Guardian,20/04/2023,Crime agencies condemn Facebook and Instagram encryption plans,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/20/crime-agencies-condemn-facebook-instagram-encryption-plans
5,"Former US President Donald Trump returned to Instagram after his suspension from major social media platforms following the Capitol attack on 6 January 2021. Trump used his return to promote a second edition of his digital trading cards, which sold out quickly and earned $4.5 million. He also faces legal challenges, including a criminal indictment in New York and investigations into his business affairs. While banned on Twitter, Trump has been using his own platform, Truth Social. Despite these controversies, he remains a frontrunner in Republican presidential nomination polls.","Donald Trump returned to Instagram on Tuesday, posting for the first time since 5 January 2021, the day before the former US president incited the deadly attack on Congress which led to his suspension from major social media platforms. Trump, who is now running to regain the White House, used his return to Instagram to promote a second edition of his digital trading cards, a project widely mocked when he announced it in December but which sold out an edition of 44,000 in less than a day, netting $4.5m. Trump has already enjoyed a fundraising boost this month, centered on his criminal indictment in New York on 34 charges of falsification of business records, all relating to his hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, an adult film star who claims an affair. The parent company of Instagram and Facebook, Meta, lifted its ban on Trump in January. Metaâs president of global affairs, the former British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, said then there would be ânew guardrails in place to deter repeat offensesâ. âIn the event that Mr Trump posts further violating content,â Clegg said, âthe content will be removed and he will be suspended for between one month and two years, depending on the severity of the violation.â On Tuesday, Trumpâs first post back on Instagram announced the second series of cards alongside an image of him holding the Liberty Bell against a sunset and the Stars and Stripes. In his second post, a picture of himself as a superhero in red spandex and wearing the US flag as a cape, Trump wrote: âI hope everyone notices, and Iâm sure the Fake News wonât, that Iâm leaving the price of the Trading Cards the same as last time.â He also claimed he âcould have raised the price MUCH HIGHER, and I believe it still would have sold well, with a lot more money coming to me, but I didnât choose to do so. I WILL BE GIVEN NO âNICE GUYâ CREDIT?â Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter, lifted its Trump ban in November. Trump has not returned, instead using Truth Social, the platform he set up after January 6. As well as the New York indictment, Trump faces legal jeopardy over the events of January 6, his election subversion, his handling of classified material, his business affairs and an allegation of rape. Denying all wrongdoing, he remains the clear leader in polling regarding the Republican nomination for president. Trumpâs last Instagram post before his ban was an announcement of his speech near the White House on 6 January 2021. The House January 6 committee has shown that Trump knew members of the crowd were armed, but still told supporters to march on the Capitol and âfight like hellâ to overturn his election defeat. Mark Bowden and Matt Teague, authors of The Steal: The Attempt to Overturn the 2020 Election and the People Who Stopped It, contend that the rioters âhad no more chance of overthrowing the US government than hippies in 1967 had trying to levitate the Pentagonâ. But nine deaths are now linked to the riot, including law enforcement suicides. Trump was impeached a second time, for inciting an insurrection.

6,"The dahlia flower has experienced a surge in popularity, particularly among inexperienced gardeners drawn to its bold and showy blooms that look great on Instagram. Despite a perception that its reign may be over, dahlias continue to thrive on social media. As summer approaches, it's time to plant dahlia tubers, which originated in Central America and were initially cultivated as a food crop. Nurseries like Halls of Heddon offer ready-to-plant ""mini plants"" and garden-ready dahlias for those seeking a vibrant display. When choosing varieties, consider both color and height, as dahlias can grow quite tall and may require staking.","Thereâs one flower whose relevance in the zeitgeist fascinates me beyond all others: the dahlia. Bold, brash, blooms as big as your head, they can command devotion bordering on obsession among some flower-growers, especially â and intriguingly â among the relatively inexperienced gardener. This is, I think, because they can be straightforward to grow, and look good on Instagram. I suspect in some gardens dahlias have never been out of fashion. However, theyâve certainly enjoyed a prolonged moment over the past decade. A couple of summers ago, though, I chaired a panel with experts Sarah Raven and Arthur Parkinson, who admitted to being a bit fed up with the cream-coloured queen of Pinterest, dahlia âCafÃ© au Laitâ. This, combined with their absence during the one-off September Chelsea flower show a few months later, had me convinced the dahliaâs millennial reign was over. Nevertheless, they persevere on Instagram â and life is too short to grow flowers according to trends. I mention all this because nowâs the time to get cracking if you want flowers this summer (and autumn, and maybe even winter) and havenât bought tubers. Dahlias begin as tubers: funny, potatoey and indeed edible little rhizomes indigenous to Central America, where they were a food crop before European colonists turned up. The Aztec name for them is acocoxochitl, which refers to the stemsâ abilities to carry water. In the UK, those who ordered their dahlias last year will have received them a couple of months ago. More assertive gardeners will have planted them in pots, kept them ever so slightly moist â they are prone to rot â and somewhere warm and bright, such as a greenhouse (or my south-facing front room). Last year, I planted tubers in pots outside in mid-May. They leafed up quickly and, while I didnât have the worldâs greatest display, I did get some flowers. Better, then, at this time of year, to be picking up ones someone else has started off for you. Nurseries such as Halls of Heddon, which has marked its 60th anniversary by going peat-free, will dispatch âmini plantsâ, which can be planted into 12cm pots around now â and garden-ready dahlias from June. The arrival of its catalogue in the depths of December is one of my favourite annual traditions, the combination of old-school graphic design, bright colour and preposterous variety names (âCrazy 4 Donâ, âDeborahâs Kiwiâ) brightening up long nights. If youâre shopping for varieties for the first time, make sure to check the height as much as the colour: dahlias can be big plants that need staking as the season goes on. After a couple of summers of deadheading and preening, Iâm keeping any I grow in pots (âWaltzing Mathildaâ is lovely against autumnal sunlight, âMoonfireâ has chic black stems and âTally Hoâ is imbued with retro charm), where they wonât take up too much space for other perennials.

7,"Advertisements on Instagram and Snapchat for county lines exploitation, targeting children and young people, have evolved to resemble professional job adverts, according to experts testifying before a parliamentary committee. The traffickers constantly change their methods to entrap victims, with social media platforms being urged to take more responsibility. The committee heard that children as young as seven are now involved in drug running, lured by professionally crafted recruitment opportunities. Vulnerability is shifting, and traffickers are increasingly targeting affluent children. The National Crime Agency has identified county lines exploitation as a prevalent form of coerced criminality, primarily affecting children.","County lines adverts on Instagram and Snapchat designed to groom children and young people now resemble professional job adverts, a parliamentary committee heard on Tuesday. Experts from charities gave evidence to Tuesdayâs cross-party education committee about the constantly evolving scene, with traffickers frequently changing their methods of ensnaring children and young people. Johnny Bolderson, manager at the organisation Catch 22, which helps to support and rescue children and young people groomed into county lines exploitation, told the committee that children as young as seven were now getting involved in drug running. He said: âSocial media platforms need to take more responsibility. Adverts on Instagram and Snapchat for young people to get involved in county lines look professionally done â ârecruitment opportunities availableâ. That has been growing in the last six months. Since Covid, families are struggling, and with really professional advertising young people think they are going to help out their families.â The committee heard that London, West Midlands, Manchester and Merseyside were four of the main areas for county lines activity, and that thousands of children and young people were getting pulled in every year. Rebecca Griffiths, head of the National Counter-Trafficking Service at Barnardoâs, said that the charity had received 300 referrals from various parts of England and Wales in the past three months. âVulnerability is changing all the time. We are seeing much younger children and the modus operandi of traffickers is changing. They are targeting more affluent children. Every child can be exploited criminally,â she said. Some girls have been forced to take on âdebtsâ for their boyfriends they are expected to repay. Children can be given free vapes along with bicycles, sweets, magazines or even free sandwiches to entice them to get involved with county lines groomers. Iryna Pona, policy and impact manager at the Childrenâs Society, said: âVaping is a way of grooming.â According to Bolderson, children can also be reeled in through online gaming platforms where groomers befriend them in internet gaming chatrooms, give them coins to enable them to play more games. The children then owe a debt and find themselves in âdebt bondageâ to the groomers. He said children could be groomed without leaving their bedrooms. Susannah Drury, director of policy and development at the charity Missing People, told the committee that it was partly a public health issue, with a cross-government approach required and children benefiting from early intervention. Of the county lines traffickersâ approach, she said: âThis is a business model thatâs very fluid, very reactive, very agile.â The National Crime Agency has called county lines exploitation âthe most frequently identified form of coerced criminality, with children representing the vast majority of victimsâ. The Home Officeâs 2020 Drugs Review by Dame Carol Black found strong associations between young people being drawn into county lines and increases in child poverty, the numbers of children in care and school exclusions.",Guardian,28/02/2023,âProfessional advertsâ for county lines ensnaring children on Instagram and Snapchat ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/28/county-lines-grooming-looks-like-professional-job-ads-on-social-media
8,"Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, is testing subscription models for its social media platforms as it faces pressure on multiple fronts. Advertising has been the primary revenue source for Meta, but challenges such as Apple's privacy changes, regulatory rulings, and a weak advertising environment have prompted the exploration of alternative revenue streams. Meta's subscription service, called Meta Verified, offers features like verified badges, account monitoring, increased visibility, and personal support in exchange for a monthly fee. The service is being tested in Australia and New Zealand and is aimed at creators and influencers.","Mark Zuckerbergâs social media empire is built on billions of users â and the advertisers who pay vast sums to grab their attention. But that business model is under pressure on several fronts. It is against this backdrop that Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said on Sunday it is trialling subscriptions for both social media platforms. âAdvertising has paid for editorial content and other things for centuries,â says Johnny Ryan, a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and a campaigner for stronger protection of internet usersâ data. âI do not see that changing. But the tracking-based ads that snoop on our every move are the historical anomaly, and they are on the way out.â Facebook and Instagram offer a goldmine of user data for advertisers. Facebook alone has 2 billion daily users, while across all of Metaâs platforms including Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger the total is just under 3 billion. Facebook generates revenue from building profiles of those users and matching them with advertisers, who direct ads at people targeting their specific interests and background. This advertising-based model accounted for 98% of Metaâs $116.6bn in revenues last year, but it faces problems. In 2021, Apple introduced privacy changes that required apps sold on the Apple store to ask users permission to track their activity across other apps and the internet â a key means of gathering data for targeted adverts. Of course, many users have opted not to be tracked, and Meta warned that the change would reduce its 2022 ad revenue by $10bn. Regulators loom as well. Last month Metaâs business model was dealt a blow by a ruling that the companyâs legal justification for targeting users with personalised ads broke EU data laws. Meta said the ruling did not prevent targeted or personalised advertising, but it is very clear what the EU, which is a highly influential tech regulator, thinks about Metaâs user data-oriented business model. Then there is general economic weakness, to which any advertising-dependent social media or search company is susceptible. In its most recent quarterly results, Meta reported a 4% drop in revenue while other platforms, including Snap, Google and Elon Muskâs Twitter, have also warned of a weak advertising environment. Musk has launched a revamped Twitter subscription service to offset the company reliance on advertising, although its ad business has also suffered self-inflicted blows. Dan Ives, an analyst at the US financial services firm Wedbush Securities, says launching a subscription service is an obvious response to challenges that have already resulted in Meta announcing plans to cut 11,000 jobs. âMeta is seeing clear headwinds on the digital advertising model and this is a low-hanging-fruit way to potentially pick up some incremental revenue,â he says. Under the Meta Verified offering, users will pay a monthly subscription fee â $14.99 for people using the Facebook or Instagram app on an Apple iPhone or an Android phone, with a lower charge of $11.99 for web access â to enjoy features including: a verified badge on your account, certified by a piece of government ID; a monitoring service to deter account impersonators; increased visibility and reach for your account, such as in search and recommendations; and personal support for problems with your account. It is being tested in Australia and New Zealand and Meta says it hopes to bring the new product to the rest of the world âsoonâ. An obvious market for the service is the creators and influencers who use Metaâs platforms, particularly Instagram. Meta says it will help âup and comingâ creators, adding that âsubscribers with a smaller following may see a more noticeable impact to their reachâ. Kat Molesworth, co-founder of the Creator Union, which hopes to start recruiting members this year, says Meta should not be charging for services she suggests should come as standard: âI would question if itâs appropriate to charge creators, who contribute to Metaâs massive profits, for basic features.â Referring to Google-owned YouTubeâs practice of sharing advertising proceeds with creators, she adds: âYouTube shares revenues pretty much 50/50 with its creators and has done for over a decade. YouTube recognises that without creators it would not have an ad business.â On Sunday, Musk described Metaâs move as âinevitableâ; although whether it is destined to succeed, after nearly two decades of free-access orthodoxy at Zuckerbergâs business, is a different matter.",Guardian,20/02/2023,Does paid-for Facebook and Instagram signal end of free-access orthodoxy?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/20/facebook-instagram-paid-for-signal-free-access-meta

10,"Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, will introduce a paid verification service for users, following Twitter's footsteps. The service, initially rolling out in Australia and New Zealand, will cost $11.99 per month on the web and $14.99 on iOS and Android. Verified users will receive a blue badge, increased visibility, extra protection against impersonation, and customer support. The verification process will require government ID documents and a posting history. The service will not be available to businesses initially. Meta's move comes as it faces declining ad revenue and economic challenges, with a recent workforce reduction of 11,000 employees. In a separate development, Twitter announced it would limit SMS-based two-factor authentication to paid Twitter Blue subscribers, raising concerns about potential security risks for non-subscribers.","Facebook and Instagram users will soon need to pay to be verified on the social media platforms, as Meta follows in the footsteps of rival platform Twitter. Mark Zuckerberg, Metaâs chief executive, announced in a Facebook post on Sunday that the service would first roll out in Australia and New Zealand later this week. The company said it would cost US$11.99 a month on web or US$14.99 on iOS and Android (or, in Australia, $19.99 on web or $24.99 on iOS and Android). Zuckerberg said in addition to a blue badge the service would offer âextra impersonation protectionâ, improved reach for verified users and direct access to customer support. In a blog post, Meta said it would rely on government ID documents to prove the identity of verified accounts, to avoid the embarrassment of accounts impersonating people and brands â as happened when Twitter initially rolled out its paid verification service. Accounts must also have a posting history and users must be at least 18 years old. The service would not be available to businesses at this stage, Meta said. The increased visibility of posts from verified users would âdepend on a subscriberâs existing audience size and the topic of their postsâ, the company said. Those with smaller audiences might see more of an impact. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The company said it would also offer âexclusive stickersâ on Facebook and Instagram stories and Facebook reels. Meta cut 11,000 staff in November â the equivalent of 13% of its workforce â amid falling ad revenue and economic downturn. The companyâs share price fell by more than 70% in 2022 before a rebound and in July it reported its first ever fall in revenue. Twitterâs CEO, Elon Musk, responded to the news in a tweet saying it was âinevitableâ Meta would follow Twitter. Twitter restricts SMS two-factor authentication to paid accounts Separately, Twitter announced on Friday it would provide SMS-based two-factor authentication only to users who are subscribed to the US$8-a-month ($11.65) Twitter Blue service from 20 March. The company currently provides free two-factor authentication through third-party apps and a security key, which are considered more secure than SMS-based systems. If non-subscriber accounts that use SMS authentication do not switch before the deadline, Twitter said it would disable two-factor authentication for that account. The move has sparked concerns that it could lead to widespread hacks on accounts next month if they fail to switch over. Twitterâs last transparency report prior to Muskâs takeover shows that as of December 2021, although just 2.6% of active Twitter accounts use two-factor authentication, 74.4% of those use SMS as their method of authentication. Musk has claimed Twitter was being âscammedâ US$60m a year from fake two-factor authentication messages. He separately supported a tweet claiming the scams were being run by telecommunications companies that had set up bot accounts to run the two-factor authentication process to get revenue from the text messages from Twitter.",Guardian,20/02/2023,Facebook and Instagram to get paid verification as Twitter charges for two-factor SMS authentication,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/20/facebook-instagram-paid-meta-verification-twitter-charge-2fa-two-factor-authentication-via-sms
11,"The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has targeted over 10,000 misleading financial promotions and scams on social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok. The FCA issued a record number of takedown notices and alerts as the use of social media marketing, particularly aimed at younger age groups, surged. Google, Meta, TikTok, Twitter, and Microsoft's Bing adjusted their advertising policies following FCA intervention, but the regulator emphasized the need for more action by tech companies to protect consumers. The FCA employed advanced technology and hired personnel to identify problematic firms and misleading adverts, resulting in the review and takedown of thousands of websites and platforms.","More than 10,000 misleading financial promotions and scams aimed at consumers via social media sites such as Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok have been identified and targeted by the financial watchdog during the past year. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the use of social media marketing channels and the rise of so-called âfin-fluencersâ â particularly directing investment products at younger age groups â exploded last year, resulting in a record number of takedown notices and alerts. The FCA ordered businesses to amend or remove 8,582 promotions during 2022, 15 times the 573 recorded the previous year. It also published almost 1,900 alerts to consumers about potential scammers, up more than a third up on 2021. Google, which owns YouTube, Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, TikTok, Twitter and Microsoftâs Bing have changed advertising policies to ensure that regulated firms are involved in adverts for financial products after FCA intervention. However, the regulator said it was still monitoring whether the companies were effectively blocking illegal adverts. âMore needs to be done by tech companies to protect consumers,â the FCA said. âGiven the substantial number of illegal promotions we continue to identify, our expectation is that every social media platform improves their capability to identify and remove the illegal financial promotions on a proactive basis.â The crackdown included taking action against a company that attempted to take advantage of the cost of living crisis, targeting more than 70,000 online followers that the FCA deemed were potentially vulnerable consumers. An online retail broker with more than 1.1 million UK customers, with a primary market of millennial age investors, was ordered to halt a marketing campaign after the FCA identified âserious concernsâ that its promotions, which used social media influencers, were âtargeting vulnerable customers with significant debtâ. The FCA also sought to get an unregistered cryptocurrency exchange offering products to UK consumers to be shut down, and separately alerted 55 consumers who had been identified on a scammers list targeting consumers who had been searching for loans online. âFinancial promotions must be fair, clear and not misleading,â said Sarah Pritchard, executive director, markets, at the FCA. âThis year, we will continue to put pressure on people using social media to illegally promote investments, which put peopleâs hard-earned money at risk.â The FCA said advances in the technology it uses to identify problem firms and misleading adverts had also fuelled the increase in cases last year. It has hired more than 100 people in roles such as machine learning and data analysis to build automated tools to scan thousands of websites every day. The watchdog said it looked at about 180,000 websites last year, resulting in about 4,500 websites and social media platforms being reviewed. This resulted in 1,441 alerts being issued and 400 of the offending websites being taken down. Last year, the Advertising Standards Authority sent enforcement notices to 50 firms in the cryptocurrency sector warning them that they must clearly explain the risks for potential investors. The watchdog slapped bans on a bitcoin firm for urging that it was âtime to buyâ or miss out, and on football club Arsenalâs campaign to get fans to buy its crypto âtokensâ.",Guardian,3/02/2023,"Scams: FCA blocks more than 10,000 ads from Instagram, Facebook and YouTube",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/feb/03/scams-fca-blocks-more-than-10000-ads-from-instagram-facebook-and-youtube
12,"Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has announced that former US President Donald Trump will be allowed back on the platforms after a two-year ban. However, there will be new ""guardrails"" in place to deter repeat offenses. If Trump violates community standards, his content will be removed and he could face suspensions ranging from one month to two years. The decision, which Meta described as allowing for ""open, public and democratic debate,"" has drawn criticism from civil rights advocates concerned about the potential for misinformation and real-life violence. Trump was banned from several other social media platforms following the Capitol riots in January 2021.","In a highly anticipated decision, Meta has said it will allow Donald Trump back on Facebook and Instagram following a two-year ban from the platforms over his online behavior during the 6 January insurrection. Meta will allow Trump to return âin coming weeksâ but âwith new guardrails in place to deter repeat offensesâ, Metaâs president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, wrote in a blogpost explaining the decision. âLike any other Facebook or Instagram user, Mr Trump is subject to our community standards,â Clegg wrote. âIn the event that Mr Trump posts further violating content, the content will be removed and he will be suspended for between one month and two years, depending on the severity of the violation.â Trump was removed from Meta platforms following the Capitol riots on 6 January 2021, during which he posted unsubstantiated claims that the election had been stolen, praised increasingly violent protesters and condemned former vice-president Mike Pence even as the mob threatened his life. Clegg said the suspension was âan extraordinary decision taken in extraordinary circumstancesâ and that Meta has weighed âwhether there remain such extraordinary circumstances that extending the suspension beyond the original two-year period is justifiedâ. Ultimately, the company has decided that its platforms should be available for âopen, public and democratic debateâ and that users âshould be able to hear from a former President of the United States, and a declared candidate for that office againâ, he wrote. âThe public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying â the good, the bad and the ugly â so that they can make informed choices at the ballot box,â he said. While it is unclear if the former president will begin posting again on the platform, his campaign indicated he had a desire to return in a letter sent to Meta in January. âWe believe that the ban on President Trumpâs account on Facebook has dramatically distorted and inhibited the public discourse,â the letter said. Safety concerns and a politicized debate The move is likely to influence how other social media companies will handle the thorny balance of free speech and content moderation when it comes to world leaders and other newsworthy individuals, a debate made all the more urgent by Trumpâs run for the US presidency once again. Online safety advocates have warned that Trumpâs return will result in an increase of misinformation and real-life violence. Since being removed from Meta-owned platforms, the former president has continued to promote baseless conspiracy theories elsewhere, predominantly on his own network, Truth Social. While widely expected, the decision still drew sharp rebukes from civil rights advocates. âFacebook has policies but they under-enforce them,â said Laura Murphy, an attorney who led a two-year long audit of Facebook concluding in 2020. âI worry about Facebookâs capacity to understand the real world harm that Trump poses: Facebook has been too slow to act.â The Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Free Press and other groups also expressed concern on Wednesday over Facebookâs ability to prevent any future attacks on the democratic process, with Trump still repeating his false claim that he won the 2020 presidential election. âWith the mass murders in Colorado or in Buffalo, you can see there is already a cauldron of extremism that is only intensified if Trump weighs in,â said Angelo Carusone, president and CEO of media watchdog Media Matters for America. âWhen Trump is given a platform, it ratchets up the temperature on a landscape that is already simmering â one that will put us on a path to increased violence.â After the 6 January riots, the former president was also banned from Twitter, Snapchat and YouTube. Some of those platforms have already allowed Trump to return. Twitterâs ban, while initially permanent, was later overruled by its new chief executive, Elon Musk. YouTube has not shared a timeline on a decision to allow Trump to return. Trump remains banned from Snapchat. Meta, however, dragged out its ultimate decision. In 2021, CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained in a post that Trump had been barred from the platforms for encouraging violence and that he would remain suspended until a peaceful transition of power could take place. While Zuckerberg did not initially offer a timeline on the ban, the company punted its decision about whether to remove him permanently to its oversight board: a group of appointed academics and former politicians meant to operate independently of Facebookâs corporate leadership. That group ruled in May 2021 that the penalties should not be âindeterminateâ, but kicked the final ruling on Trumpâs accounts back to Meta, suggesting it decide in six months â two years after the riots. The deadline was initially slated for 7 January, and reports from inside Meta suggested the company was intensely debating the decision. Clegg wrote in a 2021 blogpost that Trumpâs accounts would need to be strictly monitored in the event of his return. How the âguardrailsâ could work Announcing the decision on Wednesday, Clegg said Metaâs âguardrailsâ would include taking action against content that does not directly violate their community standards but âcontributes to the sort of risk that materialized on January 6th, such as content that delegitimizes an upcoming election or is related to QAnonâ. Meta âmay limit the distribution of such posts, and for repeated instances, may temporarily restrict access to our advertising toolsâ, Clegg said, or âremove the re-share buttonâ from posts. Trump responded to the news with a short statement on Truth Social, reposted by others on Twitter, saying that âsuch a thing should never happen again to a sitting presidentâ but did not indicate if or when he would return to the platform. It remains to be seen if he will actually begin posting again on the platforms where his accounts have been reinstated. While he initially suggested he would be âstaying on Truth [Social]â, his own social media platform, recent reports said he was eager to return to Facebook, formally appealing to Meta to reinstate his accounts. But weeks after returning to Twitter, Trump had yet to tweet again. Some have suggested the silence has been due to an exclusivity agreement he has with Truth Social. A report from Rolling Stone said Trump planned to begin tweeting again when the agreement, which requires him to post all news to the app six hours in advance of any other platform, expires in June. Trump has a far broader reach on mainstream social platforms compared with Truth Social, where he has just 5 million followers. Many online safety advocates have warned Trumpâs return would be toxic, and Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill urged Meta in a December letter to uphold the ban. Representative Adam Schiff, a Democrat who previously chaired the House intelligence committee, criticized the decision to reinstate him. âTrump incited an insurrection,â Schiff wrote on Twitter. âGiving him back access to a social media platform to spread his lies and demagoguery is dangerous.â Trumpâs account has remained online even after his ban, but he had been unable to publish new posts. Civil rights groups say that regardless of the former presidentâs future actions the Meta decision marks a dangerous precedent. âWhether he uses the platforms or not, a reinstatement by Meta sends a message that there are no real consequences even for inciting insurrection and a coup on their channels,â said a group of scholars, advocates and activists calling itself the Real Facebook Oversight Board in a statement. âSomeone who has violated their terms of service repeatedly, spread disinformation on their platforms and fomented violence would be welcomed back.â Reuters contributed reporting",Guardian,26/01/2023,"Trumpâs Facebook and Instagram ban to be lifted, Meta announces",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/25/trump-facebook-ban-lifted-unbanned-instagram-meta-pages-latest
13,"The oversight board of Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has recommended an overhaul of the platforms' rules banning bare-chested images of women but not men. The board's decision follows Facebook's censorship of two posts showing a transgender and non-binary American couple posing topless with their nipples covered. The board found that the policy was based on a binary view of gender and recommended defining clear, objective criteria that respect international human rights standards. While advocates welcome the move, concerns remain about how Meta's automated content-moderation systems will distinguish between topless posts and pornography.","Facebook and Instagramâs parent company could soon free the nipple. More than a decade after breastfeeding mothers first held a ânurse-inâ at Facebookâs headquarters to protest against its ban on breasts, Metaâs oversight board has called for an overhaul to the companyâs rules banning bare-chested images of women â but not men. In a decision dated 17 January, the oversight board â a group of academics, politicians, and journalists who advise the company on its content-moderation policies â recommended that Meta change its adult nudity and sexual activity community standard âso that it is governed by clear criteria that respect international human rights standardsâ. The oversight boardâs ruling follows Facebookâs censorship of two posts from an account run by an American couple who are transgender and non-binary. The posts showed the couple posing topless, but with their nipples covered, with captions describing trans healthcare and raising money for top surgery. The posts were flagged by users, then reviewed and removed by an AI system. After the couple appealed the decision, Meta eventually restored the posts. The board found that âthe policy is based on a binary view of gender and a distinction between male and female bodiesâ, which makes rules against nipple-baring âunclearâ when it comes to intersex, non-binary and transgender users. It recommended that Meta âdefine clear, objective, rights-respecting criteriaâ when it comes to moderating nudity âso that all people are treated in a manner consistent with international human rights standardsâ. âLactivistsâ spent the 2000s attempting to squash the image of breasts as inherently sexual, and the campaign to #FreetheNipple went mainstream in 2013. The phrase entered pop-feminist parlance in 2013 after Facebook took down clips from the actor/director Lina Escoâs documentary Free the Nipple. The campaign gained wide support on college campuses and was championed by celebrities including Rihanna, Miley Cyrus and Lena Dunham. As recently as last week, Florence Pugh addressed wearing a sheer, hot pink Valentino gown on the red carpet, saying: âOf course, I donât want to offend people, but I think my point is: how can my nipples offend you that much?â In 2015, the Los Angeles-based artist Micol Hebron created stickers of male nipples â which are permitted on Instagram â so that female Instagram users could superimpose them over their own to mock the disparity. Hebron was invited to Instagramâs headquarters in 2019 with a group of influencers to talk about the companyâs nipple policy. âDuring that meeting, we learned that there were no transgender people on the content moderation policy team, and I also observed that there were no gender-neutral bathrooms there,â Hebron said. âTo me, that was all I needed to know to understand the conversation of gender and inclusivity was not being had at Meta.â A Meta representative disputed Hebronâs characterization of the event, adding: âMuch has changed since 2019.â But Hebron said she was âexcitedâ that the oversight board had taken up the issue of gender and sex-based discrimination. âBeyond just âletâs let women be toplessâ, which is not at all my interest, I think itâs really important to hold on to the goal of allowing all bodies to have autonomy,â Hebron said. âIt sounds so frivolous to a lot of people to talk about nipples, but if you think about the ways that governments around the world try to control and repress female-identifying bodies, trans bodies or non-binary bodies, itâs not.â Meta âwelcomes the boardâs decision in this caseâ, a representative said in a statement that noted that the coupleâs photos had been reinstated âprior to the decisionâ. âWe are constantly evolving our policies to help make our platforms safer for everyone,â the spokesperson added. âWe know more can be done to support the LGBTQ+ community, and that means working with experts and LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations on a range of issues and product improvements.â Meta has 60 days to respond publicly to the boardâs recommendations. While advocates may welcome the idea of a freer nipple online, questions remain about how Metaâs automated content-moderation systems will be able to enforce a new policy on nipples. A couple fundraising to afford top surgery is not the same as someone soliciting sex online, but the companyâs AI did not recognize the difference in the post at first. So how will these systems be able to tell the difference between a topless post and porn? âContext is everything, and algorithms are terrible at context,â Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism, told the Guardian. âThe interesting question will be the tension over how Meta can create new rules without opening the floodgates to porn, which is why those rules exist in the first place. That ought to be possible, but Iâm skeptical of whether it is if content moderation is automated.â (Bell previously held several positions at the Guardian, including non-executive director of the Scott Trust.) Facebook and Instagram users can also flag posts they believe violate the companyâs policies, as they did for the photo that spurred the boardâs decision. âIt doesnât take a genius to work out that there are certain areas of the culture wars where content moderation gets weaponized,â Bell said. âA post about top surgery should not have been flagged in the first place, but it was. This could have been the actions of an anti-trans bad actor.â Jillian York, an activist and director of international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, added that it was âtrickyâ for companies that use AI to make the right decision in every scenario. âFor instance, itâs not easy for an automated technology to make a decision about who is a topless adult, versus who is a topless child,â she said. âAI may be able to make a determination between a nine-year-old and a 26-year-old, but what about a 17-year-old and an 18-year-old?â Sarah Murnen, the Samuel B Cummings II professor of psychology at Kenyon College, said the Free the Nipple movement had once centered white, cisgender women â but that was changing. âWhen we talked about this as an issue about cis women, it seemed less important, potentially, than it is now with trans people wanting to be open about their bodies, while anti-trans sentiment is at an all-time-high,â she said. Now, Meta has been advised to loosen the restrictive, binary way it polices bodies online. But many are quick to doubt AIâs potential to protect all users. âThatâs the big lesson of all of this: when you create automated systems, youâre going to have consequences for people who are more marginalized, or the minority in society,â said Bell. âThose are the people who are penalized by the application of an algorithm.â",Guardian,18/01/2023,Free the nipple: Facebook and Instagram told to overhaul ban on bare breasts,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/17/free-the-nipple-meta-facebook-instagram
14,"The oversight board at Meta, the owner of Instagram, has overruled the social media platform's decision to delete a track by drill artist Chinx, who was recently released from prison. The board found that the police's claim that the track could lead to retaliatory violence was unfounded and criticized the breach of free speech principles. However, Chinx now faces new license conditions, including notifying the police and probation service of any releases and avoiding incitement or encouragement of violence. The case sheds light on the state's approach to drill music and the restrictions faced by artists in the genre.","Since being released from prison on licence last October, drill artist Chinx (OS), from the Regentâs Park Estate in north-west London, has written 17 music tracks. Each one could have sent the 24-year-old, desperate not to fall back into his past life after serving four years of an eight-year sentence for possession of a firearm with intent to harm, back to jail. This week, the oversight board at Meta, the owner of Instagram, overruled a decision by the social media platform, made in January on the request of the Met police, to delete one of Chinxâs tracks, Secrets not Safe, from the site. His own Instagram account was also deleted. In a development that hit the headlines, the board found that Scotland Yardâs claim to Instagram that the track could lead to âretaliatory violenceâ was not founded, adding that basic principles of free speech, equality and transparency had been breached in allowing a police operation to censor a musician in secret. But Chinx, who has asked for his real name not to be used, says the story does not stop there. âTheyâve given me new licence conditions which are to notify the police and probation service within 24 hours of any release, yeah, and to also have lyrics attached to that,â the young musician says, speaking from an estate in St Johnâs Wood, north London. âThereâs no approval phase. So, itâs not like I send in my lyrics and they say yeah, and you can release this. It is just you have to let us know, deliver the tunes out and if you mess up, you mess up.â He goes on: âA second condition is to not incite or encourage what is reasonably seen as inciting violence around gang hostility. Quite broad. Itâs not really fair. âReasonably seenâ is whatever the police see as a problem.â A misstep could lead to four more years in jail. The case highlights the unprecedented approach taken by the state to drill, a form of rap music that originated from the streets of Chicago, and is notable for its focus on violence and its dark provocative lyrics, fast beats and haunting melodies. In 2019, drill rappers Skengdo and AM were given suspended prison sentences for performing a song in a particular postcode and containing certain lyrics. As part of its investigation into the removal of the track, Metaâs oversight board found that the Met had filed 286 requests to take down or review posts about drill music in the 12 months from June 2021, and that 255 of those had resulted in the removal of content. The police contend that, rather than over-policing a form of music enjoyed predominantly by young black men, they are trying to keep them safe. Chinx, while recognising the excesses of some, says he is just trying to turn his life around and this music, reflecting on the life he knows, offers him a chance. Chinx, nicknamed after his resemblance to a US drill artist of the same name, had 12 convictions to his name before being arrested for possession of a Walther P38 pistol in 2017. He spent four years in seven prisons, including HMPs Belmarsh and Wormwood Scrubs. He performs with his face covered, and maintains anonymity as he seeks to keep his music and family life separate. But he wants, he says, to stay away from the lifestyle he once had on north Londonâs Regent Park Estate. It is why he is churning out his music despite the perilous restrictions encircling him. âEvery moment counts,â he says. âThatâs my mindset. Iâve been behind so Iâve got to do what Iâve got to do three or four times harder.â His work, he says, is entertainment, no matter the violence. The track that was deleted by Instagram was largely fiction. His other works, including those due to appear on a forthcoming album out next February, reflect on his life in jail. How, he asks, is the celebration of violence in Hollywood movies any different to his own? âTo me, it is similar to a James Bond film,â he says. âJames Bond is an MI5 officer who does contract killings. Yeah. So I mean, thatâs his job as a profession when you make a whole movie out of it and make it seem like itâs cool to go around killing. All you can control is what you can control â me as an individual. I canât control what someone else is going to do based on my lyrics.â",Guardian,25/11/2022,Met monitoring song lyrics of rap artist it tried to censor on Instagram,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/25/met-monitoring-song-lyrics-of-rap-artist-it-tried-to-censor-on-instagram
15,"Meta's oversight board has compelled the company to reinstate a clip of drill music on Instagram that was removed at the request of the Metropolitan police. The board ruled that the removal was a mistake and that the track did not violate Facebook or Instagram's rules. It criticized the breach of free speech, equality, and transparency principles, emphasizing the need for independent evaluation of law enforcement requests regarding artistic expression from marginalized groups. The board also raised concerns about potential over-policing of certain communities and called for a public and standardized system for content removal requests.","Metaâs oversight board, the quasi-independent âsupreme courtâ of Facebook and Instagram, has forced the company to reinstate a clip of drill music originally removed from Instagram at the request of the Metropolitan police. The clip, a short excerpt of the song Secrets Not Safe by Chinx (OS), was removed after the Met flagged the track to Meta, arguing that it could lead to âretaliatory violenceâ in the context of the London gang scene. The force told Meta it contained a âveiled threatâ, referencing a shooting in 2017, and as a result the company manually removed 52 posts containing the track and automated systems removed it a further 112 times. Now, the oversight board says those removals were a mistake. The track does not break Facebook or Instagramâs rules, it argues, and basic principles of free speech, equality and transparency were breached in allowing a police operation to censor a musician in secret. âWhile law enforcement can sometimes provide context and expertise, not every piece of content that law enforcement would prefer to have taken down should be taken down,â the board said in its ruling. âIt is therefore critical that Meta evaluates these requests independently, particularly when they relate to artistic expression from individuals in minority or marginalised groups for whom the risk of cultural bias against their content is acute.â As part of its investigation into the removal of the track, the oversight board filed multiple freedom of information requests with the Met police, finding that the force had filed 286 requests to take down or review posts about drill music in the 12 months from June 2021, and that 255 of those had resulted in the removal of content. Over the same period, it had not made a single request to remove any other music genre, the force said. âThis intensive focus on one music genre among many that include reference to violence raises serious concerns of potential over-policing of certain communities,â the board argued. The board also asked the Met how it ensured that free speech rights were protected, and what its specific policies were about flagging content to social networks. The force said it was unable to answer, with decisions made on a case-by-case basis. Crucially, the Met did not allege any of the drill music that it had asked Meta to take down had broken UK law. Instead, its argument was that the music had broken Facebook and Instagramâs community standards, since it was âpotentially threatening or likely to contribute to imminent violence or physical harmâ. The police did not provide public evidence to back up that claim. Because the internal Meta team that works with the police comprises senior specialists, users whose content is taken down also have no ability to appeal. In a statement, Meta said: âWe do not remove content simply because law enforcement requests it â we take action if content is found to violate our policies or local law. As part of our robust review process, we assess whether a request is consistent with internationally-recognised standards on human rights, including due process, privacy, free expression and the rule of law.â The oversight board recommended that, in the future, Meta should have a public and standardised system for content removal requests from law enforcement and other state actors, including asking for evidence to back up claims that a policy has been violated, and to review its decisions in aggregate to assess for systemic biases against communities or minorities. Although it is funded by Meta, and its co-chairs were selected by the social network, the oversight board operates largely independently, and has the power to overrule the moderation teams of Facebook and Instagram, and to force content to be reinstated to the site, as it has done in this case. It can also issue non-binding recommendations for the companyâs future policies, which Meta reserves the right to refuse but has agreed to respond to even if it decides not to enact them.",Guardian,22/11/2022,Instagram told to reinstate music video removed at request of Met police,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/22/instagram-told-to-reinstate-music-video-removed-at-request-of-met-police

17,"Matt, a climate scientist and self-proclaimed social media virgin, reflects on the growing awareness among longtime social media users about the vulnerabilities and downsides of platforms like Twitter and Instagram. Concerned about privacy, data, algorithmic manipulation, and the addictive nature of social media, Matt has never joined any social media platform. While he acknowledges the difficulties of leaving established networks, he believes there may be another way to live without constant online engagement. Others who have quit social media platforms have found more time, peace of mind, and opportunities for personal growth, indicating a potential shift away from mass-market platforms towards smaller, community-focused alternatives.","Matt* shouldâve joined Twitter years ago. He fits the user profile perfectly: highly educated, a politics junkie, across the news, loves a debate, and heâs a climate scientist. But unlike many users publicly grappling with Elon Muskâs new universe, threatening to jump ship (but then lingering on the deck), or trying to muster the energy to migrate to another platform and, ahem, âtootâ, Matt is a social media virgin. Unblemished, unsullied â the 46-year-old has never joined a single social media platform. âIâm not very quick to pick up and run with new technologies,â says Matt from the Victorian town of Geelong, âbut that lag time meant that I began to see things I didnât like about their adoption.â Along with privacy and data concerns, he figured most algorithms encouraged outrage and constant use. Like a true scientist, brevity (and committing casual comments to the public record) also put him off: âI didnât know what could be usefully said in 140 characters.â Twitter might be a social media minnow (29.5% of Australian internet users use it at least once a month, compared to Facebook at 76.8%) but watching people tweeting about whether to stay or go in real time is instructive. Itâs a snapshot of a growing awareness among longtime social media users (and people who still dimly remember a time before the internet) about how vulnerable they are to changing algorithms (and owners) and what drew them to social media in the first place. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup And perhaps unicorns like Matt can show us that thereâs another way to live entirely, that maybe we donât need to Google the word âMastodonâ? Maybe we just â¦ stop? âItâs hard to be that person because most of your networks are there and youâve invested all this time, energy and content. Thereâs a cost to leaving,â says Jordan Guiao, Research Fellow at The Australia Instituteâs Centre for Responsible Technology and author of the new book Disconnect. âThe big platforms rely on that. Everybody knows that theyâre bad news now, but physically moving is still really hard.â The trends arenât exactly reflective of Mattâs monastic stance. By the end of 2021, 82.7% of Australians were active on social media, an annual growth of nearly 1 million users, nudged along by an isolating pandemic and the growth of TikTok. As social media becomes baked into our daily online diet, how does it feel to be excluded from the conversation? I interrogate Matt in the same way I might approach a time traveller from the 1880s, or a very smart baby. How do you keep up with the news? âRadio, print, online.â The zeitgeist? âMost of the time it gets reported there if itâs noteworthy.â What do you do with all your spare time? âI think about it the opposite way around. Where do people find the time to be on social media?â Leaving the Las Vegas (internet) Felicia Semple, 48, from Melbourne fell off Instagram in May. She still hasnât hasnât explained her absence to her not insubstantial follower base â all 24,000 of them. âIt initially happened by accident. I decided I wouldnât post while I was away on holiday, but then I just couldnât make myself go back,â says Semple. Semple started a blog called The Craft Sessions in 2013 to âprovide a space for crafters to come togetherâ to share ideas and inspire each other. Increasingly, Semple wrote about the connection between mental health and crafting, or âthe head stuffâ as she calls it. Joining Instagram initially grew her community in very meaningful ways. But more recently, âevery time Iâd open it I would feel dread, rather than joy. It had become a chore â a stressful, anxiety-ridden ethically-dubious space.â Like many artists recently whoâve built whole careers on the platform, Instagramâs algorithm changes (mainly mirroring the TikTok model of snack-sized video) changed everything. âThe requirements of the algorithm had changed the type of content I was creating,â says Semple. âIt was warping my own creative impulses and my message, by messing with my biology, making me feel that I needed to keep up.â âThe most popular platforms want us to be there with 24/ 7 engagement at all costs,â says Guaio. âThe way social media is built is Las Vegas crazy, super bright and completely addictive. In the real world we donât live like that.â We need to âstart to think about a healthier way of doing it â¦ develop platforms that donât have this kind of extractive business model that relies on us being there every second of the day, or â¦ getting dopamine hits for every like.â Semple knows that the decision to quit Instagram was a luxury, as she wasnât relying on it for income. Many people whoâve built their businesses on social media feel like they have no choice but to adapt. But these days sheâs sleeping better. âI have more time and peace of mind. I finished my psychology degree last week.â Given all that, Semple is thinking of ways to engage with her online community again. âIâve read three books in one monthâ Forty-five year-old Olivia Sinclair Smith works in education. She quit her platform of choice, Facebook, a month ago. Sheâd tried to leave before, but this time she went cold turkey. âI was just mindlessly scrolling through posts and peopleâs bits and pieces and wasting more and more time doing it. I started to feel guilty afterwards, like I was addicted and I couldnât stop.â Since quitting, âI donât feel the guilt and the self-loathing I used to get from staring at crap posted by people I barely know â¦ Iâve read three books in the last month which is unheard of for me.â Sinclair Smith has strategically kept a slice of the platform â Facebook Marketplace. âI made a fake profile which has no friends attached and I use that to look at items to buy.â âI am tempted to join the interest groups using my fake profile,â says Sinclair Smith, but sheâs worried it could be âa gateway drugâ. A great rebalancing? Guiao says people are becoming more discerning. âWe are seeing a bit of a move away from the giant, public, mass-market platforms into smaller and more community focused platforms and private messaging like WhatsApp,â he says. âWeâre actually going back to how we naturally communicate in our physical or our real-world social networks.â Guiao says to expect ourselves to disconnect entirely is unrealistic, especially digital natives. âWeâre going be online now for the rest of our lives. But thereâs something to be said for rebalancing it,â says Guiao. How that rebalancing will work for younger users embracing more broadcast platforms like TikTok and YouTube remains to be seen. For users looking to engage with niche topics and communities on those platforms, it can still be like running through a casino looking for the ball pit and ending up at the craps table instead. âThe challenge is that there isnât a viable alternative â¦ even if we wanted to change, itâs very difficult,â says Guiao. Guiao points to Eli Pariserâs work, who talks about the concept of âdigital parks as quiet spaces to gather. How do we build online versions of that? The âLas Vegasâ internet isnât an inevitability.â Remember, these places have existed. âBefore social media, there were community platforms like blogs and forums and all of those things that [were] built for connection, community and collaboration but werenât built to get you addicted.â Matt has no desire to join the party. But heâs still forced to reckon with social media, given that his children, currently seven and nine, will eventually have to confront it. âIn the social lives of younger people, thereâs a very heavy price to pay for not engaging. All I can do is help them to understand that the priorities they have for their own lives are not even remotely aligned with those of these companies.â âI do also worry about the capacity for them to find refuge in their lives.â Most of us wonât ever be as pure as Matt, but we might get smarter at making social media work for us. Maybe tooting doesnât sound so bad after all. *Name has been changed",Guardian,11/11/2022,"The 46-year-old social media virgin: how people ditch Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and survive",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/nov/12/the-46-year-old-social-media-virgin-how-people-ditch-twitter-facebook-and-instagram-and-survive

The clips of their challenge went viral on TikTok, with one video receiving over 47 million views. However, the captions and lack of context led to vicious and sexist comments directed at Stephanie. The negative comments escalated when the video was reposted on 9gag, resulting in trolling across her social media platforms and forcing her to remove ads for her live shows. Stephanie's experience highlights the gendered and violent nature of online harassment, affecting her mental well-being and career. She emphasizes the need for a safer online environment, particularly in industries where social media presence is crucial.","COMMENT
It was a Sunday morning, Iâm a stand-up comedian and I was booked for an unusual gig. I would be sitting opposite a male comedian as we read dad jokes from the internet to each other and tried not to laugh. If we did laugh, we had to take a shot of vodka. 
It was early in the morning and Iâm allergic to alcohol so I was pretty motivated to win the challenge. 
I won 10-1. 
The challenge was filmed and turned into short clips for the relatively small Aussie TikTok account YeahMadTV. I was paid $200 and I assumed the video content would disappear into social media land like the billions of other comedy videos that no one ever sees. But thatâs not what happened. 
The clips went viral. One clip currently has over 47 million views and counting. 
Best dog joke ever written. #dadjokes#dadjokesoftheday#dadjoke#jokes#fyp#dadjokesoftiktok
The joke? What do you call a dog that can do magic? A Labra-cadabrador.
Why was it so popular? Because people hated me and left vicious, sexist comments to let me know exactly how much. The more they commented, the more views the video received. 
When the clip was posted, the important information that I was a performer in a âtry not to laugh challengeâ wasnât included. Instead, it was captioned âBest dog joke ever writtenâ so when I didnât laugh at the joke, I just looked mean.
The commentary seemed to be that how dare I, a woman, not laugh at the funny manâs joke (not his joke, a joke off the internet). I must be a Karen, a feminist, a cat lady, a [redacted] who doesnât have a sense of humour. The few people in the comments who tried to stick up for me by explaining it was a challenge, were also attacked.
I contacted YeahMadTV and they removed some of the nastiest comments and put in the comments that it was the âtry not to laughâ challenge but it didnât stop there. The video developed a life of its own. 
One anonymous account reposted the clip on 9gag, a social media platform that allows users to upload and share content from other social media sites. It was shared under the caption âShe has no sense of Humourâ. The thousands of comments on 9gag, that I canât delete, are so disgusting that I couldnât get through them.
Once I realised YeahMadTV had tagged me, I untagged myself immediately but the trolls still found me.
They wrote negative comments on every stand-up comedy clip I had on TikTok and Instagram. 
I was running ads for my live stand up shows at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and those ads all had to be removed because of the trolling. 
It is very hard to be funny when every time I tell a joke on stage, I can picture these vile comments screaming at me from the audience.
On the final night of my Melbourne Comedy Festival run I broke down. I left the stage ten minutes into my show and burst into tears. I have been performing comedy almost every single night for seven years and this has never happened to me before. I am professional and reliable. I donât cancel. I built my reputation on being âthe chick that doesnât cancelâ.
Yes, of course, men get negative comments online too, but this was different. The language was gendered. It was violent. It was threatening. The attacks were intended to silence me, intimidate me and humiliate me, because I had committed a mortal sin of womanhood, not laughing at a manâs crappy joke. I know Iâm the least objective person in this situation but itâs hard to deny the lashings of misogyny. 
Sure, I could delete social media. If I stop putting myself out there, then people will stop trolling me. But I am a stand-up comedian. This is my job. Part of that job is promoting myself online and I deserve to feel safe at work. 
Itâs not just the arts where a strong social media presence is a requirement. Social media is an integral part of most careers. Nearly every employer checks you out online before hiring you, so to say âjust ignore itâ is completely unreasonable.
Thatâs asking me to ignore the cheapest and most efficient way to promote myself. âDonât worry about itâ or âdonât post things if you donât want to get attackedâ does not resolve the issue. I am worried about it. Itâs disgusting, itâs sexist and itâs ruining my career.
Given social media is an important part of our work life and women are trolled more than men how is that workplace equality? Why are we accepting trolling as a consequence of being online?
The number of women in comedy I have spoken to that have received similar treatment online is truly horrifying. Some have quit comedy, some have been seeking mental health treatment ever since, some just put up with it as part of the deal.
I donât have a solution, but I would suggest that next time you are tempted to write a mean comment on a random clip for no other reason except that youâre bored, maybe donât.

1,"Eddy May, an Australian driver, found himself stranded when a tyre on his electric Mercedes-Benz EQC-400 went flat. He used the car's in-car customer service feature to call Mercedes and arrange a tow truck. While praising the company's response, May raised concerns about electric vehicles lacking spare tyres due to space limitations caused by batteries. Some viewers criticized the inconvenience of needing a tow truck and taxi instead of a simple tyre change. Despite the incident, May defended the environmental benefits of electric vehicles, highlighting their lower emissions compared to traditional cars.","An Australian driver has revealed a glaring problem with electric vehicles after finding himself stranded on the side of the road when one of his tyres went flat.
Eddy May was driving home in his electric Mercedes-Benz EQC-400 on Sunday just before midday when his rear left wheel deflated, leaving him and his wife stranded on the side of the road in Adelaide. 
Making use of an in-car customer service offered in the luxury model, he pressed a button and spent five minutes on the phone with Mercedes about the tyre.
âIâve spoken to them, theyâre sending a tow truck,â Mr May told his followers in a clip shared to TikTok. 
âQuick five minutes on the phone, a $200 cab charge voucher to get home, [and the] carâs going to get towed to Mercedes and the carâs going to be fixed tomorrow apparently,â he said. 
About 35 minutes later, the $128,000 vehicle was loaded onto a tow truck and the coupleâs taxi arrived. 
By just after 12pm, they were on their way home. 
âPretty good. Well done Mercedes,â Mr May said. 
But his video praising Mercedes for their service raised questions over why a spare tyre wasnât kept inside the car as it would be for petrol cars. 
âThereâs no spare in this f**king car because all the room is taken up with batteries and so forth,â Mr May said. 
Most electric vehicles donât come with spare tyres given the extra space and weight they require. 
âI would be severely unimpressed with needing a tow truck, taxi ride, loan car and what 1-2 days without my car over a flat tyre,â one comment on the video read. 
âI would much prefer the 10 minutes to change the tyre,â another wrote. 
âGreat service, interesting way of saving the planet and reducing carbon emissions. Taxi ride and tow truck compared with carrying a spare tyre,â a third said. 
Mr May argued the vehicle still worked out to be friendlier on the environment overall, even though it used a lot of resources when a tyre blew out. 
In response to someone who described the car a âjokeâ, he said it was still ahead in terms of emissions. 
â24,000 kms with no petrol or oil and 38 kms on a diesel truck. I still think itâs doing okay,â he said.

The dangerous trend, which started in 2022, has led to hospitalizations among Australian teens. The boy, Jacob Stevens, experienced seizures and was rushed to the hospital, where he was kept on life support for six days before his family made the heartbreaking decision to let him pass. Jacob's father is now raising awareness about the dangers of social media challenges and advocating for age restrictions on over-the-counter drugs and platforms like TikTok. The US FDA has issued a warning about the risks of the ""Benadryl Challenge.""","A 13-year-old boy in the US has died after taking part in a viral TikTok challenge. 
The challenge involves swallowing up to 14 benadryl pills â an antihistamine allergy medication â to induce hallucinations, with participants then posting videos of their experience on social media. 
Believed to have been started in 2022, the trend has already caused a spate of hospitalisations among Australian teens attempting to participate.
Jacob Stevens from Ohio began to seize up after ingesting a lethal dose.
He was immediately rushed to the hospital as his body began to shut down. 
Tragically, after six days on life support, his family made the heart-wrenching decision to let him pass, as his brain functions had ceased.
Jacobâs father, Justin, is now dedicated to warning parents and teens of the dangers of social media and has shared a photo of Jacob hooked up to life support in the hospital to spread awareness.
âIt was too much for his body,â the grieving father said via ABC 6, recalling the âworst day of his lifeâ.
âNo brain scan, there was nothing there. They said we could keep him on the vent, that he could lay there, but he will never open his eyes, heâll never breathe, smile, walk or talk.â
âIt didnât matter how bad of a day I was having, no one could make me smile, Jacob could make me smile,â Justin recalled through tears.
Justin and his family have also begun pushing politicians to take steps to prevent other kids from partaking in such challenges by putting age restrictions on over-the-counter drugs like Benadryl. 
He has also suggested imposing an age restriction for creating accounts on TikTok, forcing users to provide identification before being allowed on the platform.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a statement warning of the dangers of participating in the âBenadryl Challengeâ and is aware of reports of teenagers ending up in emergency rooms or dying after taking part.
âTaking higher than recommended doses of the common over-the-counter (OTC) allergy medicine diphenhydramine (Benadryl) can lead to serious heart problems, seizures, coma or even death,â the FDA wrote.
âWe are aware of news reports of teenagers ending up in emergency rooms or dying after participating in the Benadryl Challenge encouraged in videos posted on the social media application TikTok.â
Queensland Ambulance Service confirmed an alarming number of call-outs in recent weeks after the trend became popular.
Seizures and head wounds were among the injuries sustained for those who took part, QAS said.
âThere were four calls in one hour in South East Queensland and all of those children needed transport to hospital,â a spokeswoman said last year.
Among the harmful side effects from high doses are seizures and a racing heart rate.
Its damage has been so far reaching, the trend prompted drug manufacturer Johnson and Johnson to issue a warning in its popularityâs wake.
âWe understand that consumers may have heard about an online âchallengeâ involving the misuse or abuse of diphenhydramine,â the company said.
âThis challenge, which involves the ingestion of excessive quantities of diphenhydramine, is a dangerous trend and should be stopped immediately.â",news.com.au,2023-04-18T05:55:53Z,Benadryl Challenge: US teenager dies after trying TikTok trend,https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/social/us-teenager-dies-after-trying-tiktok-benadryl-challenge/news-story/2f4a992dd19a9c65150774d2b7623b2e
3,"A former Chinese diplomat criticized Australia's TikTok ban on government devices, calling it ""racism"" and warning against creating an enemy with 1.4 billion people. The Australian government imposed the ban due to security concerns and fears of data harvesting by the Chinese-owned platform. Cybersecurity experts have highlighted the app's extensive data collection capabilities. However, TikTok Australia's general manager denied the risk and stated that TikTok is an entertainment platform, not China. Several other countries, including the US, UK, and France, have also implemented bans or restrictions on TikTok over cybersecurity concerns.","A former Chinese diplomat has labelled Australiaâs TikTok ban on government devices âracismâ, telling the Government: âYou do not want to have an enemy with 1.4 billion people.â
In an interview with 60 Minutes, former diplomat and CCP mouthpiece Victor Gao said of the ban: âProbably itâs racism, probably itâs racial discrimination, probably itâs banning Chinese again, which was a disaster many years ago.
âNow you want to do that again? It will not be a success.â
The Australian Government banned the Chinese-owned social media platform from all government devices, citing fears over security. It follows similar bans in many other countries around the world.
âThis has been informed by security agenciesâ advice on work thatâs been done and provided to the government, so thatâs the decision weâve taken is around government-issued devices,â Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said earlier this month.
Concerns over the scope of personal information that TikTok harvests and its parent company ByteDanceâs apparent links to the communist regime has led governments around the world to believe that China could be weaponising the social media app to spy on their citizens.
Cybersecurity expert Robert Potter previously told 60 Minutes that the app collects a lot more data than other social media sites.
âIt can collect your keystroke patterns, body language, face and body features. It can access photos or passwords that are stored in your phone over time,â he said.
âThereâs a super location field that allows them to collect which direction youâre facing, how fast youâre moving, how high off the ground you are, your latitude and longitude.â
However Mr Gao said Australia shouldnât feel threatened by the app.
âAustralians need to be really confident about their own system, rather than being threatened by TikTok. Banning it is not a sign of strength. Itâs not a sign of superiority, itâs not a sign of confidence. Itâs just the opposite,â he said.
He also said the ban could cause further tensions in Australiaâs already strained relationship with China.
âI would urge the Australian Government to really treat China as an equal, because you do not want to have an enemy with 1.4 billion people,â he said.
Meanwhile, TikTok Australia and New Zealand general manager Lee Hunter insists the ban is politically motivated, saying there was âno evidenceâ to support that peopleâs data was at risk.
He also told 60 Minutes TikTok Australia will not hand over personal information to the CCP.
âWe need to be careful about how we work with China, but at the end of the day TikTok is not China. Weâre an entertainment platform. Weâre about giving people interesting videos in their day,â he said.
All the countries that have total or partial bans on TikTok:
Australia isnât alone in its ban of TikTok from government devices. Many countries around the world have taken similar measures.
Australia: TikTok banned from all federal government-owned devices.
New Zealand: On March 17, New Zealand announced TikTok would be banned from the phones of government politicians at the end of the month. But it only applies to about 500 people in the parliamentary complex.
Estonia: At the end of March, Estoniaâs outgoing minister of IT and foreign trade, Kristjan JÃ¤rvan, said TikTok would be banned from smartphones issued by the state to public officials.
UK: On March 16, an immediate ban was announced of the app on government official devices.
EU governing bodies: The European Parliament, European Commission, and the EU Council have all banned TikTok on staff devices, citing cybersecurity concerns.
France: On March 24, the French government banned the installation and use of ârecreationalâ applications such as TikTok, Netflix and Instagram on the work phones of 2.5 million civil servants.
Netherlands: The government discourages the use of all apps from âcountries with an aggressive cyber-programâ on phones distributed by the government. TikTok wasnât mentioned by name.
Norway: On March 23, the Norwegian parliament banned TikTok from devices issued to government employees.
Belgium: On March 10, Belgium announced it was banning TikTok from devices owned or paid for by Belgiumâs federal government for at least six months.
Denmark: On March 6, Denmarkâs Defence Ministry announced it would âban the use of the app on official unitsâ as a cybersecurity measure.
USA: Government agencies were given until the end of March to delete TikTok from federal devices and systems. However some US politicians have been advocating an outright ban. However, a bid to ban TikTok from operating in the United States altogether was blocked in the senate on March 30. Now, though, Montana has passed a bill to ban TikTok outright from the state. If signed into law, it could come into effect from January 2024.
Canada: The country announced on February 28 it was banning TikTok from all government-issued devices.
India: In 2020, India imposed a ban on TikTok and some other Chinese apps, shortly after a clash between Indian and Chinese troops at a disputed Himalayan border.
Taiwan: In December 2022, Taiwan imposed a TikTok ban on all government devices.
Pakistan: Pakistani authorities have temporarily banned TikTok at least four times since October 2020, citing concerns that the app promotes immoral content.
Afghanistan: Taliban leaders banned TikTok in 2022 on the grounds of protecting youths from âbeing misledâ.",news.com.au,2023-04-16T13:13:05Z,Chinese diplomat blasts Australian Government ban on TikTok,https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/social/chinese-diplomat-calls-australia-racist-after-government-tiktok-ban/news-story/879788d1f90f8dcd867829753de1ce4c
4,"A conspiracy theorist has claimed that the construction of U-turn bays on a road in Victoria, Australia, is evidence of a plot to implement ""15-minute cities"" or ""smart cities."" The theorist believes that these cities, where essential services are located within a short distance, will restrict people's movement and increase government control. However, critics argue that the U-turn bays are simply for improved access and safety. The debate over the concept of 15-minute cities has sparked discussions online, with proponents highlighting the convenience and health benefits while skeptics raise concerns about restrictions and surveillance.","A 15-minute city conspiracy theorist has made a bold claim about the construction of multiple U-turn bays on a Victorian road, as debate over the urban-planning concept continues globally. 
In a video shared to Twitter, an Australian podcaster filmed herself driving along Narre Warren North Road which is situated 38km southeast of Melbourne and is currently undergoing upgrades.
The roadworks commenced in 2020 and are part of the state governmentâs Big Build project which entailed the addition of extra lanes, installation of traffic lights and road safety improvements. 
Final asphalting works, guardrail and signage installations, line markings and vegetation works are currently underway with the project expected to be completed by mid this year.
In line with the project, extra U-turn bays were created for safer and easier access to streets adjacent to the main road. 
However, the conspiracy theorist believes these turnaround lanes have been installed to serve a more dire purpose, believing more 15-minute or 20-minute cities are set to pop up in the future. 
Also known as smart cities, the notion is an urban development idea where everything you need access to is located within a short distance.
This may include schools, shops, GP clinics and even the office or your place of work, all within the same zone. 
The concept is the brainchild of Franco-Colombian urbanist Carlos Moreno who came up with the idea to prompt more sustainable, convenient and healthier living.
Key elements of the theory include keeping essential services close, creating a sense of community solidarity and inspiring green urban living.
However, not all are convinced, with some conspiracists comparing the theory to a Stalin-style plot to keep people in lockdown or under the governmentâs control.
In the case of the woman who filmed herself driving along Narre Warren North Road, she believes the road upgrade project will become a âCheckpoint Charlieâ for smart cities.
âThis used to be a country road. Not only are they building wires and towers but theyâre also putting in interestingly three or four U-turn opportunities,â she explained in the video.
âI guess thatâs because youâll get a warning â youâre about to leave your 20-minute city, your district, your zone (and itâs your) last chance to turn back obviously before the fines start.â
As she drives further down the road, the woman highlights three âpillars with weird blue lightsâ positioned in the middle of the road next to several parked tradie cars. 
âUp here to the right youâll see three bollards â¦ I think this right here is the checkpoint,â she claims in the video. 
âThereâs now all of these opportunities to pull a U-turn and go back the way you came.
âIn the future, going out to the countryside is not something theyâre going to allow you to do without you handing over your money.â
The tweet, which has received over 1.3 million views and 692 likes, has amassed debate over the urban planning concept online with many arguing the woman has taken her thoughts âtoo farâ.
âThis is ridiculous. U-turns, or access for emergency vehicles? Or both? Forget something and need to go back home? A U-turn is handy. This is not a nefarious thing,â one person tweeted.
â15 minute (cities) have been around for ages and have nothing to do with climate change lockdowns. Itâs literally about ease of access and reducing dependency on cars,â a second person said.
âNo one is preventing you from going further away in your car.â
A third comment read: âThe wires reduce accidents. The breaks in the wire provide access points for emergency vehicles to turn. 
âThese safety measures can be found on roads around Australia.â
Meanwhile, one man suggested the push for electric vehicles (EV) over petrol cars could be another excuse to restrict people to their âzoneâ.
âIâm thinking this is one of the major reasons they want EV versus gas vehicles, fewer and less range!â he said. 
The debate online follows huge rallies around the world as conspiracy theorists criticise the concept, which has already come into effect in 16 cities globally including Paris and Shanghai. 
Edmonton Canada was also another city which tried to implement the idea, however received backlash from its residents.
âYou will spend 90 per cent of your life in this 15-minute area as they are monitoring your carbon footprint,â a flyer circulating warned.
Meanwhile, those who agree with the theory have slammed its critics, including registered nurse Christopher Patterson and national radio broadcaster Triple J Hack. 
âThere are a lot of noted intellectuals on TikTok telling me I should be suspicious of convenience,â Triple J Hack reporter Shalailah Medhora said in a radio package last month. 
Dr Patterson, who is also a University of Wollongong lecturer, explained there are numerous health benefits to the theory that many sceptics are overlooking.
âThe main (benefit) is giving people back their freedom (and) time,â Dr Patterson said.
âThe time you get back you could put into (your) health or sitting in green spaces to connect back with your community and family.â",news.com.au,2023-04-18T04:26:22Z,15-minute cities: Womanâs bizarre claim about Victorian road project,https://www.news.com.au/technology/motoring/on-the-road/checkpoint-charlie-woman-makes-wild-smart-city-claim-about-victorian-road/news-story/d5a6df870d6b7b29f73330371624b62c

6,"Dr. Gerry Curatola, a dentist and founder of Rejuvenation Dentistry, cautions against four dental practices that can negatively impact dental health. He discourages the use of mouthwash, stating that it may contain preservatives harmful to the mouth's microbiome. Curatola criticizes root canals, citing risks and the presence of dead tissue. He warns that charcoal toothpaste can be abrasive and erode tooth enamel. Furthermore, he advises against metal fillings due to the potential release of mercury vapor and suggests alternative options like ceramic, porcelain, or resin fillings.","A dentist has revealed the four mistakes people make that wreak havoc on their smiles â and they have nothing to do with nightmarish TikTok challenges.
Dr. Gerry Curatola, who founded New York-based Rejuvenation Dentistry, is advising against some commonplace dental practices â such as brushing with charcoal toothpaste and undergoing root canals.
Heâs even condemned a common product sold at supermarkets.
Mouthwash
Put down the Listerine, the enamel expert argues.
âMouthwash has absolutely no value in oral care,â he cautioned to the Daily Mail in an interview published Saturday. âItâs another man-made creation by the consumer products industry.â
Despite guidance that certain mouthwashes can keep bacteria, plaque, tooth decay and gingivitis at bay, Curatola insists they could cause harm.
He claims some mouthwashes contain preservatives, such as parabens, that can destroy the mouthâs microbiome.
âIâm always amazed that dentists are giving people little bottles of mouthwash on their cleaning visit thatâs loaded with alcohol, artificial dyes and colours like that fluorescent blue colour, made from coal tar, which is a known carcinogen,â Curatola said.
According to Healthline, mouthwashes can be harmful if overused.
Experts warn against frequent mouthwash usage due to potential teeth staining from dyes, removal of the healthy microbiome and a potential cancer risk, for which there is limited evidence.
Root canals
Over 41,000 root canals are performed every day in America â but Curatola refuses to be part of that trend.
âItâs the only procedure we do where we keep human dead tissue inside you,â he explained.
The treatment involves removing bacteria and decay from the tooth, disinfecting the area, filling the roots, and sealing them to prevent further decay.
Not only are they painful and, like any procedure, carry risks, but they have also been linked to increased endotoxin levels. However, there is limited research on the phenomenon.
âThese are bacteria and bacterial by-products that can dysregulate your immune system. So theyâre really not healthy for the patient long term,â Curatola said.
Healthline dispelled the purported connection between cancer and root canals, arguing the âmythâ causes unnecessary fear in those who would benefit from the procedure.
Root canal risks include persistent infections, improper seals and inadequate filling, but the greatest risk could be an untreated canal.
Charcoal toothpaste
Activated charcoal has surged in popularity with promises of whitening teeth and providing fresh breath.
But Curatola warns it can be abrasive and even ruin tooth enamel.
âItâs the equivalent of using Ajax on your teeth,â he explained. âIf youâre brushing with it every day, youâre going to wave your enamel away, and your teeth are going to get more sensitive.â
Despite being sold by Colgate and other major dental brands, limited research has suggested that charcoal toothpaste may be too abrasive for everyday use and often does not contain fluoride, the mineral that facilitates a healthy smile.
Metal fillings
While not as widespread anymore, metal fillings were once commonplace in dentistry.
The fillings, also called dental amalgam, are often a mixture of liquid mercury and powdered alloy.
The mercury content in the fillings has the potential to release mercury vapour into the mouth, which could be inhaled by the lungs.
Mercury exposure has been linked to numerous adverse health affects, prompting a 2020 warning against the use of metal fillings in high-risk individuals.
Curatola recommends other options, such as ceramic, porcelain or resin fillings.

7,"Australia is planning to implement world-first reforms on vaping, including banning the importation of most vapes, introducing plain packaging, and removing them from convenience store shelves. Health Minister Mark Butler aims to address the behavioral crisis of vaping in schools by cracking down on illegal sales and implementing tougher regulations. Experts warn about the public health risks posed by vaping, particularly among children, who are more likely to take up smoking. The proposed reforms also involve working with states and territories to end vape sales in retail settings and restricting advertising on social media platforms.","Australia is set to ban the importation of most vapes, introduce plain packaging and strip them from convenience store shelves under world-first reforms.
The biggest crackdown on e-cigarettes in Australian history is set to be unveiled in the May budget amid fears vaping has emerged as a serious behavioural crisis in schools across the nation.
Under current laws vapes with nicotine can only be bought with a prescription from a chemist. 
But that hasnât stopped thousands of convenience stores and online providers selling to kids.
Health Minister Mark Butler will unveil the changes on Tuesday under a crackdown that will also involve the states and territories moving to stamp out the growing black market in illegal vaping.
The changes will include tough new laws to:
- Stop the import of non-prescription vapes
- Increase the minimum quality standards for vapes including by restricting flavours, colours, and other ingredients;
- Require pharmaceutical-like packaging;
- Reduce the allowed nicotine concentrations and volumes; and
- Ban all single use, disposable vapes.
But the reforms wonât stop there, with the Albanese Government preparing to work with states and territories to close down the sale of vapes in retail settings, ending vape sales in convenience stores and other retail settings.
Health experts fear the rise of vapes poses a public health crisis with children who vape three times as likely to take up smoking.
Experts claim thousands of children can no longer sit still in class because they are addicted to vaping after smoking âbubblegumâ flavours that secretly contain nicotine.
Health Minister Mark Butler said it was clear that governments had to act.
âVaping was sold to governments and communities around the world as a therapeutic product to help long-term smokers quit,ââ he said.
âIt was not sold as a recreational product - especially not one for our kids. But that is what it has become: the biggest loophole in Australian history.
âOne in six teenagers aged 14-17 has vaped. One in four people aged 18-24 has vaped. By contrast, only one in 70 people my age has vaped.
âAnd when more than a thousand teenagers aged 15 to 17 were asked where they could get vapes, four out of five of them said they found it easy or somewhat easy to buy them in retail stores.
âThis is a product targeted at our kids, sold alongside lollies and chocolate bars.â
Mr Butler said schools were now struggling to deal with the fallout.
âVaping has become the number one behavioural issue in high schools. And itâs becoming widespread in primary schools,â he said.
âOver the past 12 months, Victoriaâs poisons hotline has taken 50 calls about children under 4 becoming sick from ingesting or using a vape.
âUnder the age of 4! Vapes contain 200 toxic chemicals that do not belong in the lungs, the same chemicals youâll find in nail polish remover and weed killer.
âJust like they did with smoking, Big Tobacco has taken another addictive product, wrapped it in shiny packaging and added flavours to create a new generation of nicotine addicts.
 âVapers are three times as likely to take up smoking, which explains why under 25s are the only cohort in the community currently recording an increase in smoking rates.
âThis must end.â
Vape police could be rolled out to monitor the sale of e-cigarettes to children across Australia including on TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram under a plan that will ban most imports and introduce plain packaging.
VicHealth CEO Sandro Demaio, a globally-renowned public health expert and medical doctor, told news.com.au that as soon as the Albanese Government introduced new import bans enforcement could be much tougher at a state level.
âIn many ways this explosion of vaping has really come out of nowhere over just a couple of years,ââ he said.
âBut the reverse is also possible if we ban the advertising of vapes and actually clamp down on the use of social media to promote these products.
âIf we make them less alluring, so they donât they donât come in Froot Loops flavour and look like a highlighter. They donât have unicorns on the side. That will make them far less appealing.
âAnd basically cut off the tap at the border. Those things will absolutely make a huge difference.â
Dr Demaio said that introducing plain packaging was important because that would then allow enforcement to swing into action.
âObviously, we want to close the access and the huge amount of vapes that have been finding their way into the hands of particularly young people,ââ he said.
âSo what needs to happen at the state level is that there needs to be a licensing scheme in every state.
âThe licences themselves would create revenue, which can support enforcement officers, so weâre not relying on police to enforce the measures that we currently have.
âIn theory, theyâre not currently subject to the laws because they donât contain nicotine. But the vast majority do contain nicotine; theyâre just simply not putting in all the packets.
âAnd really, what needs to be done is to say, âWell, if thereâs no flavours, no colours and the only pathway through a prescription, and they, they, they have pharmaceutical packaging, it then makes it much easier for the states to actually enforce it.â
He warned children were being âviciouslyâ exploited.
âWell, whatâs happened over the last few years is that the tobacco industry and the e-cigarette industry, of which thereâs huge overlap, has seen an opportunity to, you know, get another entire generation of Australians addicted to nicotine with a new product. Thatâs flown under the radar,ââ he said.
âThis industry has used young peopleâs social media. These things are all over social media. You can jump on Tik Tok and there are ads for E cigarettes with a âBuy Nowâ button.
âSocial media is under-regulated in this country. They have flooded the market with really cheap imports from overseas that donât declare that they contain nicotine.
âAnd itâs been a combination of social media, weaponising their data on social media and flooding the market with really cheap and highly addictive imports.â",news.com.au,2023-05-01T13:32:48Z,Australian Government announces crackdown on illegal black market vapes,https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/australian-government-announces-crackdown-on-illegal-black-market-vapes/news-story/9771ff97a465a95b49945da68b61fb00
0,"Missouri Republican senator Josh Hawley criticizes social media influencer Andrew Tate for promoting toxic masculinity and mistreating women in his new book. Hawley compares Tate's behavior to that of a child pretending to be a man. While Hawley's mention of ""a locker room"" could be seen as a reference to former President Donald Trump, he avoids mentioning Trump in the book. Hawley has been viewed as a potential contender for the Republican nomination in 2024 but denies rumors of being Trump's running mate. The senator's book discusses the negative influence of pornography on American men but does not address Trump's controversial history with women.","In his new book, the Missouri Republican senator Josh Hawley derides Andrew Tate, a social media influencer and self-proclaimed âking of toxic masculinityâ, for âsleeping with as many women as possible, berating them, abusing them and celebrating it all as manly, as âfreedomââ. Criticising Tate for âfake bravadoâ and âendless boastingâ, Hawley adds: âEvery man who has been in a locker room recognises the type â¦ those arenât the words of a man; those are the words of a child pretending to be a man.â The senatorâs evocation of âa locker roomâ could be an allusion to Donald Trump, who as Republican candidate for president in 2016 memorably dismissed as âlocker room talkâ the Access Hollywood tape, hot-mic audio in which he described kissing and grabbing women â even by the genitals â without their consent. But it isnât. Hawley does not mention Trump even once in his new book, Manhood: The Masculine Virtues America Needs. The book will be published in the US next week. The Guardian obtained a copy. The Guardian contacted Hawley for comment, asking if his criticism of Tate could and should be applied to Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination. No reply was forthcoming. Tate was arrested in Romania in December, on charges of organised crime, rape and human trafficking. Hawley has been viewed as a possible contender for the Republican nomination in 2024 but has said he will not run. He has also dismissed rumours that Trump, who enjoys clear leads in polling despite deepening legal jeopardy on a number of fronts, would pick him as his running mate. âNobody wants to be vice-president,â Hawley said. But Hawley has also said, in what the Washington Post said was close to an endorsement: âTrump is going to be the nominee, I think itâs inevitable. After what Alvin Bragg did, I think that Donald Trump is absolutely going to be the nominee, and yeah, Iâll support him.â Alvin Bragg is the Manhattan district attorney who last month charged Trump with 34 felony counts related to his hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, a porn star, regarding her claims of a sexual affair. Trump denies the affair but spent $130,000 to quieten Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. In his new book, in which Trump is conspicuous by his absence, Hawley dwells at length on pornography and its deleterious influence over modern American men. Trump has been married three times, has frequently bragged about his sexual conquests and has seen his infidelity widely documented by tabloid media. In 2019, Barry Levine and Monique el-Faizy published a book on the subject, All the Presidentâs Women. More than 20 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct or assault. He denies all wrongdoing but one civil case is now at trial in New York. E Jean Carroll, a former magazine columnist, alleges that Trump raped her in a New York department store changing room in the mid-1990s. In video of Trumpâs deposition released to the public last week, Trump was asked about the Access Hollywood tape and his claim to be able to grab women âby the pussyâ because, as a star, he could âdo anythingâ. Trump said: âWell historically, thatâs true with stars.â He was asked: âItâs true you can grab them by the pussy?â He said: âWell, if you look over the last million years, I guess thatâs been largely true. Not always, but largely true. Unfortunately or fortunately.â âYou consider yourself a star?â âI think you can say that, yeah.â Trump was also asked if he had seen other women while married to his first wife, Ivana Trump. He answered: âI donât know.â Trumpâs affair with Marla Maples, who eventually became his second wife and to whom he was married at the time of the alleged attack on Carroll, was a tabloid staple in the 1980s. One famous New York tabloid headline, engineered by Trump, saw Maples proclaim him the provider of the âBest Sex Iâve Ever Hadâ. In his new book about Manhood, writing about Andrew Tate, Hawley condemns an âidea of success [that] apparently involved sleeping with as many women as possible, berating them, abusing them and celebrating it all as manly, as âfreedomââ. The senator, who has said he will support Trump for president, adds: âEvery man who has been in a locker room recognises the type.

1,"Staffordshire ceramic dog statues, once a common sight on Victorian mantelpieces, are experiencing a resurgence in popularity, particularly among a new generation. Vintage marketplace Vinterior has reported a 115% increase in searches for these statues compared to the previous year. The dogs sold out quickly at a recent pop-up store, indicating the growing demand. The appeal lies in their kitschy and whimsical appearance, appealing to both collectors and younger generations looking to add humor and character to their homes. The trend has caused prices to rise, and buyers are advised to look for distinctive features that distinguish high-quality pieces.","Pairs of Staffordshire ceramic dogs, once commonplace on Victorian mantelpieces, are having a sudden resurgence with a boom in demand from a new generation. The vintage marketplace Vinterior reports that searches for Staffordshire dog statues is up 115% year-on-year. When Vinterior launched a recent pop-up store in Londonâs Selfridges, it was the dogs not the Danish dining chairs that were the first items to sell out. The antiques specialist, John Howard, is somewhat surprised but thrilled to see the Victoriana look back in vogue. âThe market changed significantly around 10 years ago with the end of the Laura Ashley era. But now we are seeing demand for more kitsch pieces again. Itâs a bit of a cool in-joke to have a pair,â he said. The original inspiration for the ceramic animals is said to have been Queen Victoriaâs beloved Kings Charles spaniel Dash. Howard says the best quality Staffordshire dog statues were made by small potteries in Staffordshire from 1845 to 1870. Fashioned from press-moulded earthenware, they were hand-painted and many were given glass eyes. From the 1900s onwards they were mass-produced and the quality dropped. However, they are not necessarily âfakeâ: many were made using original moulds, but the detailing is more blurred. Lucy Ward, Vinteriorâs brand director, said there were two distinct groups buying the dogs â collectors with a long-term passion and the younger Instagram and TikTok generation. She explains the latter love the dogsâ playful and whimsical appearance and want to inject a touch of humour to their homes. The architect and interior designer Ben Pentreath falls into the former camp. He bought his first pair more than 15 years ago from a junk shop in Dorchester. They sit proudly on his mantelpiece at home in Dorset, while eight other pairs and six singles are peppered around the house. Until recently, the standard hallmarks of a millennial home have veered towards the minimal. Think grey walls, a potted fiddle-leaf fig and the ultimate influencer signifier â a bum/boob-shaped vase. The Wall Street Journal described it as âa colourless existenceâ. But maybe now Scandi is out, chintz is in. Describing the four-legged knick-knackâs comeback as âcyclicalâ, Pentreath said: âEveryone went mad for them in the late 60s and early 70s, when the whole world went into full on Victoriana-mode. That all went into the bin in the 80s and 90s along with Morris &amp; Co fabrics and seagrass carpets. Just for now, all that is back in taste.â He compares it to the 1970s when âeveryone freaked out about imminent global collapse. Nothing is more reassuring than a pair of dogs smiling at you happily from your mantlepiece as if to say it will all be OK in the end.â This naff-to-nostalgic trend is having a knock-on effect on prices. Howard says that before, a standard pair dating from the 1880s could easily be picked up for Â£120. Listings online now average about Â£400. Pentreath said he had also come across more fakes with âno air holes in the base, and not quite authentic weathering, chips and dingsâ. When it comes to choosing between different genuine versions, Howard said, âthe better ones have certain features that distinguish them from the mundaneâ. He suggested searching for âa front leg that is separately moulded, a curly tail and a defined nose with some George Michael-esque stubbleâ. One of his customers, a former rock star, has more than 300 pairs but only buys pairs with pink noses. âI always say look at the face. Itâs like looking at a bloke. Pick one you like. Youâre going to be staring at it for a long time.â",Guardian,5/05/2023, Staffordshire dog statues back in vogue with TikTok generation,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/05/staffordshire-dog-statues-back-in-vogue-with-tiktok-generation
2,"A court trial has revealed that two men died in a car crash orchestrated as part of a murder plot to silence one of the victims from exposing his affair with a married woman. Saqib Hussain and Mohammed Hashim Ijazuddin were pursued by two vehicles at high speeds before their car hit a tree and burst into flames. Prosecutors presented WhatsApp messages suggesting that the woman's daughter, a TikTok influencer, had threatened to harm Hussain. The woman and her daughter, along with six other defendants, are on trial, charged with murder. The defendants deny the charges. The trial is ongoing.","Two men died in a fireball when their car was driven off the road in a murder plot devised to silence one of the victims from revealing his affair with a married woman, a court has heard. Saqib Hussain, 21, and childhood friend Mohammed Hashim Ijazuddin, 21, were killed on 11 February 2022 when their car hit a tree as they were being pursued by two vehicles at speeds approaching 100mph. One of the vehicles contained Ansreen Bukhari, 45, who had had an on-off affair with Hussain for about three years and recently decided to call it off, jurors were told. WhatsApp messages show her daughter, 23-year-old TikTok influencer Mahek Bukhari, known as Maya, told her mother: âIâll get him jumped by guys, and he wonât know what day it is.â Prosecutor Collingwood Thompson KC said Hussain âcould not acceptâ the elder Bukhariâs decision and had started to blackmail her, threatening to tell her husband and sons about their relationship, and publish sexually explicit videos and photographs. The mother and daughter, from Stoke-on-Trent, are on trial with six other defendants accused of luring Hussain and his friend to a Tesco car park on the outskirts of Leicester before pursuing them at speed and ramming their car off the road. The couple are charged with murder alongside Natasha Akhtar, 22, Raees Jamal, 22, Rekan Karwan, 28, Mohammed Patel, 20, Sanaf Gulammustafa, 22, and Ammeer Jamal, 27. All eight defendants deny two counts of murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter. At the prosecution opening at Leicester crown court on Monday, jurors were played the 999 call Hussain made shortly before his crash, where he could be heard saying: âIâm being followed by two vehicles. Theyâre trying to block me in. âTheyâve got balaclavas on. Theyâre trying to ram me off the road. Theyâre trying to kill me. Iâm going to die.â Their vehicle split in two and was consumed in a fireball when it hit a tree on the A46 outside Leicester, and it was this 999 call which alerted police to the fact it was ânot a tragic accident,â Thompson said. âTheir investigation revealed a story of love, obsession, extortion and ultimately cold-blooded murder,â he added. Thompson said Hussain, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, had told a number of friends about his relationship with Bukhari and said that he loved her, although the pair would often get into arguments and stop communicating for periods of time. When she ended the relationship in January 2022, Hussain became âincreasingly obsessive, professing his love for her and begging her to continue the relationship,â Thompson said. The court heard how he began blackmailing her with sexually explicit photos and videos, and demanding back the Â£3,000 he claimed he had spent on her over the course of the relationship, but Bukhari was reluctant to call the police fearing it would lead to her husband finding out about the affair. âHad she done that we would not be in this court trying allegations of murder,â Thompson said. Instead she confided in her daughter, Marek, who at the time had about 230,000 followers on TikTok. The prosecution claimed she was essential in recruiting Karwan and the other defendants who caused the crash. Thompson said they âset a trapâ for Hussain where they planned to seize his phone containing the incriminating photos and videos. âBut even doing that he could send a message to Ansreen Bukhariâs husband, which would ruin Ansreenâs marriage and damage her reputation. Further, Mahek Bukhari was an influencer on social media and the revelation of that affair might even have caused damage to her standing,â Thompson told the court.

3,"TikTok is reportedly profiting from the sale of illegal and potentially hazardous beauty products, including counterfeit cosmetics and prescription-only skin creams. Despite claiming a ""zero tolerance"" approach to rogue sellers, counterfeit versions of popular brands such as Dior, Vaseline, and Maybelline are being promoted on TikTok's in-app marketplace. Products containing banned ingredients and prescription-only medications are openly advertised as well. Analysis indicates that TikTok's rules on prohibited items are not effectively enforced, with illicit beauty products frequently promoted to users. The prevalence of counterfeits raises concerns about safety and consumer protection.","TikTok is profiting from the sale of illegal and potentially dangerous beauty products, including counterfeit cosmetics and prescription-only skin creams, despite claiming to take a âzero toleranceâ approach to rogue sellers. Counterfeit versions of Dior perfumes, Vaseline lip balms and Maybelline mascaras are among products being touted by third-party vendors via TikTokâs in-app marketplace. Skin-whitening lotions containing banned ingredients and potent acne creams that should only be supplied with a prescription were also being openly advertised last week. The products are being sold via TikTok Shop, an in-app shopping feature which allows users to buy products they see promoted by influencers and brands. There is also a âshopâ tab where users can browse products, from cosmetics and clothing to toilet rolls and sports drinks. Since launching in 2021, the feature has helped turn TikTok into a destination for online retail, with a recent poll by market research firm Savanta finding that UK respondents under 26 used it to make 19 purchases per year â more than through Instagram or Facebook. TikTok, which takes 5% commission on sales, says it has strict rules on what can be sold via TikTok Shop, including prohibiting âthe advertising and saleâ of all counterfeit products. It also bans the sale of prescription-only medicines, such as the acne skin cream, and of skin-whitening creams that contain banned ingredients. âBy ensuring the safety and authenticity of products sold on our platform, we create a positive shopping experience that users can have confidence in,â the policy adds. But analysis suggests the rules are not being effectively enforced, with illicit beauty products routinely being promoted to users via their content feeds and search results. Last week, nine out of the first 12 results shown to people searching âperfumeâ in the TikTok Shop section of the app appeared to be counterfeit. The products included variations of Diorâs Sauvage perfume, with names such as âSuaveâ and âSavageâ, and a copy of Viktor and Rolfâs Flowerbomb perfume, which looks the same at first glance but was actually called âMark and Victorâ. Searches for mascara and other makeup items also led to recommendations for products that appeared to be fake. In some cases, the items remained live on the marketplace even when they were explicitly labelled as âdupesâ. The prevalence of counterfeits has led to warnings from some TikTok Shop customers. A UK-based woman who bought a Â£25 beauty gift bag said she was âfumingâ after being sent a single lip gloss that was clearly a counterfeit. âBe careful who you order from on TikTok Shop,â she said in a video. âPlease check your sellers because thereâs so many fakes going around. Itâs not worth the loss of money. I canât even get hold of the company and funnily enough theyâve now got nothing on their shop.â Another TikTok Shop customer said she was sent a poor-quality perfume that âliterally smells like nail varnishâ after ordering from what she thought was a reputable seller on TikTok. She messaged the seller to ask for a refund but was told that because the item had been opened it couldnât be returned. In a video for followers she added: âIf you are going to buy this perfume please check out the shops youâre buying it from and avoid these guys. I lost out on my money.â Health and consumer experts say the products are unlikely to have undergone safety testing in line with UK standards and contain unknown, potentially toxic ingredients. Many of the illicit products sold via TikTok Shop are made in China and shipped to the UK, according to TikTokâs listings data, with details about their origin and manufacturing processes unknown. Tests of seized counterfeit cosmetics by the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit have previously found that many contain âtoxic levelsâ of arsenic, mercury and lead. If something goes wrong, customers are left exposed, Gavin Terry, lead officer for intellectual property at the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said. âIf somebody has a counterfeit product and they put it on their skin and have an allergic reaction, theyâll go to the brand. And thatâs one way these horror stories develop. The brand will say, âThatâs not my productâ. Thereâs no quality control and no guarantee theyâre safe.â Terry added that there had been an increase in the sale of counterfeits on social media in recent years, with endorsements from influencers driving demand. âThe influencers are the soft face of it. Behind that thereâs a criminal organisation. And the social media platform is an intermediary â they create the conduit,â he said. In 2021, a report for the Intellectual Property Office found that the role of influencers was key to affecting consumer purchases of counterfeit products. Of 1,000 women aged 16 to 60 who were surveyed, 13% said they had been prompted by social media endorsements to buy counterfeit products. In addition to the fake products, prescription-only gels containing tretinoin, which is used for the treatment of acne, were available to buy through TikTok Shop last week. Tretinoin can lead to interactions with other medications and cause foetal abnormalities if taken while pregnant so must be used with medical supervision. Dr Jane Ravenscroft, of the British Association of Dermatologists, said the illicit sale of skin creams was a âmajor concernâ and a âpublic health riskâ. âUnfortunately, people selling these prescription products illegally are preying on peopleâs insecurities and naivety. Social media adds fuel to the fire,â she said. TikTok blocked searches for âtretinoinâ and removed listings from third-party vendors that referred to the ingredient after being alerted by the Observer. Selling prescription-only drugs without a prescription is a criminal offence. Listings for skin-whitening creams containing the banned ingredient hydroquinone were also removed. TikTok said it took intellectual property infringement and the illicit sale of medical products seriously, and that those breaking the rules could be banned from the platform. It said it had removed hundreds of products and merchants from TikTok Shop so far this year, including around 50 listings flagged by the Observer. In 2022, it launched an Intellectual Property Protection Centre, a tool it said would help brands identify product listings that breach their IP.",Guardian,23/04/2023,TikTok cashing in on sale of counterfeit cosmetics and prescription skin creams,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/23/tiktok-cashing-in-counterfeit-beauty-products-skin-gels
4,"According to Internet 2.0, the cybersecurity company that previously exposed TikTok's data collection practices, the social media company has expanded its collection of location information to include altitude data. This new capability could potentially reveal the floor level of a user inside a building. TikTok had previously been criticized for collecting extensive data, including contact lists and calendars, but dismissed the concerns as baseless. Internet 2.0 stated that TikTok has never directly addressed the issues raised in their report, and the director of the company expressed distrust towards TikTok's behavior and lack of transparency. TikTok denied the claim, stating that GPS data is not collected in Australia. The Senate committee hearing on foreign influence on social media is ongoing.","The Australian-US cybersecurity company that last year revealed the extent of TikTokâs data collection says the social media company has increased what location information it collects to include altitude, which could tell it what floor of a building a user is on. Last year Internet 2.0 released a study on the data TikTok attempts to collect on user devices, which includes contact lists and calendars, and its scanning of hard drives and geolocating devices on an hourly basis. At the time TikTok described the report as âbaselessâ and said it was no different to the data other social media apps seek. After the report a number of western countries, including Australia, banned the app from government-issued devices amid fears about whether the Chinese government could access data under national security law. The director of Internet 2.0, David Robinson, on Thursday told a Senate committee hearing on foreign influence on social media that TikTok had never directly addressed the issues his firm had raised in the report. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup â[TikTok] have never come back to us and argued the points about the data and their source code,â he said. âSo itâs their word against the source code. âTheyâve called us names. They said we donât understand what the code is. But theyâve never come back and qualified or quantify their position.â He said the company had undertaken another analysis of the updated source code and discovered that in addition to latitude and longitude data from a userâs device, the app was now seeking altitude information. âSo if youâre in a high-rise building, they can tell what floor youâre on now,â Robinson said. âAnd that wasnât previously in their code last year.â A spokesperson for TikTok rejected the claim, saying GPS data was not collected in Australia, and only collected overseas where users enabled it. âWe do not collect GPS location data from users in Australia, nor do we seek permission for this,â they said. âTo clarify, in other regions where a user has enabled and grants access to location services, TikTok collects this information based on device GPS data.â The spokesperson said Internet 2.0 admits their analysis is ânot conclusive and doesnât include a detailed source code review, which they admit is the best way to assess data collection practicesâ. âWhatâs been presented are misleading, inconsistent results based on a flawed and biased analysis that lacked any real depth.â Robinson said with other apps where Internet 2.0 had analysed the source code â such as with Telegram and Proton â the companies explained their code or provided more evidence as to what the code does. He said TikTok had never approached it that way. âNo oneâs perfect,â he said. âBut to be honest about it, and go, âYes, weâve had an issue. We didnât know about it, weâre checking it, weâre fixing itâ â thatâs normal behaviour, thatâs trustworthy behaviour, in our opinion. âBut to call us names and basically never, never, never show your code and explain it makes me not trust them.â The hearing continues on Friday.",Guardian,20/04/2023,"TikTok data collection could reveal what floor a user is on, cybersecurity firm says",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/21/tiktok-data-collection-could-reveal-what-floor-a-user-is-on-cybersecurity-firm-says
5,"TikTok may face a ban in the United States unless it divests itself from Chinese ownership, according to Brendan Carr, a commissioner of the US Federal Communications Commission. Concerns over surveillance and national security have prompted calls for a ban, with several countries already prohibiting TikTok's use on government devices. TikTok has taken measures to address these concerns, including moving US user data to domestic servers and allowing scrutiny of its source code. However, Carr insists that only a complete ban or severing ties with China would be acceptable.","TikTok will either need to divest itself from Chinese ownership or face a ban in the United States, according to the commissioner of the US federal communications commission, Brendan Carr, who accused the company of âgaslightingâ the public on surveillance concerns. Appearing before the Australian Senate inquiry into foreign influence through social media, the Trump appointee said concern about TikTok in the US was âbroad and deepâ, and crossed party lines. Following the United Kingdom, Australia and other countriesâ ban of the app from government devices, the US is considering a full ban nationally. Legislation enacting a statewide ban was recently passed in Montana. TikTok has attempted to head off any potential ban by moving US user data to third-party servers within the country. It is also allowing its source code to be scrutinised by US tech firm Oracle, which will screen TikTok app updates. Carr told the committee while that was ultimately an issue being handled by the US Treasury department, there was a common view among Democrats and Republicans that the data could not be prevented from being accessed by Chinese government officials under the 2017 national security law. Carr, the most senior Republican member on the FCC, said only an outright ban of the app in the United States or removing all corporate ties to China would be acceptable. âUltimately, I think some sort of â¦ legislation that imposes a ban or a genuine divestiture is the way forward right now,â he said. âThe argument that somehow TikTok is going to stand up to the CCP is belied by their inability to do it at any point in time publicly. For instance, when asked in US media interviews, whether they acknowledge the existence of the Uyghur genocide, their official on TV refused to address it.â Carr said that a Project Texas plan might work for other Chinese companies, but TikTokâs actions to date meant there was no trust for the United States. âWeâve had this years-long approach that strikes me is nothing short of a gaslighting in terms of their misrepresentations,â he said. A spokesperson for TikTok said divestment wouldnât solve the problem if national security is the objective. âA change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access. The best way to address concerns about national security is with the transparent, US-based protection of US user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification, which we are already implementing.â The Australian government has announced no plans beyond the ban of TikTok from government devices, but the Coalition is likely to push the Labor government for more restrictions on the app. The chair of the inquiry and shadow home affairs minister, senator James Paterson, opened the hearing by saying that the inquiry would serve as a starting point on making Australians a harder target for foreign interference. âWe cannot allow foreign authoritarian regimes to have unfettered access to the devices of millions of Australians and the powerful opportunity that offers them to influence our democracy,â he said. âThe work starts today to make us a harder target against the threat of cyber enabled foreign interference.â TikTok this week issued a factcheck on claims made about the app, and denied that Australian user data could be accessed in China. The inquiry is holding initial hearings on Thursday and Friday, and is due to report back to parliament in August.",Guardian,20/04/2023,"TikTok must divest itself of Chinese ownership or face ban, FCC commissioner tells Australian inquiry",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/20/tiktok-must-divest-itself-of-chinese-ownership-or-face-ban-fcc-commissioner-tells-australian-inquiry
6,"TikTok Australia published a factcheck in response to concerns over Chinese ownership, its headquarters, content manipulation, censorship, and data sharing. The factcheck downplayed Chinese ownership by stating that only 20% of its parent company, ByteDance, is owned by its founder, ignoring other significant Chinese ownership. It claimed not to be headquartered in China, despite previous statements referring to ByteDance as a ""Chinese-headquartered"" company. TikTok denied content manipulation and censorship allegations, but leaked documents revealed censorship instructions. While TikTok claimed user data is protected under local laws, a Department of Homeland Security report suggests Chinese laws could still apply. The factcheck acknowledged that data collection practices are not unique to TikTok, potentially undermining the effectiveness of government bans on the app.","The Chinese social media app TikTok has been under fire recently. The Australian government announced a ban of the app on government-owned devices earlier this month. The ban has been implemented at a government level in other western countries including the US, the UK, New Zealand, Canada and France. On Monday, TikTok Australia published a self-described factcheck, titled The Truth About TikTok: Separating Fact from Fiction, on TikTokâs site and on LinkedIn. However, the report, Myth vs fact, did not tell the full story. We decided to take a close look at some of the companyâs claims. On Chinese ownership The factcheck labels it a âmythâ that âTikTokâs parent company, ByteDance Ltd, is Chinese ownedâ. In an attempt to downplay Chinese ownership, it says roughly 60% of its parent company, ByteDance, is owned by global institutional investors. The remainder is made up of employees across the globe (20%), as well as the companyâs founder (20%), who TikTok describes as âa private individual and not part of any state or government entityâ. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But this confirms that at least 20% and likely much more of the company is, in fact, Chinese-owned. A submission to Australiaâs parliamentary inquiry on foreign influence through social media claimed that the companyâs founder, Zhang Yiming, âhas links to provincial united front organisations in Fujianâ. The CCPâs united front is a Chinese government organisation that works to advance the partyâs interests â particularly abroad. TikTok has dismissed the research paper that formed the basis of the submission. On being headquartered in China The factcheck also labelled it a âmythâ that âTikTok and ByteDance are headquartered in Chinaâ, saying âByteDance does not have a single global headquartersâ. ByteDance is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, but in the companyâs appeal against the US official divestment order in 2020, ByteDance repeatedly described itself as a âChinese-headquarteredâ company. The âmanipulationâ of content TikTok claims it does not â[manipulate] content in a way that benefits the Chinese government or harms Australian interestsâ. The factcheck says the company âdoes not permit any government to influence or change its recommendation modelâ and that users can âfind a variety of content and views expressed about certain political issues or events, including those which are critical of the Chinese governmentâ. It is difficult to verify these claims because the TikTok algorithm that governs what users see on their âFor Youâ page is secret. After the TikTok chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, appeared before US Congress earlier this year some users reported they began seeing pro-Chew videos in their feed, but TikTok denied the suggestion it was deliberating serving users pro-TikTok content and others said it was more likely a result of the appâs algorithm responding to users having pro-TikTok feelings. On censorship The company claimed it does not censor âTikTok content on behalf of the CCP or Chinese governmentâ. But leaked moderator documents obtained in 2019 by the Guardian revealed TikTok had instructed its moderators to censor videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong. TikTok argued at the time that the documents were outdated. National intelligence law TikTok labelled it a âmythâ that âunder its 2017 National Intelligence law, the Chinese government can compel ByteDance to share Australian TikTok user dataâ. TikTok claims that Australian TikTok user data is stored in Singapore, Malaysia and the US, and is âsubject to local lawsâ, arguing this would protect the China law being applied outside China. However, a Department of Homeland Security report argues the law can be applied to data held domestically in China or abroad. Data collection At least one of the claims in TikTokâs factcheck is well supported by the available evidence: that the app itself is ânot unique in the amount of information it collectsâ. Social media companies of all stripes collect and share user data, a practice they defend as typical across the industry. As Guardian Australia reported last week, the ban on government employees downloading the TikTok app to their work devices may be rendered ineffective due to these data-sharing practices.",Guardian,18/04/2023,TikTok Australia has launched a factcheck on itself.

7,"The rise of TikTok's food content, characterized by bizarre and outrageous recipe hacks, has garnered attention and controversy. From ironed toasties to Doritos-filled tacos, creators on the platform experiment with unconventional food combinations that often elicit strong reactions. While some creators intentionally provoke viewers for attention and engagement, others embrace the shock value to entertain and amuse. With views and shares driving monetization opportunities, these viral food videos offer a mix of fascination, disgust, and even possible fetishistic appeal. However, amidst the chaos, there is still a place for more traditional and practical recipes on TikTok, albeit often overshadowed by the attention-grabbing content.","I have just ironed my husband a toasted sandwich like some kind of tradwife and to be honest, Iâm disappointed with his reaction. Admittedly, there were a few issues. The steam didnât help, plus I wrapped it in too much tinfoil, so the heat couldnât penetrate. The main problem, though, was that holding an iron meant I automatically started ironing the package, pressing hard and going to and fro industriously. The result is flat, very flat. âWe have a sandwich toaster,â my husband points out, holding the crepe-thin delicacy between finger and thumb. He should be thrilled: this is the closest Iâve come to cooking for him in months. He tries it, reluctantly. âItâs very soft. Did you put mustard in it?â âI thought it would help,â I say. âIt doesnât.â Unless you are a particularly online person, you are probably asking why, at this point. Itâs a question I have asked myself repeatedly, in a rising pitch of incredulity and distress as I dived deep into TikTok food â or FoodTok, if you will. Because that is where the ironed toastie comes from: itâs part of a new generation of TikTok recipe hacks that embody a provocative, frankly deranged âwhy not?â philosophy. Weâve come a long, wrong way since 2021âs viral feta pasta. Now, in addition to ironed toasties, you can enjoy a beatifically smiling blonde putting dried pasta in a blender to create an approximation of flour, then adding an egg to create a sort of dough. She then fashions lumpy, fat noodles, which she boils, tops with tomato sauce and declares âexactly like fresh pastaâ. Comments include the likes of âYOU VIOLATED THE PASTAâ, âMaâam, blink twice if someone is holding you hostageâ and many irate Italians. But that is not even as bad as the unholy tacos made by boiling beef, eggs and cheese in a bag of Doritos. Thereâs a whole genre of sponsored-by-diabetes content, where beautiful, young, slim women combine terrifying quantities of marshmallows, sweets, chocolate, butter, cereal, preprepared cookie dough and the like into âincredibleâ desserts that should be illegal. Many videos are titled: âWhy am I just finding out about â¦â to which the answer is surely: âBecause it should be on trial at The Hague.â You can watch people boil up crisps to make mashed potato, or dump uncooked dried pasta in the oven covered in a house-brick sized portion of cream cheese and a jar of sauce. Dry packet ramen oven-baked in tomato sauce and cheese is called âpizzaâ (I worry for Italyâs collective blood pressure). How about marinading chicken in the sink, or massaging mountains of mac and cheese on a worktop? âEverybodyâs so creative!â TikToker @Tanaradoublechocolate, who seeks out culinary atrocities to comment upon, says. At the risk of sounding like Grampa Simpson yelling at clouds â which is exactly how I feel exploring FoodTok â what is going on? âThereâs a long and storied history of gross-out food on social media,â says Chris Stokel-Walker, social media expert and the author of TikTok Boom. Twisted, the social media food brand that just announced a collaboration with Iceland, started out in 2016 and dared us to make the likes of deep-fried barbecue chicken-stuffed pizzadilla. Now, says Stokel-Walker, âItâs been supercharged by the arrival of TikTok.â The app is designed and engineered to âcapture peopleâs attention as they are scrolling through that endless feed of contentâ and one good way to do it is precisely âthe outlandish, the gross-outâ. It is a notion echoed by Jonah Berger, professor at the Wharton school in Pennsylvania and bestselling author of Contagious, a study of social transmission and virality, who notes that these videos combine surprise and often disgust. âThe more surprising something is, the more likely we are to share it with others. And disgust is a high arousal emotion that also causes us to pass things on.â So is this content engineered to provoke? Some of it, definitely. âI never work to appear genuine,â says Eli Betchik of @elis_kitchen, the self-proclaimed âmost evil chef on TikTokâ. âIf anyone asks, I say: âYeah, I do this for attention.â I think itâs pretty obvious I do.â It is a mark of Betchikâs evil genius that every video of theirs makes me shout âNo!â in genuine anger at some point. Betchik was behind the much-reviled potato crisp mash, and a horrifying sandwich made of blended peas, pineapple, cheese and nuts, with the bread coated with mayo, then fried, among other outrages. Betchik is a fine art jeweller, who started their channel after discovering TikTok at jewellery school. âI thought, I already love experimenting with food and trying new things â I could probably take that a few steps further and use it for some good old-fashioned shock-value entertainment.â Their first video was fried mayonnaise. I make a strangled noise hearing this. âYeah, it was horrible,â confirms Betchik. Another early favourite was meatballs boiled in lime juice âuntil the juice was a thick syrup. Iâm salivating because I can still taste the sourness. It was the most violent flavour Iâve ever had.â Outrage is the point, and, Betchik says, people enjoy feeling it. âObviously, what Iâm doing is to gross people out, but people keep coming back â they wouldnât keep coming back if they didnât get something out of it. I find that sometimes people get happy when theyâre upset in the right way.â On their jewellery TikTok account @eli_metal, Betchik says, a mean comment would take days to digest, but with the food, itâs a mark of success. The one comment they wonât accept is that these horrendous creations are wasteful: impressively, worryingly omnivorous, Betchik finishes almost everything. In addition, âI try to use foods that are close to going bad or things that have been donated to me. And if I canât eat it, I compost all the scraps.â Itâs not clear if this level of diligence is common practice among the creators, but it feels doubtful. Mean commenters on the @myjanebrain TikTok account include a certain Gordon Ramsay, who angrily described a chicken stuffed in a pumpkin, garnished with cinnamon sticks and many onions as âHalloween salmonella right there.â âIt was pretty awesome,â says Jane, a preternaturally cheery 27-year-old Canadian and full-time content creator who prefers not to give her surname, perhaps for fear of reprisals from Italians angered by her ramen âpizzaâ. âBut I know the chicken was fully cooked. It was moist, it had great flavour.â Jane ended up in the realm of what is sometimes called ârage-baitâ cooking accidentally. Her early videos, she says, were straight instructional content, but she pivoted when her fried chicken recipe went viral. âIt got 31m views, 3,000 comments,â says Jane â this is, of course, highly populated TikTok territory, the hashtag #FoodTikTok had accumulated 112bn views by the end of 2022, for example. âI thought it would be positive but it was more like: âYouâre the worst chef Iâve ever seen.â So I realised that I would have no idea what people were going to think of my videos.â She started focusing on finding the âcraziest combinationsâ, including one titled âI learned this hotdog trick in Englandâ, in which she makes jelly from pickle juice, adds frankfurters and eats it in a bread bun. âThat is absolutely not English,â I challenge her hotly, TikTok commenter style. âI canât remember; it was from some sort of British something,â she says. âI was going to ask you why you make pickle juice jelly!â What makes people angriest, though, she says, is her cooking techniques. âAs soon as you cook for the internet you open yourself up to all the critics who are so specific in the way they cook.â Both Jane and Eli are clear that their content is knowingly provocative rather than instructional, whether viewers understand that or not. âA lot of people take this content at face value when you have to remember weâre through the looking-glass on social media, where these things are being deliberately gamed for the benefit of those that create it,â says Stokel-Walker. All attention is good attention, since views and shares â including the genre of angry or incredulous âduetâ videos where other creators (including Ramsay) comment on their depravity â are the point. Thatâs how you make money after all: successful TikTokers can become part of the appâs creator fund and get paid â admittedly pennies â per view. Stokel-Walker says that success can allow creators to pivot to the kind of genuinely lucrative mainstream collaborations that Twisted has managed. There is another possibly upsetting angle: fetish. âVideos where they point a lot and touch things and make super-repulsive stuff are apparently fetish,â a baker friend tells me airily, when I inquire if she uses TikTok recipes. It turns out thereâs a fairly widespread suspicion this is a thing. The messier foods could fulfil a âsploshingâ fetish: getting sexual gratification from food mess. âIâve seen this aired,â says Stokel-Walker. âCertainly, it appeals to your senses. Itâs like a slow-motion car crash in food form, where youâre like, how more disgusting can this get?â TikTok user @lenarae.lh analyses food videos and pronounces them fetish or non-fetish on the basis of how the women â it is almost always women â use their hands, splash or squirt stuff suggestively or massage phallic things. A friend also directs me to the work of a creator called @cedriklorenzen who specialises in whacking pieces of raw meat, dribbling, drizzling and taking his top off. Itâs a better appetite suppressant than Ozempic: after watching, I never want to eat, have sex, or indeed see anything again. There is actually plenty of good, normal food on TikTok. Asking around, people mention recipes for homemade crispy chilli sauce, broccoli pasta, sesame dip and various noodle dishes theyâve tried, then added to their repertoire. Seema Pankhania, a 25-year-old former chef de partie at Gordon Ramsayâs Lucky Cat who posts as @seemagetsbaked, has 1.3 million followers for her eminently achievable, delicious-looking recipes. They are pleasingly lo-fi, especially her pyjama recipes for hungover, no bones days and ultra simple versions of Indian classics â her butter chicken has 1.7m likes (she also recommends her âsuper simple creamy chicken curryâ. But even Pankhania, a proper cook, is aware it is all grist to the gnatâs attention span TikTok mill. She aims to keep videos under a minute long (âthe shorter the better; people are going to get boredâ) and has no illusions that much of the food content is only meant to be consumed with the eyes. âThereâs a whole other field of cooking on TikTok which is indulgent,â she says, giving the example of elaborate lasagnes. âNobody is going to make it, but itâs very nice and satisfying to watch.â Clearly that goes for the bizarre and the gross-out stuff too in some more depraved way. âAt the end of the day, social media is entertainment, right?â says Pankhania. âMost of it is just for entertainment and people arenât actually going to be cooking a lot of it.â Given much of food TikTok isnât meant to be cooked, or is intentionally tongue in cheek, Iâm sure Iâm missing the point entirely as I cram half a packet of spaghetti into my blender. A flimsy thing, it protests loudly with an ominous smell of burning rubber. I whiz up vermicelli instead, dump the âflourâ on the worktop and add an egg, making a claggy mess. I have to add normal flour â surely invalidating the whole madness â to form a dough ball capable of being rolled out. The resultant approximate noodles are dumped in boiling water. I take them out based on vibes alone â TikTok recipes are wildly unspecific â then my family gather to taste and criticise. My husband â whose former student staple of peas and camembert prepared in a kettle would be a runaway TikTok hit â declares it raw. âItâs not terrible,â one son ventures. âItâs not good either,â says the other, correctly. I dare not attempt anything of Betchikâs, and Jane recommends her own recipe for cinnamon buns baked in cream and coffee, topped with sugar, butter and flattened toffees â but I am 48 and my organs will explode if I eat that. My wimpâs version â a vegan bun sliced and covered in oat cream, sugar and cinnamon â comes out of the oven ominously black; my just deserts for messing with the recipe, I suppose. I eat it all anyway â itâs a cinnamon bun and cream, whatâs not to like? â then, exhausted and hyperglycaemic, I close TikTok, hopefully for good. Everybodyâs so creative! I wish they werenât.",Guardian,18/04/2023,"The disgusting food of TikTok: is it designed to eat, provoke â or arouse?",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/18/the-disgusting-food-of-tiktok-is-it-designed-to-eat-provoke-or-arouse
8,"Inflation and rising food prices in the UK have led to a surge in TikTok videos focusing on grocery shopping and budgeting. Users film their supermarket trips, sharing the cost of their groceries and offering money-saving tips. The videos provide a glimpse into the reality of grocery shopping and the impact of rising prices, challenging the notion of average spending figures. TikTok has become a platform for open conversations about the cost of living, offering viewers insight into different shopping strategies. However, TikTok creators note that the platform doesn't provide significant financial benefits for their content.","Before Rachel Nixon goes to the supermarket, she sketches a quick shopping list in her head. In the garage she usually has a sack of potatoes, and meat, green veg and bread in the freezer. For the bits in between, she will head either to her local, membership-only brand discounter, the Company Shop in Barnsley, or to a mainstream supermarket such as Aldi. âToday Iâm going with a Â£50 budget to feed five of us â Â£10 a day, Â£2 per person per meal. Iâll go home and look at what Iâve got in the freezer, check the rice, pasta. Itâs make do and mend.â Unlike other shoppers, Nixon has a press pass, because when sheâs filling her basket, she will also be filming a TikTok on her phone, and the Company Shop management requires permission. Her content, which âbegan as a jokeâ, follows her around the aisles, scrutinising produce and bargains against the biggest question at any supermarket in 2023: how can this cost this much? At many mainstream shops, Nixon says: âA Â£50 shop is now an Â£80 shop. People in the middle are floundering around.â Inflation is something everyone has noticed â even Cardi B went online to decry the price of American lettuce â but not everyone feels the impact at the checkout. If you are experiencing the pinch, TikTokâs intuitive âFor Youâ page will be a disjointed research trip to the countryâs supermarkets, trailing behind the trolley in the company of total strangers who share information that used to be a stable and private part of our lives â what we spend on food. âCome shopping with me at Lidl.â âRealistic food haul from Aldi.â âÂ£58 shop at M&amp;S.â âFarmFoods underrated gems.â The scroll goes deep into the massive digital gumbo of TikTok, where the simple act of spending and saving money at the supermarket has dug a deep content stream â in global lifetime counts, #shopwithme has amassed 3.9bn views and #costofliving 1.5bn views, according to figures from TikTok, which is owned by the ByteDance company, headquartered in China. With these shoppers, you watch as they pick out a weekly food shop, formulating a guess for the receipt reveal at the end. Youâll hear a soundtrack of trolley rattles and packaging rustling off the shelves as someone youâll never meet explains theyâre not buying gravy this week (thereâs some in the freezer), and they wonât be picking up bread because theyâre gluten-free and Pete who does eat bread is on a work trip. The receipt reveal has become a grimly unpredictable game, since inflation has been repricing foodstuffs at the fastest rate since 1977 and in lurid proportions, particularly for lower-priced items such as pasta, tea and bread. Of course, as Nixon says: âItâs not just food. The cost of gas, electric, breathing â everything has gone up. When will something give? We all have households to run.â The governmentâs official figures saw food inflation rise to 18.2% in the year to January 2023, based on about 200 items in a representative basket. Other bodies such as the Food Foundation use a different basket of goods, and put food inflation higher. Iâve seen TikTokers joke about taking out a mortgage to buy butter, but generally speaking the social undertow of the videos is far from funny. The unwritten template for the #shopwithme videos is based on honesty: whatâs going in the basket and why, and how much it costs. Honesty, but also disbelief. Jayne, a twentysomething teacher, describes her area of Cambridgeshire as relatively affluent, and with two incomes and no dependents in her household, she and her partner can afford a Â£300 monthly food budget, which they direct mostly to M&amp;S Foodhalls. âM&amp;S is quite small, so I get less distracted. Tesco has clothing, candles, I donât think Iâd be as disciplined. I just stick to my list.â This became the focus of her TikTok account, almost entirely a run of her routine supermarket shops at M&amp;S. âThere isnât a place [like TikTok] where people are sharing such an intimate part of their life. Iâve seen videos on what it costs to run a two-bed household in Wiltshire â thereâs a natural curiosity from people, and if youâre willing to share parts of your life, it takes away from the unrealistic glamour of social media. I canât believe how much people are interested in whatâs going into the basket. I never expected the videos to do well,â says Jayne. This curiosity seems to be a consequence of missing information: though the internet may tell us the average person spends about Â£40 a week on food, that doesnât seem right â or to put it another way, it feels as though the average figure is lying to us. When an industrial park can make neighbours of supermarkets that are miles apart in cost and branding, it begins to seem like there is no point to an average figure, when differences between prices are also cultural distances. âIt costs a bomb to live in London,â says Nishat Tahsin, a biotech/bioengineering doctoral student who joined TikTok during lockdown, and now has more than 200,000 followers. Her content is about cooking imaginatively on a budget (think butter chicken puff pastry pie, or Bangladeshi satni citrus salad), but also organising grocery shopping habits. âI never used to have a food budget, but now itâs more expensive to live I always make a plan at the weekend for what Iâm doing during the week. Loads of students prioritise study, then food later. I look at what I have in the freezer, then the costs that would come with it to make a meal.â At the beginning of each term, she bulk buys starches and bakery goods, adding fresh foods along the way in smaller shops, and heading to Asian or African markets for spices by the kilo. âI can do a weekly shop for under Â£20. A whole chicken for Â£3, go splits with flatmates on potatoes and onions, buy bread, cheese, milk, maybe a bit of nutmeg. But thatâs because I buy essentials every few months.â For the freezer, she flat-packs meat portions and fish fillets, and grates up cheese blocks so high-value protein is never wasted. Tahsin isnât like her friends in this regard â she notes how many students have been buying toilet paper on TikTok (bales of 60 rolls for as little as Â£18), and âtheyâre buying things left, right and centre on TikTok Shop. They donât want to spend the time and money at Asda.â TikTok itself has inverted the surface logic of spontaneous buying on the platform by investing in a campaign around its library of money-saving tips. And brands that approach Tahsin also want a part of the problem. âEvery time I do a brand deal they mention their new USP would be combating the cost of living crisis.â Over time, I noticed a lot of people on TikTok name-checking specific brands, and began to wonder if campaign spend was behind it. M&amp;S Foodhalls, for example, is getting traction on a âthis is surprisingly affordableâ theme on #shopwithme TikTok. The brand confirmed all the content is organic and not paid for, but says it has noticed a âhuge surgeâ of it in recent months. Even an official Waitrose TikTok account gamely had a go at joining the Â£20-a-week family shop trend. The question is, does this help anyone? Dr SinÃ©ad Furey is a lecturer in consumer management and food innovation at Ulster University, focused on food insecurity. âThere is no substitute for food,â she says bluntly. âBut we are still talking about not knowing where the next meal comes from. For every one of us who goes to a food bank, there are nine of us who donât. Stigma, pride, whatever. Food insecurity isnât acute; it is chronic.â For her research, she followed a cohort of 60 shoppers and analysed their supermarket habits. âThereâs a huge reliance on shopping lists to frame or curtail your spend,â she says. âThere is nobody better than those in lower-income households at micromanaging budgets. They know the price of a pint of milk across different stores and they know when the yellow stickers go on. It annoys me that thereâs a presumption that lower-income consumers are bad with their money.â Shona Goudie at the Food Foundation leads the organisationâs Basic Basket programme, which has been tracking food prices based on baskets of goods at Tesco, as developed by Loughborough University and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation for male and female archetypal shoppers. âThe government looks at food price inflation but we donât feel it reflects what people are really buying, or the nutrition factor. We started tracking prices a year ago, and itâs increased 22% in that period.â Mitch Lane is a nuts and bolts salesman who lives near Walsall, in the West Midlands. Like Tahsin, he joined TikTok during lockdown, at the request of his daughter: âShe wanted another follower,â he says. âI was mostly doing the dad dances and press-up challenges. But one day I was cooking up a chilli con carne and [the video] went really well. I started to do âfakeawaysâ â how to make your own Nandoâs, burgers. Simple stuff, one-pan meals.â This developed into a budget-conscious series of cookery ideas, under the moniker âMeals by Mitchâ, with the shopping receipt under Â£5 shown first, and the method to follow. âAs the cost of living developed into an absolute joke, I kept seeing budget meals where people drizzled balsamic vinegar from their pantry. I donât have a pantry. I wanted to do everything for a flat fiver.â Lane has picked up 1.2m followers and a book deal, and he is certain that âthe cost of living has propelled itâ. Other TikTokers who share photogenic techniques for prepping breakfast, lunch and dinner into neat ranks of Tupperware boxes or elongating the lifespan of lemons in jars of fridge water have also enjoyed success. But Lane wants to keep things grounded in reality. âIâve lived on a budget most of my life. Itâs not new to me. If I walked into a supermarket with a fiver, I used to get more. The budget meals are getting harder, whether itâs the price per kilo for veggies or the pasta and dried foods. People are finding it tough.â Fraser Reynolds, a personal trainer based near Stirling, Scotland, started filming calorie-minded food TikToks from his motherâs âtiny council house kitchen â no gadgetsâ. This morphed into a recipe series he describes as âthe poor manâs Joe Wicksâ, with a popular stream of â12 meals for 20 quidâ. However, heâs had to rethink this, âbecause I cannot keep it under the price. In the past three months Iâve struggled putting it together because to keep it under Â£20 Iâm going to give you the main ingredients and assume you have the spices already at home.â Though TikTok is worryingly good at distracting attention with dogs pressing doorbells or Wisconsin grandmothers dispensing life wisdom, it is arguably one of the few sources of a public, open conversation about how far money goes across different sections of society. Not what it looks like, aspirationally, but what it looks like literally, with a weekly shop spread out on the kitchen countertop. âIf people are showing the receipts and what theyâve bought, it definitely helps,â Lane says. âItâs good for people to see that if you write a list and stick to the brief, and are not dashing stuff into the trolley, and you base a shop around it, itâs a guaranteed money saver.â Does being on TikTok as a creator bring anything extra to the table? âTikTok â there ainât really any money in it,â Lane says. âWeâre talking such a minimal amount per view. I get Â£150 a month off it, something like that. You couldnât live off it.â Nixon says she receives, as a ârelative minnowâ with 27,000 followers, about 12p a day from TikTok. Meanwhile, Tahsin has been thinking about âselling seasoning for cheaper than a supermarket on TikTok Shopâ. For her, the platform is a creative and relatively kind place. âI get a lot of diversity in my comments. In the UK our generation is really open to trying anything. I get requests for oxtail Jamaican curry, or Turkish kebabs. A lot of British people will want to know how to make samosas. Itâs nice that people are less critical on TikTok. People will eat anything when theyâre hungry.â â¢ This article was amended on 19 April 2023. An earlier version suggested Walsall was in Birmingham.

9,"Labor senator Helen Polley has garnered attention for her unconventional method of cooking hardboiled eggs. In a TikTok video, she demonstrated wrapping a raw egg in aluminum foil, submerging it in water, and microwaving it for six to seven minutes. While putting metal objects in microwaves is generally discouraged, Polley's technique works because metals reflect most of the microwaves away from their surface. The water surrounding the egg-in-foil acts as insulation and aids in cooking the egg. However, there is a risk of explosions when heating whole eggs in microwaves, so caution is advised. A safer alternative is cracking the egg and poaching it in water.","Labor senator Helen Polley has raised eyebrows with an unusual technique for cooking hardboiled eggs. In an âegg hackâ video posted to TikTok, the Tasmanian senator completely wrapped a raw egg in aluminium foil, submerged it in a plastic container of water, and said she microwaved it for six to seven minutes for a hard boil. âEvery time Iâm cooking them in my Canberra office â¦ everyoneâs just really taken aback, saying: you canât put foil into the microwave!â Polley told Guardian Australia. âThis is something Iâve been doing for probably 25 years, if not longer, and Iâve never had a mishap. âI didnât perfect this,â the senator added. âIt was my mother-in-law who demonstrated it to me many years ago.â Polleyâs technique runs counter to general wisdom to avoid putting metal objects into microwaves. So how has the senator managed to avoid setting off fire alarms in Parliament House? Metal heads Microwaves are a frequency of electromagnetic radiation that work primarily by heating up the water molecules in food. Metals, on the other hand, absorb much less of this radiation, and tend to reflect most of the microwaves away from their surface. Itâs why microwave ovens are entirely lined with metal, with a thin metal mesh embedded in their front doors. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Technically, a microwave oven is an example of whatâs known as a Faraday cage, according to Prof Zdenka Kuncic, a physicist at the University of Sydney. âItâs preventing the electromagnetic radiation from seeping outside.â Exposing a metal object to microwave radiation will mean the metal absorbs some of it, but can also lead to electrostatic sparks, particularly if the metal is thin, pointed, or has sharp corners, as in the case of crumpled aluminium foil. âYou really only need a very thin layer of metal to cause sparks,â Kuncic said. âGenerally speaking, even if you had really thick metal, the absorption and the sparking would really only affect â¦ the outermost layer.â US guidelines suggest aluminium foil can be used in the microwave in certain circumstances, such as using small pieces of smooth foil to âshieldâ parts of food so they donât overheat. Kuncic said in Polleyâs case, the water surrounding the egg-in-foil served two purposes. âOne is to insulate the electrical sparks from the foil â to prevent them from flying around. The second thing is to actually help cook the egg, which would otherwise not really cook because itâs got foil around it.â âMicrowaves work by jiggling around the all the water molecules. When youâve got a little tub of water in there, itâs heating up the water,â she said. âThe egg would be to some extent insulated by the foil directly from the microwaves, [but] the water surrounding it will heat up and that heat can get transferred through the foil into the egg to cook it.â Dr Nathan Kilah, a senior lecturer in chemistry at the University of Tasmania agreed: âThe water there is basically preventing the aluminium from arcing [sparking] in a way that it normally would.â Eggsplosion risk In 2019, a contributor to a Woolworths community site detailed the same technique as Polleyâs, but one of the respondents, who did not submerge the egg in water, warned: âLast year I blew up my new $600 microwave doing this.â Foil aside, whole eggs with shells are prone to explosion when cooked or heated in the microwave. One case report published in the British Medical Journal, titled âPenetrating ocular trauma from an exploding microwaved eggâ, details the plight of a nine-year-old girl who reheated an already boiled egg with an intact shell âat full power for about 40 secondsâ. âThe heated egg was removed from the microwave oven and placed in a bowl. Around 30 seconds later, as she was carrying it to the dining area, the egg exploded with part of it hitting her right eye and face,â the report noted, going on to detail the eye surgery she subsequently required. Kilah explained: âThe water in the egg turns to steam, and â¦ it canât escape from the shell, which leads to it exploding. The air space in the egg would also expand with the heat. âAdding an egg directly to boiling water can make it crack â so the air is expanding against the shell, but itâs not so dramatic, as the internal egg temperature doesnât warm up as quickly.â A safer option for those who are insistent upon cooking their eggs in the microwave would be to crack the egg first and poach it in water.",Guardian,14/04/2023,Cracking method or recipe for disaster?

10,"The ban on TikTok from Australian government devices may be ineffective if public servants and politicians continue to use the app on their personal mobile devices, warns Dr. Katharine Kemp from the University of New South Wales. Using personal email addresses to log into apps on both work and personal phones allows data matching, enabling TikTok to access information held on government devices. This issue is not unique to TikTok, as social media companies commonly share data from multiple platforms. To address privacy concerns effectively, a ban on data-matching between apps would be necessary in addition to banning TikTok.","TikTok could still access information held on Australian government devices if public servants and politicians continue to use the app on their personal mobile devices, according to a legal academic from the University of New South Wales. Dr Katharine Kemp, who focuses on consumer law and has researched a wide variety of privacy policies for digital apps, said the loophole could limit the effectiveness of the ban on TikTok from government devices. âIf the employee uses their personal email address to log into apps on both their work phone and their personal phone, TikTok and the other company could match data from the two separate phones,â she said. This kind of data sharing is not exclusive to TikTok, and social media companies defend it as typical across the industry. Kemp said through collecting multiple data points related to a device, companies can then uniquely identify that device and track it in what is called âfingerprintingâ. TikTok declined to comment, but the companyâs privacy policy indicates information can be shared from other social media platforms in cases where that account is used to log in to TikTok, as is common practice with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Google accounts. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Last week the federal attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, announced that federal public servants and politicians with government-issued phones must delete the Chinese-owned app from their devices as soon as possible, and would not be permitted to install it except in limited circumstances. In announcing the ban, the government stated TikTok âposes significant security and privacy risks to non-corporate commonwealth entities arising from extensive collection of user data and exposure to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government that conflict with Australian lawâ. Last week the government faced criticism from the Greens for focusing on TikTok alone rather than the privacy concerns of all social media apps. Kemp said in order for the TikTok ban to be effective, the government would also need to ban data-matching between the apps. âData security and privacy choices canât be addressed by removing an app from a particular device,â she said. âTikTok and other digital platforms donât just collect personal data from a single digital âlocationâ. âThey have collection points all over the place that feed information back to the platform, even when you use different devices for different apps.â A spokesperson for Dreyfus directed Guardian Australia to the department. The department spokesperson did not directly address the issues raised, but said the existing government device ban would âminimise the security and privacy risks posed by the TikTok applicationâ. The opposition spokesperson on cybersecurity, Senator James Paterson, said the government ban was the first step. âRemoving it was important but is not a panacea,â he said. âA comprehensive response which encompasses risks like these and also those posed by other applications is clearly necessary. I hope the Albanese government is doing that work right now.â The move to ban TikTok from government devices followed similar bans in other parts of the world including the UK, Canada, New Zealand and the US.

12,"TikTok creators are worried about the possibility of a US ban due to concerns over its Chinese ties, but the app continues to thrive with over 150 million active users in the US. Creators highlight the app's role in income generation, community-building, and education. They express concerns about losing a platform that fosters personal expression, relationships, and political activism among young users. Creators speculate on the potential migration of TikTok's content style to other platforms and the emergence of US-based alternatives.","TikTok is at an existential crossroads, facing an unprecedented global crackdown and a potential ban in the US â and TikTok creators are caught in the balance. The platform is under bipartisan scrutiny over allegations that its parent company ByteDance is influenced by the government of China, where it is based. But those concerns have yet to dull the publicâs enthusiasm â with the app more popular than ever and now surpassing 150m active users in the US. The world of TikTok is unique and diverse, from people sharing videos of pets or conducting live ASMR shows, to building community around hobbies such as cooking and gardening. Creators have protested the ban outside Congress, saying it would diminish the ability to use TikTok to generate income, or as an educational and network-building tool. So how are these creators feeling about this moment? We asked a range of people to describe their experience on the app and what will happen if it goes away. Nathalie Adkins and her son, RJ Handle: @natlivingselfcare TikTok follower count: 53,300 followers Primary content: A cooking vlog in which Nathalieâs 9-year-old son RJ Nathan Phillips tries recipes from different cultures, sharing the process and results. How she and her son use TikTok: When I first got involved in TikTok, I was using it for information and tutorials. One day, my son said he wanted to make some noodles so I said, âOK, can I film you making some noodles?â It got such rave reviews, I started posting every time he cooks. It really brought him out of his shell because heâs neurodivergent and heâs not very expressive. Since we started this journey, all of a sudden he wants to do commentary, he wants to dance, he wants to plan his next video. The contrast has been amazing. It is easier to find community on TikTok. Now my son, a black boy from Los Angeles, has made 17 international dishes â it has connected him with communities of people from Armenia, Korea and China, that love him because he appreciates their culture. If anything were to happen to my son, as he grows into a young black man, I want people to see him as a human being. I want to know people will stand up for him. He wonât be alone. Thatâs why I do it. On how a ban would affect them: We will be OK, but it will make me feel some type of way about our government and my first amendment rights. Itâs not just about TikTok, it is about how our elected officials are using their power to to keep us down. We will survive without TikTok, but it makes me anxious that they can take something like this away so quickly. On the wider impact: I have connected with a lot of Gen Z TikTokers who are ready to fight. Itâs not just about TikTok â itâs about old people who donât know anything about technology trying to restrict it. Youâre going to turn a bunch of young people into political activists. Ross Pomerantz Handle: @corporate.bro TikTok follower count: 206,500 Primary content: Satirical videos about millennial corporate life How he uses TikTok: I got on TikTok about three years ago. I was like every millennial becoming the boomer they never thought they become â like, âThis is for the kids. I donât want to learn another platform.â But I put myself on and started making videos. It is fascinating because building a following doesnât really matter â you can still go viral if you have no followers. So, in terms of making an income stream, it is less effort to make videos that perform well and in that regard, itâs been nice. Itâs a great place to find new fans and gain new audiences. On how a ban would affect him: It would certainly hurt the the bottom line. But as a creator who uses multiple platforms, I wonât be as deeply impacted. Itâs a great sandbox to play in, but the best content I make, I cross post. On the wider impact: I think the content creation style of TikTok will ultimately migrate to other platforms. People have assumed [the action against TikTok] has been a result of Meta lobbying â but I think YouTube will actually be the main benefactor. Who knows? Maybe a US-based copycat will pop up in TikTokâs place and we will be back where we started. People are going to be enraged for a few weeks like they are with any major issue. The question is: what they will do about it? Alexis Devine and Bunny the Dog Handle: @whataboutbunny TikTok follower count: 8.3m Primary content: Bunny the dog communicates with her caretakers using buttons that convey objects, ideas and feelings. How she uses TikTok: I started a TikTok account in early 2020 to document the success my dog Bunny was having communicating with programmable buttons. Developing an audience on TikTok happened very quickly and led to the development of a much larger community of humans using buttons to enable alternative methods of communication with their animal companions. Many of these people are now participants of a research study. Iâm not sure that without TikTok that would have been possible. On how a ban would impact her: I make a little bit of money from the creator fund on TikTok. The loss of that income wouldnât have a significant impact on my life at the moment, but as an independent contractor every little bit matters. On the wider impact: I donât think there is a comparable platform at the moment and while creators and viewers will have no choice but to try and find other platforms and communities within which to thrive, it wonât be the same. I have learned so much from educational content on TikTok. Content that is niche, authentic, invaluable and the likes of which I havenât found on other platforms. The loss of TikTok would be a huge blow not only to creators that depend on TikTok income, but also to me, a lifelong learner. Alexander Maupin Handle: @alex_makes1 TikTok follower count: 160,700 followers Primary content: Alexander produces a variety of content but has gained a large following for live videos in which they individually pop kernels of popcorn using a hair straightener. How they use TikTok: I do a little bit of everything. Last year, I was dealing with a lot of depression and anxiety and I came across another Live user who was popping popcorn, but it was very low-key and kind of an ASMR vibe. So I flipped the script and got colorful lights and a huge speaker. I just try to be as entertaining as possible. On how a ban would affect them: TikTok is more about community. Iâve met so many interesting people on TikTok with similar interests to me that I would have never met on Facebook or Instagram. If it disappeared, it would be really sad because I would lose a lot of friends overnight. On the wider impact: People are resilient â they will congregate somewhere else. There are 150m US users and that is going to give people a lot of idle time â it will be interesting to see what they will do with it. I think this will create more of a push for reform.

13,"Viral food trends on social media, such as vodka pasta sauce and pasta chips, are driving product development in the grocery sector. Brands like Heinz and Absolut have launched a limited edition vodka pasta sauce inspired by social media trends. Retailers are incorporating popular online food crazes into their product lines, influenced by influencers and social media users. While not all online interactions are successful, engaging with social media can have a tangible impact on sales and consumer engagement. Young digital-native consumers and older generations on platforms like Facebook are shaping product development.","Sometimes you just need some vodka pasta sauce â especially when youâve been grounded for trying to charter a helicopter on your dadâs credit card. When Sofia Coppolaâs 16-year-old daughter, Romy Mars, set the internet alight last month after doing just that â and then recorded a TikTok video to complain about her punishment while making the sauce â there was plenty of discussion about her family dynamics. Others, though, were more interested in her food choices. Vodka pasta sauce has been a viral favourite among social media users since the model Gigi Hadid posted a how-to video to her Instagram stories in 2020, sparking an instant food craze among her fans. Two of those fans have now been revealed to be Heinz and the vodka brand Absolut, who have jointly launched a limited edition run of their own version of the sauce, which they say comes from their commitment to innovate âat the speed of social media trendsâ. Online fads driven by a brief celebrity clip might seem trivial but to retailers, especially in the highly competitive grocery sector, they are anything but. Vodka pasta sauce is far from the only viral craze to have found itself on supermarket shelves in recent years. Pasta chips, cloud bread, and an alarming bubblegum-coloured condiment called âpink sauceâ have all made the journey from wildly popular videos to mainstream product lines. TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, in other words, are not just where brandsâ customers are â they are also potentially where their next product ideas can be found. âTraditionally with product development, you would get people together, ask them some questions and develop products on the back of that,â says Jamie Ray, a co-founder of Buttermilk, a specialist brand and influencer agency. âBut now the speed of information is all driven by social. âFor brands, itâs about looking at what is making viral moments, [then thinking], OK, influencers are dictating that this trend is really going somewhere, we need to incorporate that in our next line of products.â One clear example is that of Twisted, which has just launched its own branded range of social media-friendly foods â think foot-long pigs in blankets on spits and lasagne-filled yorkshire puddings â with the frozen supermarket giant Iceland. Twisted began in 2016 when Tom Jackson and a friend began filming food videos from their flat in Brixton and posting them on Facebook, inspired by a philosophy they sum up as âunserious food tastes seriously goodâ. âAnd yeah, within nine weeks, we had a million followers on Facebook,â says Jackson. Now a fully fledged social media company, they have a core team of content producers, a cookbook, a publishing arm and 40 million followers across all social media platforms. More than 60% of those watching say they have tried a Twisted recipe at home, making the crossover appeal to established retailers obvious. âItâs not just about being viral, or at least not any more. Itâs tangible, youâre reaching inside the screen, and you can actually eat it,â Jackson says. âAnd while the products are fun, or might sound a bit wacky, they taste delicious.â Engaging with social media can flop as well as fly, notes Dom Boyd, the managing director of UK insights and marketing at the retail analysts Kantar, who points out that a quarter of adverts bought on digital platforms have zero or negative effects. Interactions must be authentic for a brandâs demographic, he says, âotherwise youâre the dad at the discoâ. And while the buying power of young, digital-native consumers can be huge, it is often poorly understood, says Helenor Gilmour, the director of insight and strategy at the kids insight consultancy Beano Brain. The retail influence of Generation Alpha (under 13) consumers, for instance, extends way beyond viral crazes such as the YouTuber-promoted Prime energy drinks â which have resulted in shoppers queueing for hours to grab a bottle â to influence even the car market, she says. Recent research from Beano Brain found that 69% of Gen Aâs parents say they make better decisions about the planet because of their young children. âItâs not unusual for us to hear of kids influencing not just the brand of car but even the shift to electric cars.â Donât assume, however, that itâs only young social media fans driving product development, says Ellis Hawthorne, features editor at Retail Week. âYou canât discount even baby boomers from a seeing food viral videos, even though they may not be on TikTok. These videos are making their way around Instagram and Facebook too â and that generation are frequently on Facebook.â She cites pink gin as a now-mainstream product line where its development was driven by older social media users. For most major brands, online trends are now âcompletely ingrainedâ into their product development, Hawthorne says, âBut you have to remember that these viral trends are a very, very small part of their businesses. âIf you think about the average person going in and doing their weekly shop â whether they saw a TikTok about feta pasta isnât going to be really that relevant to the bottom line of these companies.â",Guardian,8/04/2023,TikTok to a Heinz jar: vodka pasta sauceâs journey from fad to supermarket shelves,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/08/instagram-tiktok-heinz-vodka-pasta-sauce-social-media-food-brands

15,"TikTok has been fined £12.7m by Britain's data watchdog for illegally processing the data of 1.4 million children under the age of 13 without parental consent. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) found that TikTok had failed to check user ages and remove underage users, despite internal warnings. The fine comes after the app was banned from UK government phones due to security concerns. The ICO estimated that up to 1.4 million children under 13 had used the platform, with their personal data potentially being used to track and profile them. TikTok has stated that it disagrees with the ICO's decision and has made changes to its practices since the investigation.","TikTok has been fined Â£12.7m for illegally processing the data of 1.4 million children under 13 who were using its platform without parental consent, Britainâs data watchdog said. The information commissioner said the China-owned video app had done âvery little, if anythingâ to check who was using the platform and remove underage users, despite internal warnings the firm was flouting its own terms and conditions. âOur findings were that TikTok were not doing enough to prevent under-13s accessing their platform, they were not doing enough when they became aware of under-13s to get rid of them, and they were not doing enough to detect under-13s on there,â John Edwards told the Guardian on Tuesday. âThey assure us that they are now doing more.â The fine from the Information Commissionerâs Office (ICO) comes weeks after the app was banned from UK government phones amid security concerns. It is fast becoming a flashpoint for the UKâs handling of big tech and Chinese influence. After the announcement of the fine, one of the largest the watchdog has given, Rishi Sunak was accused of moving too slowly in taking action against TikTok â and was called ânaive for assuming TikTok could ever regulate itselfâ. UK data protection law does not have a strict ban on children using the internet but requires organisations that use the personal data of children to obtain consent from their parents or carers. TikTok itself bans those under 13 in its terms and conditions. The failure to enforce age limits led to âup to 1.4 million UK childrenâ under 13 using the platform as of 2020, the ICO estimated. âThere was a whole bunch of stuff that they could have been doing that they werenât,â Edwards said. âAll that was required was a self-certification that the applicant was over 13, by clicking a box with no verification, with no extra checks. We understand that there are now significantly more checks and balances in place to detect that kind of thing.â Edwards added: âThere are laws in place to make sure our children are as safe in the digital world as they are in the physical world. TikTok did not abide by those laws. âAs a consequence, an estimated 1 million under-13s were inappropriately granted access to the platform, with TikTok collecting and using their personal data. That means that their data may have been used to track them and profile them, potentially delivering harmful, inappropriate content at their very next scroll. âTikTok should have known better, TikTok should have done better. They did not do enough to check who was using their platform or take sufficient action to remove the underage children that were using their platform.â The ICOâs investigation found that concern was raised internally but that TikTok did not respond âadequatelyâ. In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson said: âTikTok is a platform for users aged 13 and over. We invest heavily to help keep under-13s off the platform and our 40,000-strong safety team works around the clock to help keep the platform safe for our community. âWhile we disagree with the ICOâs decision, which relates to May 2018 to July 2020, we are pleased that the fine announced today has been reduced to under half the amount proposed last year. We will continue to review the decision and are considering next steps.â TikTok emphasised that it had changed its practices since the period the ICO investigated. Now, in common with social media peers, the site uses more signals than a usersâ self-declared age when trying to determine how old they are, including training its moderators to identify underage accounts and providing tools for parents to request the deletion of their underage childrenâs accounts. The accusations also pre-date the introduction of the ICOâs âage appropriate design codeâ, which specifies an even stricter set of rules that platforms are expected to follow when handling the personal data of children. That code also makes it more explicit that platforms cannot argue ignorance over the ages of younger users as a defence for failing to treat their personal data carefully. âWe will be looking at other providers of services likely to be accessed by children and checking the ways in which theyâre doing age verification,â Edwards said. In 2019, TikTok was hit with a $5.7m fine by the US Federal Trade Commission for similar practices. That fine, a record at the time, was also levied against TikTok for improper data collection from children under 13. At the time the company committed to improving its practices and said it would begin keeping younger users in âage-appropriate TikTok environmentsâ, where those under 13 would be pushed into a more passive role, able to watch videos, but not post or comment on the platform. John Hayes, a Conservative MP who pushed Sunak to toughen up the online harms bill, warned the government it would be forced to return to the issue of regulation âtime and again because the idea that companies like TikTok will ever regulate themselves is for the birdsâ. Labour has accused the government of failing to protect children online. Alex Davies-Jones, the shadow digital and tech minister, said: âMinisters have been passing the buck and platforms have been acting with impunity.â She added: âThe government and tech companies have a clear responsibility to ensure young people are safe online and this episode shows they are failing that duty. Labour has long campaigned for stronger protections online and if this government fails to act the next Labour government will.â",Guardian,4/04/2023,TikTok fined Â£12.7m for illegally processing childrenâs data,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/04/tiktok-fined-uk-data-protection-law-breaches

However it is likely to have flow-on effects to government and non-government businesses. A spokesperson for the ABC confirmed that in light of the ban, the ABC was reviewing its use of the platform. âThe ABC will review current use of the platform on ABC devices following the governmentâs decision to prohibit the TikTok app on devices issued by commonwealth departments and agencies,â a spokesperson said. âThe ABC has a suite of cybersecurity protocols, which include measures and policies relating to the use of social media applications on ABC devices.â As with most media outlets, the ABC publishes news on TikTok among other social media platforms. The spokesperson said the ABC has âan ongoing dialogueâ with the Australian Cyber Security Centre on threats and vulnerabilities, and will work with the government as more information about the ban is made available. Australia Post has confirmed it is also âreviewing the TikTok direction and considering any potential implicationsâ. A spokesperson for NBN Co said it ceased using TikTok for corporate social media communications earlier this year and is reviewing the use of TikTok by employees on company-issued mobile devices.

TikTokâs Australia and New Zealand general manager, Lee Hunter, said TikTok should not be singled out. âThere is no evidence to suggest that TikTok is in any way a security risk to Australians and should not be treated differently to other social media platforms,â Hunter said in a statement. He said TikTok was âextremely disappointedâ by the decision and it was âdriven by politics, not factâ. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said the Coalition would support government decisions to keep Australian citizens safe, and which were âin our national interestâ. âIf the government has advice that itâs unsafe to have TikTok on those government phones then theyâre acting on that advice and we would support that decision.â",Guardian,4/04/2023,ABC to review use of TikTok after app banned from Australian government devices,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/05/abc-to-review-use-of-tiktok-after-app-banned-from-australian-government-devices

18,"The Australian government has announced a ban on the use of TikTok on government devices, citing significant security and privacy risks. The ban follows similar actions taken by other Western countries. Exemptions will be granted on a case-by-case basis with appropriate security measures. Over half of all federal government agencies already prohibit TikTok, and the ban aims to ensure consistency across the government. TikTok's Australia and New Zealand general manager expressed disappointment, stating there is no evidence to suggest TikTok poses a security risk. The opposition supports the ban and may push for a review on the use of TikTok on personal devices.","The Australian government has banned the use of Chinese social media app TikTok on government devices, following similar bans in other western countries. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said he had authorised the secretary of his department to issue a mandatory direction to prohibit the TikTok app on devices issued by commonwealth departments and agencies. âThe direction will come into effect as soon as practicable,â he said. âExemptions will only be granted on a case-by-case basis and with appropriate security mitigations in place.â According to the protective security direction issued with the ban, the government states TikTok âposes significant security and privacy risks to non-corporate Commonwealth entities arising from extensive collection of user data and exposure to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government that conflict with Australian law.â Last month the government received a review from the Department of Home Affairs on the security risks of all social media platforms and the correct government settings. Over half of all federal government agencies currently ban TikTok from government devices, but the overarching policy will ensure consistency across the government. The states and territories were advised of the planned ban on Monday. A Victorian government spokesperson said it would work to adopt the new restrictions on the use of TikTok, while a New South Wales government spokesperson said Cyber Security NSW would continue discussions with the federal government on the new position. TikTok was not informed about the proposed ban prior to it being leaked to media, the companyâs Australia and New Zealand general manager Lee Hunter said. He said in a statement that TikTok was âextremely disappointedâ by the decision, which the company said was âdriven by politics, not factâ. âAgain, we stress that there is no evidence to suggest that TikTok is in any way a security risk to Australians,â he said, adding that it should not be treated differently to other social media platforms. âOur millions of Australian users deserve a government which makes decisions based upon facts and who treats all businesses fairly, regardless of country of origin.â Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The shadow cybersecurity minister, James Paterson, told Sky News the government had been âvery very lateâ in implementing the ban on government devices. The federal opposition had long been calling for the government to act, despite the Coalition failing to do so when in government less than a year ago. Paterson said most of the revelations around security concerns with TikTok and the subsequent government device bans by governments including the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand only occurred in the past few months. Paterson indicated the opposition would now push for a review on the use of TikTok on personal devices including opening up the possibility of a national ban â something the United States is currently considering. âItâs good that itâs going to be banned from government devices because it removes that espionage risk to public servants,â he said. âBut the data privacy and security risks and also the foreign interference risks that affect millions of Australians using the platform are so far and yet not to be dealt with and they have to be dealt with.â He said that an outright ban of TikTok should be on the table because it could potentially force TikTokâs parent company ByteDance to consider divesting the company from Chinese control. Several MPs, including environment minister Tanya Plibersek and Labor MP Julian Hill, still use TikTok on nongovernment devices. Paterson said he does not use the app, and government services minister Bill Shorten and Victorian premier Daniel Andrews announced on Tuesday they would stop using TikTok. But Greens senator David Shoebridge said the ban wasnât a serious reform because its focus was too limited. âIf weâre not careful it will just be the first hammer blow in an endless game of online whack-a-mole,â he said. âWeâre in a data security and privacy crisis and weâre fixated on one platform. âThe data security issues for TikTok are mirrored in pretty much every other social media platform, the difference is that our government is not running a fear campaign against the governments that host those platforms.â",Guardian,4/04/2023,Australia-wide ban of TikTok on government devices announced as senior politicians quit the app,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/04/australia-wide-ban-of-tiktok-on-government-devices-announced-as-senior-politicians-quit-the-app
19,"TikTok, the immensely popular social media app with over 1 billion users worldwide, is facing increasing political scrutiny and potential deletion. The Chinese-owned company is caught in a geopolitical standoff due to concerns over China's rise as a superpower and mistrust of Beijing. TikTok's success is driven by its engaging content and addictive recommendation algorithm, which collects vast amounts of user data. Security concerns revolve around potential misuse of personal data, device infections, and Chinese state interference. Additionally, there are growing anxieties about TikTok's impact on users' mental health. The app's future remains uncertain as it faces bans and regulatory actions in various countries.","Sitting at the heart of youth culture, TikTok is beloved of its more than 1 billion users worldwide. With a range of compelling content that extends from viral dances to comedy skits, cleaning hacks, BookTok, music and the Gen Z melancholy of the corecore trend, it is the app of the 21st century. But in the sphere of western politics, the Chinese-owned company is increasingly friendless â caught in a geopolitical standoff between the rise of China as a superpower and mistrust of Beijing in countries where so many of the short-video appâs users are based. As a consequence, TikTok faces a serious threat of deletion, with the US leading the charge. Here, the Guardianâs technology editors explain how TikTok became a social media sensation â and why politicians and health experts are now gunning for it. The phenomenon TikTok is enormously successful, on both sides of the Atlantic. The companyâs chief executive, Shou Zi Chew (whose Singaporean heritage was emphasised when he testified in front of the US Congress last week), says the app has more than 150 million monthly active users in the US alone. In the UK, Ofcom data shows that this time last year the average TikTok user (of those older than 15) spent 29 minutes a day on the app, only slightly less than the time spent on Facebook and Messenger combined. Last year TikTok had 18 million users in the UK, according to the analytics firm data.ai. But for the companyâs core demographic, aged between 15 and 24, engagement in the UK is through the roof: the average young adult TikToker spends almost an hour a day on the app. And while Instagram and YouTube have more absolute users, TikTok is catching up fast. In the first quarter of 2022 in the UK, 73% of 15- to 24-year-olds had used the app, vastly outstripping peers such as Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat. Comparable stats for 2023 are not yet available but every indication suggests that usage has risen further. This combination of attention span and demographics makes the app very appealing to advertisers, who spent more than $10bn (Â£8.1bn) on the platform last year, according to industry estimates. TikTokâs popularity is driven in part by the recommendation algorithm that drives its main feed, the âFor Youâ page. The app seems to have an uncanny ability for working out what you like â and reels you in, hence that daily viewing time. Marc Faddoul, a director at AI Forensics, a European non-profit that investigates algorithms, says TikTokâs key advantage is its ability to build a detailed psychological and subject interest profile of users who scroll through endless videos, leaving a trail of revealing data. âWhat makes TikTok special and different to others is the rate at which it collects data from your interaction with it. If you spend an hour on TikTok, you are going to scroll through many hundreds â up to 1,000 â videos, and each view will generate data, such as length of viewing time, that allows TikTok to refine its targeting.â He adds that the way TikTok shows one video at a time across a mobile screen means a userâs scrolling behaviour generates âprecise and rapid feedbackâ from every video. But that uncanny algorithm is also driving the very suspicion that could kill the app. That suspicion was heightened in the aftermath of Chewâs appearance in front of Congress last week. The morning after, users across the world reported a flood of âpro-Chewâ videos appearing on their For You pages, and shared their suspicions that TikTok was artificially promoting content that supported its stance against the bans. TikTok denies any interference and says it did not promote the Chew clips. Others countered that the algorithm was simply reflecting the TikTok audienceâs own pro-TikTok feelings. But the opacity that enables that suspicion is the same opacity that legislators worry could be weaponised by a Chinese state that has little regard for rule of law and a history of strong-arming commercial organisations into compliance. Security fears The security concerns around TikTok are threefold, according to Bryan Cunningham, a former White House lawyer and adviser to the US data security firm Theon Technology. They are: misuse of personal data gleaned from the app, which could be used to profile users who, for instance, work for foreign governments; using the app to infect a userâs device; and the Chinese Communist party using the appâs compelling algorithm to manipulate the For You feed and, thus, public opinion. Cunningham, and many other TikTok critics, point to Chinese security laws that require cooperation with the state, including a 2017 national security law in China that requires organisations and citizens to âsupport, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence workâ. While Cunningham acknowledges that no definitive proof has been produced of Chinese state interference in TikTok, he says the concerns about the appâs data harvesting and its ownership are enough to warrant a move against it. âWe donât know if the sabotage aspect or the data exfiltration has happened,â he says. âBut my view is itâs certainly all theoretically possible. And as far as Iâm concerned, as a national security lawyer thatâs enough for us to take action.â These worries have already led to a series of bans of TikTok on government-issued phones in countries including the US, Canada and the UK as well as in the EUâs executive arm, the European Commission. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a US government body that reviews foreign investment on national security grounds, has decided TikTokâs ties to China pose an unacceptable security risk of state interference, and has ordered ByteDance, TikTokâs Beijing-based parent company, to divest itself of the app or face a ban. If ByteDance refuses, or tries to spin off a diminished version of TikTok, then Americans could wake up one day to find their favourite app no longer exists. Any attempt to ban the app would be likely to prompt legal action against the US government â TikTok successfully fought off similar moves by the Trump administration in 2020. TikTok says it is pushing ahead with a data security plan that appears to have been rejected by the US government, which involves user data being stored on third-party servers owned by the US tech firm Oracle, with that same company vetting app updates that are sent to the Apple and Android app stores. It has also announced a similar plan for the storage of European data. However, what the US does with TikTok is influential elsewhere. Before the UK government announced a TikTok ban on official phones, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: âWe look at what our allies are doing.â In the US, momentum is clearly building towards further action against the app. A TikTok spokesperson said recent government bans were âbased on fundamental misconceptions and driven by wider geopoliticsâ in which the app played no part. âWe remain committed to working with governments and partners to address any security concerns, but ask to be judged on facts, not fears, and treated equally to our competitors,â they said. There has been no definitive proof of criticsâ concerns about TikTok, but several news stories have raised doubts. In 2019, the Guardian revealed that TikTokâs moderation guidelines helped promote Beijingâs view of foreign policy, while last year BuzzFeed reported that China-based employees at ByteDance had accessed nonpublic data about US TikTok users. Then in December, TikTokâs credibility was damaged when ByteDance admitted that employees had used the app to spy on reporters. TikTokâs privacy policy is clear that it accesses, among other things, your email address, your contacts, your direct messages, payment details and location. That is not substantially different from other social media apps such as Instagram. But other social media apps do not have to be as squeaky clean in the way that TikTok does if it is to allay fears. Health concerns Security is not the only issue facing TikTok â there are growing anxieties about the effect it has on usersâ mental health. In some respects, they echo the concerns raised with other social media platforms, and relate to its recommendation algorithm and teen mental health. For instance, last year an EU-backed study by academics and clinicians on young people and internet-related mental health set out some of the problems. The study interviewed a British 17-year-old girl with a history of binge-eating disorders and suicidal behaviours, who said she was able to access content teaching people how to become anorexic via typing in a hashtag. She said users found a way to circumvent TikTokâs moderators, including putting content about eating disorders in the comment section. â[To make sure] they donât get taken down, the video itself, what they do is they say: âLook in the comments for this.â So, itâs just music playing in the background, an empty screen and look at the comments. You open up the comments and the comments section is full of these random people giving you eating disorder tips â¦ And itâs like sharing stuff in secret ways that Iâve realised, yes, people are really good at finding stuff like that.â A 16-year-old British boy in the same study said his use of TikTok resembled an addiction. âItâs not that it was not fun, it was consuming a lot of my time and I really disliked it. I deleted it before, but I ended up getting it again because I got an addiction to it in a way.â The reportâs lead author, Prof Sonia Livingstone at the London School of Economics, says even well-balanced teenagers that she talks to struggle to âpull awayâ from the app. She adds: âYoung people tell me over and again that they have a sense of compulsion to stay on the app, to see the next thing and the next thing, because the videos are short, attention grabbing and because they are popular.â Livingstone says she has spoken to young people who try to create âcoping strategiesâ such as âfollowing happier hashtags to balance the flow of content they are servedâ. She adds that young TikTok users find it âquite scaryâ how their interaction with the platform is being measured. Further research published last year suggests TikTokâs algorithm pushes self-harm and eating disorder content to teenagers within minutes of them expressing interest in the topics on the app. The Center for Countering Digital Hate, which carried out the study via a series of âfakeâ accounts for 13-year-olds, said the results were âevery parentâs nightmareâ. TikTok said the study did not reflect the experience or viewing habits of real-life users of the app. A TikTok spokesperson said the company aimed to make the app âa place where people can share their true selves, raise awareness for important causes and find communityâ. Indeed, the EU-backed mental health report flags how TikTok can help people in recovery from eating disorders. The company also announced this month that teenagers joining TikTok would be limited to an hour of use each day, although the restriction can be altered or removed entirely in the appâs settings. TikTok is also far from the first social media app to be subject to concerns about mental health. Mark Zuckerbergâs Meta was accused by the whisteblower Frances Haugen in 2021 of failing to address internal research showing the negative impact of its Instagram platform on teen mental health. That may be the paradox at the heart of TikTok. From its aggressive data collection, to fears it is harming the mental wellbeing of its young users, and even the central importance of the app on youth culture around the world, the app can sometimes feel as American as it comes. But in the only way that matters, it is not â and that could be an unsurmountable hurdle.",Guardian,31/03/2023,TikTok: why the app with 1bn users faces a fight for its existence,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/31/tiktok-why-the-app-with-1bn-users-faces-a-fight-for-its-existence
20,"The rise of ""corecore"" videos on TikTok is explored in this article. These videos, characterized by splicing together various clips from celebrities, TV shows, and films, set to melancholic music, reflect themes of disconnection and alienation. Initially seen as a joke, corecore videos have gained popularity, with many young people finding them relatable and emotionally resonant. They serve as a way to express feelings and connect with others. The article suggests that corecore may be considered a form of art and a reflection of the frustrations and anxieties experienced by Gen Z.","Jimmy Nguyen, an 18-year-old student, saw his first âcorecoreâ video on TikTok in January. He canât remember which one it was â there are so many of them now. But he says it was typical of this new trend of video: other TikTok videos, celebrity or podcaster interviews, TV show and film clips spliced together over some sad or ambient music. Theyâre depressing, full of existential dread and usually on the theme of disconnection and alienation. Nguyen initially thought, like other users, that these videos were a joke. Theyâre crudely edited and the name in itself is a sarcastic reference to the proliferation of micro-trends emerging from TikTok since 2020. But he was soon staying up late at night in his bedroom making corecore of his own. âAs I was making my first video I started to really see myself expressing how I was feeling and it felt relieving because I didnât have anyone to talk to and explaining my emotions is hard,â he tells me. âBut that video felt like an exit or gateway to those feelings.â In it, clips of Lee Jung-jae, the lead in Squid Game smiling broadly and falsely at the camera, someone recounting how in school kids would ask which super power youâd want out of invisibility and flying but he says âIâm already invisibleâ and Jake Gyllenhall in Stronger (2017) screaming âWhy do you even want me? Iâm such a fuck up!â run into each other over a morose Arcade Fire track. Now Nguyen makes these videos in an attempt to help people, he says, to let them know that theyâre not alone. To date, the corecore hashtag on TikTok has 2.1bn views. Some young people consider this genre to be merely content or, worse still, content about content. But many feel it speaks to them and their experiences on a deep emotional level. âTheyâre my favourite type of TikTok video because they feel raw and real,â says 20-year-old Annabelle from London. âThe combination of clips just somehow summarises everything thatâs bad about life but I couldnât quite tell you why.â Or as one commenter put it on a corecore video about struggling to date and the toxicity of modern relationships perpetuated by all genders: âwhy am i crying over thisâ. âThis form of video started with ânichetokâ where youâd see really random clips spliced together, like footballers scoring goals, Peep Show clips and performances from Oasis and Blur. It was masculine and all the boys were making it,â says Eden Young, managing editor of Polyester zine and podcast co-host. âPeople wanted something a bit deeper and carved something more meaningful from this trend, which led to corecore.â Itâs fairly obvious why Gen Z would enjoy corecore. You can be moved by these videos without knowing the sources of the clips but if you understand the pop, cultural and internet culture references, you feel special. Like most internet humour, if you get it, you get it. âEverything feels very hopeless and corecore speaks to these frustrations and anxieties. Itâs a way to laugh at how hopeless everything is â or at least get some meaning from it. You have a lightbulb moment that says: oh yeah, the world is bullshit,â says Young. Are these videos art? A new frontier in amateur documentary making? âI canât see why they wouldnât be art if people are capable of reading things into the juxtapositions theyâre presenting,â says art critic and author, Philippa Snow. âWhether theyâre âgoodâ art or not is obviously debatable on a case-by-case basis, but thatâs true of absolutely every artform on Earth.â She references a quote from a TikTok user called Dean Erfani, who said that corecore is essentially the abstract concept of taking random videos and editing them together to the point that it makes sense to the viewer. Or at least have the viewer interpret it in their own way. âThat does not sound all that different to me from looking for meaning in âthe chance encounter of a sewing machine and an umbrella on an operating tableâ as the famous mantra of surrealism suggests.â In my favourite corecore video, almost euphorically bleak in its composition, Ampers Anthony edits together the following: a woman talks about her last boyfriend who had a no-crying rule, a hot man appears with the caption that he texted his ex to slow down her healing process, thereâs commentary on âbad boysâ and âgood guysâ, a guy laments that he canât manipulate his current partner, women talk about not dating broke guys. The accompanying music (Darker Than This by composer Emile Mosseri) is bright, hopeful and against this noxious film feels faintly humorous, ironic. Its top comment reads: âThis needs to be seen by everyone. Somehow this video captures it all. We are a loveless generation. You canât pour from an empty cup.â To me, it, like the others of its kind, is a simple and accessible version of an Adam Curtis film, adopting his humour and slant, the seemingly unrelated clips with his voiceover. Young notes that the writer Mark Fisherâs ideas shine through in this genre: Fisher was anti-capitalism, spoke a lot about isolation and wondered how we can process the hopelessness in the modern world. When I watch corecore, as someone who only sporadically uses TikTok, it mimics the way using the app is an overstimulating act of binge-watching a stream of short videos and voices. This trend is a smart â and sad â comment on the proliferation of content in culture: self-focused, often narcissistic commentary, opinions, life-hacks and problem sharing â itâs everywhere. The videos make me feel despondent and sorry for a generation who grew up during the pandemic and have never in their lives logged off. Whether we enjoy them or not, theyâre probably the avant garde documentaries we deserve and certainly the ones that make the most sense.",Guardian,30/03/2023,âWhy am I crying over this?â: how corecore TikTok videos caught the mood of Gen Z,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/mar/30/corecore-tiktok-videos-gen-z
21,"The article discusses the parallels between the panic over TikTok and the concerns surrounding Huawei and 5G. While the security and privacy risks associated with Chinese ownership are plausible, they lack substantial evidence. The focus should be on trust, trade, and geopolitics rather than rushing through bans that conflict with democratic traditions and may further fragment the internet. TikTok's data collection practices are similar to those of other social media platforms, but policymakers worry about the sharing of data with a Chinese company due to China's weak rule of law and human rights concerns. The article emphasizes the need for a nuanced debate that balances political differences, protects free expression, and addresses the genuine concerns of vulnerable users.","TikTokâs chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, discovered during his five-hour grilling by US Congress what Huawei could have told him all along: being owned by a Chinese company is bad for business. In fact, the panic over TikTok is a lot like like Huawei and 5G all over again. The security and privacy risks are plausible, but largely without evidence. What this is really about is trust, trade and geopolitics. The US hearings took place as the UK extended its ban of TikTok to the parliamentary estate, after initially banning the app from central government officialsâ work phones. Canada, the EU and several member states have implemented partial bans. Yet rather than taking this moment as an opportunity to revisit why democratic societies have allowed tech companies to make pervasive data collection and monitoring the norm, policymakers are rushing through bans that sit uncomfortably with the liberal democratic tradition, and are likely to accelerate the fragmentation of the internet. TikTok makes money by collecting data on its users and feeding them exactly what theyâve been profiled to respond to, including the goods and services of advertisers. Thatâs the business model of every free-to-use social media platform, and TikTok is particularly good at it. Nearly 70% of American teenagers use the app, while only 30% of the same age group use Facebook. By some estimates, young people open the app up to 19 times a day. The companyâs 5,000-word privacy policy sets out in grim detail just how much data is collected: essentially, itâs everything. The terms are also clear about the use of that data to personalise and customise your feed, fulfil purchases, personalise ads and measure their effectiveness. But the business model that TikTok shares with its US rivals does not seem to bother policymakers that much. Their anxieties are about whom that data is shared with. TikTokâs parent company, ByteDance, is Chinese â and the security concerns are real. There is Chinaâs weak rule of law, human rights concerns regarding the oppression of Uighur Muslims, and the use of technology to enforce social and political conformity to think about. There are also worries about its national security laws, which compel companies to share data with the government. Put together all the data, including device, location, IP address, content viewed, duration and frequency of use, engagement with other users and an authoritarian state, and you have a combustible mix. We also canât forget the lessons learned from the 2016 US presidential elections and the Brexit referendum onward, which indicate that hostile actors can and do manipulate algorithms designed for advertising, and subvert them for political ends. With TikTok, where the user population is young and vulnerable to exploitation and manipulation (whether towards terrorism, political radicalisation or harmful body-image anxiety), those risks are acute. As the bans mount up, TikTok has been rushing to implement confidence-building measures. The detail of its initiatives, Project Clover in the EU and Project Texas in the US, seems compelling. User data will be kept onshore in the EU or US, data practices will be vetted by trusted third parties â such as Oracle in the US â and there will be a default 60-minute screen time limit for young people. But, as with Huawei, this is not going to be enough because this was never about the details. As was clear from Congressâs aggressive questioning of TikTokâs CEO, in which he was often interrupted and talked over, US policymakers donât think they need more information. They want to communicate their distrust of China in the context of worsening geopolitical and economic tensions. This is bad news for the internet. In its early years, shared physical infrastructure and lightweight interoperable digital architecture were felt to be a shared public good. Everyone, no matter what their political differences, had an interest in getting online. Today, the tendrils of geopolitics extend into the deepest layers of the technical architecture, from undersea cables to semiconductors, to emerging technical standards. China, and Chinese companies including Huawei, have even put forward proposals at technical standards bodies that would fundamentally change the architecture of the internet, fragmenting its common structure. This might not be surprising given Chinaâs attitude towards the free flow of data; what is more concerning is seeing advanced democracies â which were supposed to fly the flag for a single, global internet â contribute to the same fragmentary tendency. A ban on TikTok would be a relief for some of its US rivals, providing them with a precious window in which to up their game with younger generations. But itâs the constitutional impact of a ban that should be troubling in the land of the first amendment. As TikTokâs popularity among young people only grows, the high politics of the current debate marginalises the genuine concerns â about addiction, the impact on mental health and body image â of that most vulnerable segment of our societies. Advanced democracies have an opportunity to have a grown-up debate on how to hold a global internet together while respecting political differences, protecting free expression and supporting the most vulnerable. Instead, the incredible benefits of our shared digital architecture are being washed away in thoughtless, kneejerk responses to the economic and political rise of China.

The chief executive of Nammo, which is co-owned by the Norwegian government, said a planned expansion of its largest factory in central Norway hit a roadblock due to a lack of surplus energy, with the construction of TikTokâs new data centre using up electricity in the local area. âWe are concerned because we see our future growth is challenged by the storage of cat videos,â Morten BrandtzÃ¦g told the Financial Times. Demand for artillery rounds is 15 times higher than normal and Europeâs munitions industry needs to invest â¬2bn in new factories to keep up with Ukraineâs needs, according to BrandtzÃ¦g. By some estimates, Ukraine is firing 6,000 to 7,000 artillery shells a day and is facing ammunition shortages after more than a year of war. European Union leaders have announced a program to reimburse countries offering artillery ammunition to Ukraine from a â¬1bn fund, while spending an additional â¬1bn on increasing ammunitions manufacturing capacity across the bloc. But plans by Nammo to expand its largest manufacturing facility appear to have come up against TikTokâs efforts to improve its image in the face of a growing number of bans across the world by housing the data of Europeans more locally. TikTok is fighting a proposed national ban in the US, where it has already been banned on most government devices. The UK government, European Commission and the European parliament also recently banned TikTok from staff phones due to concerns that user data belonging to the company â which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance â could be harvested by Chinaâs government. TikTok said last year that some employees in China could access European user data and admitted that employees had used its own app to spy on journalists in an effort to track down leaks. In a congressional hearing last week however, the companyâs CEO insisted that TikTok was entirely independent from the Chinese government and that Chinese authorities had no access to its data. However, in an effort to placate European lawmakers, TikTok said it would begin storing European user data locally this year, with migration continuing into 2024. The company said it would reduce the transfer of data outside the region, and reduce employee access to user data internally. The company announced plans to open new data centres in Ireland and in the Hamar region of Norway. Elvia, the local energy provider, confirmed to the Financial Times that the electricity network had no spare capacity after allocating it to the data centre on a first-come, first-served basis. Additional capacity would take time to become available. TikTok has been contacted for comment. International tech and social media companies are facing increased scrutiny over their operation of the huge centres used to store vast quantities of data. These centres consume large amounts of energy to power and cool the servers that store customersâ pictures, videos and other cloud-based data. By 2030, the European Commission estimates that data centres will account for 3.2% of electricity demand within the bloc, an 18.5% jump from 2018. A draft plan to force data centres to publish their environmental impact was obtained by Politico last year. Authorities âshould not be put in the position of having to choose between attracting â¦ data centres on the one hand and ensuring that businesses and households can access electricity on the other hand,â the plan said.",Guardian,28/03/2023,Norwegian company says TikTok data centre is limiting energy for manufacturing Ukraine ammunition,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/28/energy-hungry-tiktok-data-centre-ukraine-ammunition-production-nammo-norway
23,"Lawmakers in the US are moving forward with plans for a national ban on TikTok despite protests from users like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The ban is driven by concerns over national security and China's access to user data. TikTok's CEO denied spying allegations but faced criticism. Despite efforts to address concerns, lawmakers are determined to restrict the app. The situation remains fluid, with legislation being considered to give legal authority for a ban.","Lawmakers have said theyâre moving forward with plans for a national ban on TikTok, as users including Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez take to the app to protest. The snowballing effort to take action against TikTok comes after company chief Shou Zi Chew appeared before a US House committee for five hours on Thursday, where lawmakers from both parties grilled him about national security and other concerns involving the app. Following the hearing, Ocasio-Cortez made her first ever TikTok to speak out against a potential ban â highlighting the unprecedented nature of such an action. Meanwhile, thousands of video edits flooded the app making fun of moments in the hearing. Young users have skewered politicians as out of touch for questions about TikTokâs technology. âThis is the most boomer thing I have ever seen,â one caption reads on a video of a member of Congress accusing TikTok of tracking usersâ pupil dilation. The grassroots social media effort highlights a tension between the appâs growing popularity and lawmakersâ push to ban it. TikTok now has more than 150 million users in the US. Despite the protests, authorities appear set on pushing ahead with restricting the platform. On Sunday, Kevin McCarthy, the US House of Representatives speaker, said lawmakers will move forward with legislation to address national security concerns about TikTok, alleging Chinaâs government has had access to the appâs user data. In the United States, there are growing calls to ban TikTok, owned by China-based company ByteDance, or to pass bipartisan legislation to give Joe Bidenâs administration legal authority to seek a ban. Devices owned by the US government were recently banned from having the app installed. âThe House will be moving forward with legislation to protect Americans from the technological tentacles of the Chinese Communist Party,â McCarthy said on Twitter. In Thursdayâs hearing, the TikTok CEO was asked if of the app has spied on Americans at Beijingâs request. âNo,â Chew said. Outside of the hearing, a group of more than 30 content creators protested the potential ban, holding signs that said âKeep TikTok.â Republican congressman Neal Dunn referenced the companyâs disclosure in December that some China-based employees at ByteDance improperly accessed TikTok user data of two journalists and were no longer employed by the company. He repeated his question about whether ByteDance was spying. âI donât think that spying is the right way to describe it,â Chew said. He went on to describe the reports as involving an âinternal investigationâ before being cut off. Speaker McCarthy, a Republican, said in a tweet on Sunday, âItâs very concerning that the CEO of TikTok canât be honest and admit what we already know to be true â China has access to TikTok user data.â The company says it has spent more than $1.5bn on data security efforts under a planned dubbed âProject Texasâ, which aims to alleviate lawmakersâ concerns by relocating all US user data to centers outside of China, through a partnership with the Texas-based firm Oracle. But rather than appease lawmakersâ concerns, Chewâs appearance before Congress on Thursday âactually increased the likelihood that Congress will take some actionâ, Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, the Republican chair of the House select committee on the Chinese Communist party, told ABC News on Sunday.

24,"Several countries, including the US, UK, and France, have forbidden government officials from using TikTok due to concerns about Chinese ownership and data privacy. The US is considering legislation, the Restrict Act, to review and prohibit transactions with foreign adversaries in the digital sector. TikTok's CEO faced skepticism in a congressional hearing, and the app's addictive nature and surveillance practices raise public health concerns. Banning TikTok may have political and demographic implications, given its popularity among Gen Z and Gen Y users.","As of this moment, government officials in 11 countries are forbidden to run TikTok on their government-issued phones. The countries include the US, Canada, Denmark, Belgium, the UK, New Zealand, Norway, France, the Netherlands and Poland. In addition, European Commission and European parliament staff were required to delete the app. This raises two questions. First, why were politicians and senior officials in democracies scrolling like zombies through dance crazes, daft pet videos, feeling âbonitaâ and things you can do with smudged lipstick? And second, what took these governments so long? After all, itâs never been a secret that TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese tech giant based in Beijing. Nor is it a secret that in the Peopleâs Republic of China all corporations bend to Xi Jinpingâs will. So anything that TikTok gets to know about its users can, ultimately, also be known by the Chinese regime, right down to Matt Hancockâs dance routines. Even Donald Trump understood that, which is why he launched a half-arsed attempt to âorderâ ByteDance to sell TikTok to a US company within 90 days. Like most Trump initiatives, this one was dead on arrival. But the political impetus to âdo somethingâ about TikTok has reached fever pitch under the Biden administration and last week led to TikTokâs CEO, Shou Zi Chew, being dragged before Congress to persuade legislators that, while ByteDance may own TikTok, it doesnât call the shots. It was a hard sell and Chew didnât close the deal. His line was that TikTok had a plan â âProject Texasâ â to store US usersâ data in Texas. Given that it is hard to think of an American data repository that has not been penetrated by Chinese hackers, this reassured no one. More importantly, though, when an official Chinese spokesman said, during the hearing, that his government would âfirmly opposeâ any forced sale of TikTok, it was clear that Chew was the monkey, not the organ-grinder, in this story. So we can expect political pressure to ban TikTok to increase until the associated rhetoric runs up against demographic and, possibly, electoral realities. Itâs one thing to stop government officials from zombie scrolling, but more than 500 million Gen Z and Gen Y kids are addicted to the app and are likely to be infuriated if deprived of their online fixes by boomers whose economic policies have screwed their hopes of ever owning a home. And â who knows? â one day those disaffected cohorts might even go to polling stations and vote. Similar considerations might give pause to legislators in other polities who are contemplating a general ban on TikTok. But, for the US at least, the app is a sideshow in a much bigger game. The countryâs rulers are in the grip of hegemonic panic â increasingly rattled by the emergence of China as a rival superpower that is determined to reshape the US-dominated, postwar global order. And they are determined to prevent that happening. A key element in US strategy is to deny China mastery of digital technology. The legislative tool for achieving that goal is âthe Restrict (Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology) actâ, a bill that is on its way through Congress. The bill goes well beyond banning TikTok or sanctioning Huawei. It empowers the president and executive branch (specifically, the US Department of Commerce) to act swiftly with legal empowerment from Congress, which avoids the fiasco of Trumpâs previous attempt to ban TikTok and WeChat. The aims of the bill are astonishingly broad: âTo authorize the Secretary of Commerce to review and prohibit certain transactions between persons in the United States and foreign adversaries, and for other purposes.â The list of technologies includes nearly everything that one might list under the general heading of âdigitalâ. Unusually in the current fractured politics of the US, the bill has strong bipartisan support and the White House is backing it. So itâs likely to become law fairly soon. If it does, says Kevin Xu, a shrewd observer of these things, itâs âgame overâ for all Chinese technology companies seeking to do business in the US. All of which rather puts TikTok in context. But, as it happens, there are good public health grounds for banning the app â notably its pathologically addictive properties and its ultra-detailed surveillance of its users. If in doubt, just watch your teenage kids when theyâre on it: itâs basically Instagram on steroids. But if we were to ban TikTok, shouldnât we then also ban all social media apps that rely on algorithmic curation for their revenues?

25,"During a congressional hearing, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew defended the company's relationship with China and its privacy practices. Lawmakers expressed concerns over China's influence on the app and the potential accessibility of user data by the Chinese government. Chew asserted that TikTok is not an agent of China and stated that the company collects less data than its peers. In other news, the US conducted airstrikes on an Iran-backed group in Syria in response to a deadly attack on a coalition base. Two women provided testimony to the US Congress about their experiences in Chinese ""re-education camps"" in Xinjiang, describing harsh conditions and human rights abuses.","Good morning. The chief executive of TikTok, Shou Zi Chew, was forced to defend his companyâs relationship with China, as well as the protections for its youngest users, at a testy congressional hearing on Thursday that came amid a bipartisan push to ban the app entirely in the US over national security concerns. The hearing marked the first appearance before US lawmakers by a TikTok chief executive, and a rare public outing for the 40-year-old Chew, who has remained largely out of the limelight as the social networkâs popularity soars. TikTok boasts tens of millions of US users, but lawmakers have long held concerns over Chinaâs control over the app, which Chew repeatedly tried to assuage throughout the hearing. âLet me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,â Chew said in his testimony. Questioning got off to a forceful start with members of the committee hammering Chew on his connection to executives at TikTokâs parent company, ByteDance, who lawmakers say have ties to the Chinese Communist party. The committee members asked how frequently Chew was in contact with them, and questioned whether the companyâs proposed solutions to US data security concerns would offer sufficient protection against Chinese laws that require companies to make user data accessible to the government. What are the key takeaways from TikTok hearing in Congress? Chew defended TikTokâs privacy practices, stating they are are in line with those of other social media platforms, adding that in many cases the app collects less data than its peers. âThere are more than 150 million Americans who love our platform, and we know we have a responsibility to protect them,â Chew said. Here are some of the other key criticisms Chew faced at yesterdayâs landmark hearing, and what could lie ahead. US strikes Iran-backed group in Syria after deadly attack on coalition base The US has carried out airstrikes on an Iran-backed group in Syria, after an American contractor was killed when a suspected Iranian-made drone attacked a coalition base in the countryâs north-east. Five US service members and one other US contractor were wounded in the attack on Thursday, the Pentagon said. In a statement released later on Thursday, the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said US Central Command forces retaliated against the attack with âprecision airstrikesâ against facilities in eastern Syria used by groups affiliated with Iranâs Revolutionary Guard. Did the strikes kill anyone? Yes. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported: âUS strikes targeted a weapons depots inside Deir ez-Zor city, killing six pro-Iran fighters, and two other fighters were killed by strikes targeting the desert of Mayadine and near al-Boukamal.â âLike a war zoneâ: Congress hears of Chinaâs abuses in Xinjiang âre-education campsâ Two women who say they experienced and escaped Chinese âre-education campsâ have provided first-hand testimony to members of the US Congress, giving harrowing detail while imploring Americans not to look away from what the US has declared a continuing genocide of Muslim ethnic minorities. Testifying before a special House committee at the beginning of Ramadan, Gulbahar Haitiwaji, a Uyghur woman, said that during her nearly three years in internment camps and police stations, prisoners were subjected to 11 hours of âbrainwashing educationâ each day. It included singing patriotic songs and praising the Chinese government before and after meals. Haitiwaji said detainees were punished for speaking in Uyghur and endured routine interrogations during which they were hooded and shackled to their chairs. On one occasion, she said, she was chained to her bed for 20 days. Female prisoners were told they would be vaccinated, when they were being sterilized. âThere are cameras all over the camp,â Haitiwaji said. âOur every move was monitored.â What did the other woman say? Qelbinur Sidik, a member of Chinaâs ethnic Uzbek minority who is now a human rights activist living in the Netherlands, told of being coerced by Chinese authorities into teaching classes at one of Chinaâs internment camps. Through a translator, she described the detention facilities as âlike a war zoneâ with razor wire fencing and armed guards. Sidik recalled hearing the âhorrible screaming soundsâ of Uyghur prisoners as they were tortured. In other news â¦ The governor of Utah, Spencer Cox, has signed sweeping legislation requiring explicit parental permissions for anyone under 18 to use platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. He also signed a bill prohibiting social media companies from employing techniques that could cause minors to develop an âaddictionâ to the platforms. The families of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira have voiced frustration and anger after the preliminary court hearings of three of their alleged murderers had to be suspended in Brazil because of poor internet and logistical problems at the high-security prisons where the defendants are being held.

Stat of the day: Majority of trans adults are happier after transitioning, survey finds A large majority of transgender adults say that transitioning has made them more satisfied with their life, according to a survey. The survey, conducted by the Washington Post and KFF, is the largest nongovernmental survey of transgender adults that uses random samplings. The questionnaire found that a majority of transgender adults are happier after transitioning, with 78% of respondents noting that living as a gender outside the one assigned at birth has increased their satisfaction in life, reported the Washington Post. More than four out of 10 adults noted that they are âa lot moreâ satisfied. While overall rates of life satisfaction among trans adults were lower than the general population, many survey participants said that was largely due to discrimination facing trans people. Donât miss this: Ethical no manâs land â can the US supreme court be trusted to police itself? The nationâs highest court relies on justices to judge for themselves if they have a conflict of interest. Often members of the hard-right majority decide they donât. Last July, Samuel Alito, one of the nine justices of the US supreme court, delivered the keynote speech at a gala dinner held at the Palazzo Colonna in Rome. The justice had been flown out to Rome by the Religious Liberty Initiative, an outpost of the University of Notre Dame law school that advocates for religious freedom informed by the Catholic tradition. This was not the groupâs first contact with Alito. The initiative and its faculty have filed amicus briefs with the supreme court in at least six high-profile cases since it was founded in 2020. Two of the groupâs fellows filed amicus briefs arguing against the constitutional right to an abortion in Dobbs, the case that led to the court overturning Roe v Wade in a contentious ruling written by Alito. â¦ or this: âThese are my stomping groundsâ â the first Black-owned bookstore opens in Octavia Butlerâs home town Books are strewn everywhere and are awaiting their turn to be shuffled into their assigned nooks in tall black shelves, writes Jireh Deng.

Climate check: Cargo ships powered by wind could help tackle climate crisis Cars, trucks and planes get plenty of blame for helping drive the climate crisis, but shipping produces a large portion of the worldâs greenhouse gases, as well as nitrogen oxides and sulphur pollution because ships largely use cheap heavy fuel oil. Itâs been a struggle to clean up the shipping industry but one solution is to use wind-powered ships. That may seem like going back to the days of the Cutty Sark, but new hi-tech wind-propulsion can be fitted to existing ships to cut fuel use, supplying between 10% and 90% of a shipâs power needs, depending on where on the ocean they are and which weather patterns they harness. Wind is free, blows harder at sea than on land and weather-routing software uses sophisticated algorithms to plot the fastest and most fuel-efficient voyage.

TikTok's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, defended the company's relationship with China and addressed concerns over user protection and national security at a congressional hearing. Lawmakers questioned Chew on ties to Chinese executives, data security, and the platform's impact on mental health. Chew emphasized TikTok's independence and efforts to address concerns, such as data localization. The hearing reflected bipartisan support for banning TikTok, reminiscent of Mark Zuckerberg's testimony. TikTok faces challenges due to its popularity and safety issues, but critics argue that other big tech firms should also be held accountable.","The chief executive of TikTok, Shou Zi Chew, was forced to defend his companyâs relationship with China, as well as the protections for its youngest users, at a testy congressional hearing on Thursday that came amid a bipartisan push to ban the app entirely in the US over national security concerns.

The committee members asked how frequently Chew was in contact with them, and questioned whether the companyâs proposed solutions to US data security concerns would offer sufficient protection against Chinese laws that require companies to make user data accessible to the government. Chewâs claims of independence from the Chinese government were undermined by a Wall Street Journal story published just hours before the hearing that said China would strongly oppose any forced sale of the company. Responding for the first time to Joe Bidenâs threat of a national ban unless ByteDance sells its shares, the Chinese commerce ministry said such a move would involve exporting technology from China and thus would have to be approved by the Chinese government. Lawmakers also questioned Chew, a former Goldman Sachs banker who has helmed the company since March 2021, over the platformâs impact on mental health, particularly of its young users. The Republican congressman Gus Bilirakis shared the story of Chase Nasca, a 16-year-old boy who killed himself a year ago by stepping in front of a train. Nascaâs parents, who have sued ByteDance, claiming Chase was âtargetedâ with unsolicited self-harm content, appeared at the hearing and grew emotional as Bilirakis told their sonâs story. âI want to thank his parents for being here today, and allowing us to show this,â Bilirakis said. âMr Chew, your company destroyed their lives.â Driving home concerns about young users, congresswoman Nanette BarragÃ¡n asked Chew about reports that he does not let his own children use the app. âAt what age do you think it would be appropriate for a young person to get on TikTok?â she said. Chew confirmed his own children were not on TikTok but said that was because in Singapore, where they live, there is not a version of the platform for users under the age of 13. Chew, who has kept a relatively low-profile during his two years as CEO, spent much of the five-hour hearing stressing TikTokâs distance from the Chinese government, kicking off his testimony with an emphasis on his own Singaporean heritage. Chew talked about Project Texas â an effort to move all US data to domestic servers â and said the company was deleting all US user data that is backed up to servers outside of the country by the end of the year. Some legislators expressed skepticism that Project Texas was too large an undertaking and would not tackle concerns about US data privacy soon enough. âI am concerned that what youâre proposing with Project Texas just doesnât have the technical capability of providing us the assurances that we need,â the California Republican Jay Obernolte, a software engineer, said. At one point, Tony CÃ¡rdenas, a Democrat from California, asked Chew outright if TikTok is a Chinese company. Chew responded that TikTok is global in nature, not available in mainland China, and headquartered in Singapore and Los Angeles. Neal Dunn, a Republican from Florida, asked with similar bluntness whether ByteDance has âspied on American citizensâ â a question that came amid reports the company had accessed journalistsâ information in an attempt to identify which employees leaked information. Chew responded that âspying is not the right way to describe itâ. The hearing comes three years after TikTok was formally targeted by the Trump administration with an executive order prohibiting US companies from doing business with ByteDance. Biden revoked that order in June 2021, under the stipulation that the US committee on foreign investment conduct a review of the company. When that review stalled, Biden demanded TikTok sell its Chinese-owned shares or face a ban in the US. This bipartisan nature of the backlash was remarked upon several times during the hearing, with CÃ¡rdenas pointing out that Chew âhas been one of the few people to unite this committeeâ. Chewâs testimony, some lawmakers said, was reminiscent of Mark Zuckerbergâs appearance in an April 2018 hearing to answer for his own platformâs data-privacy issues â answers many lawmakers were unsatisfied with. CÃ¡rdenas said: âWe are frustrated with TikTok â¦ and yes, you keep mentioning that there are industry issues that not only TikTok faces but others. You remind me a lot of [Mark] Zuckerberg ... when he came here, I said he reminds me of Fred Astaire: a good dancer with words. And you are doing the same today. A lot of your answers are a bit nebulous, theyâre not yes or no.â Chew warned users in a video posted to TikTok earlier in the week that the company was at a âpivotal momentâ. âSome politicians have started talking about banning TikTok,â he said, adding that the app now has more than 150 million active monthly US users. âThatâs almost half the US coming to TikTok.â TikTok has battled legislative headwinds since its meteoric rise began in 2018. Today, a majority of teens in the US say they use TikTok â with 67% of people ages 13 to 17 saying they have used the app and 16% of that age group saying they use it âalmost constantlyâ, according to the Pew Research Center. This has raised a number of concerns about the appâs impact on young usersâ safety, with self-harm and eating disorder-related content spreading on the platform. TikTok is also facing lawsuits over deadly âchallengesâ that have gone viral on the app. TikTok has introduced features in response to such criticisms, including automatic time limits for users under 18. Some tech critics have said that while TikTokâs data collection does raise concerns, its practices are not much different from those of other big tech firms. âHolding TikTok and China accountable are steps in the right direction, but doing so without holding other platforms accountable is simply not enough,â said the Tech Oversight Project, a technology policy advocacy organization, in a statement. âLawmakers and regulators should use this weekâs hearing as an opportunity to re-engage with civil society organizations, NGOs, academics and activists to squash all of big techâs harmful practices.â",Guardian,23/03/2023,"TikTok CEO grilled for over five hours on China, drugs and teen mental health",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/23/tiktok-shou-zi-chew-congress

Chew responded that âspying is not the right way to describe itâ. Concerns about the viability of âProject Texasâ In an effort to deflect concerns about Chinese influence, TikTok has pledged to relocate all US user data to domestic servers through an effort titled Project Texas, a plan that would also allow US tech firm Oracle to scrutinize TikTokâs source code and act as a third-party monitor. The company has promised to complete the effort by the end of the year, but some lawmakers questioned whether that is possible, with hundreds of millions of lines of source code requiring review in a relatively short amount of time. âI am concerned that what youâre proposing with Project Texas just doesnât have the technical capability of providing us the assurances that we need,â the California Republican Jay Obernolte, a congressman and software engineer, said. Youth safety and mental health in the spotlight Another frequent focus was the safety of TikTokâs young users, considering the app has exploded in popularity with this age group in recent years. A majority of teens in the US say they use TikTok â with 67% of people aged 13 to 17 saying they have used the app and 16% of that age group saying they use it âalmost constantlyâ, according to the Pew Research Center. Lawmakers cited reports that drug-related content has spread on the app, allowing teens to purchase dangerous substances easily online. Chew said such content violates TikTok policy and that they are removed when identified. âWe take this very seriously,â Chew said. âThis is an industry-wide challenge, and weâre investing as much as we can. We donât think it represents the majority of the usersâ experience on TikTok, but it does happen.â Others cited self-harm and eating disorder content, which have been spreading on the platform. TikTok is also facing lawsuits over deadly âchallengesâ that have gone viral on the app. Mental health concerns were underscored at the hearing by the appearance of Dean and Michelle Nasca, the parents of a teen who died by suicide after allegedly being served unsolicited self-harm content on TikTok. âWe need you to do your part,â said congresswoman Kim Schrier, who is a pediatrician. âIt could save this generation.â Uncertainty lingers over a possible ban The federal government has already barred TikTok on government devices, and the Biden administration has threatened a national ban. Thursdayâs hearing left the future of the app in the US uncertain, as members of the committee appeared unwavering in their conviction that TikTok was a tool that could be exploited by the Chinese Communist party. Their conviction was bolstered by a report in the Wall Street Journal, released just hours before the hearing, indicating the Chinese government would not approve a sale of TikTok. Lawmakers outside of the committee are also unconvinced. US senators Mark Warner and John Thune said in a statement that all Chinese companies âare ultimately required to do the bidding of Chinese intelligence services, should they be called upon to do soâ and that nothing Chew said in his testimony assuaged those concerns. Colorado senator Michael Bennet also reiterated calls for an all-out ban of TikTok. But the idea of a national ban still faces huge hurdles, both legally and in the court of public opinion. For one, previous attempts to ban TikTok under the Trump administration was blocked in court due in part to free speech concerns. TikTok also remains one of the fastest growing and most popular apps in the US and millions of its users are unlikely to want to give it up. A coalition of civil liberties, privacy and security groups including Fight for the Future, the Center for Democracy and Technology, and the American Civil Liberties Union have written a letter opposing a ban, arguing that it would violate constitutional rights to freedom of expression. âA nationwide ban on TikTok would have serious ramifications for free expression in the digital sphere, infringing on Americansâ first amendment rights and setting a potent and worrying precedent in a time of increased censorship of internet users around the world,â the letter reads. Where the coalition and many members of the House committee agree is on the pressing need for federal data privacy regulation that protects consumer information and reins in all big tech platforms, including TikTok. The American Data Privacy Act â a bipartisan bill working its way through Washington â is one effort under way to address those concerns.",Guardian,23/03/2023,Key takeaways from TikTok hearing in Congress â and the uncertain road ahead,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/23/key-takeaways-tiktok-hearing-congress-shou-zi-chew

During the congressional hearing, lawmakers expressed concerns about TikTok's ties to the Chinese government and its potential to compromise user data. Some senators called for a ban on the app, while others highlighted the need for federal data privacy regulations. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew defended the company's practices and promised to relocate US user data to servers outside of China. Safety issues related to harmful content and drug-related videos on TikTok were also discussed.","With that, the blog is closed for today. Please see our full summary of the hearing here, and thanks for reading! Whatâs next for TikTok? Itâs hard to know where we go from here. Members of the committee appeared unwavering in their conviction that TikTok was a tool that could be exploited by the CCP â a conviction that was ultimately bolstered by todayâs WSJ report indicating the Chinese government would not approve a sale of TikTok. Lawmakers outside of the committee are also unconvinced. US Senators Mark R Warner and John Thune said in a statement that all Chinese companies âare ultimately required to do the bidding of Chinese intelligence services, should they be called upon to do soâ and that nothing Chew said in his testimony assuaged those concerns. Colorado Senator Michael Bennet reiterated calls for an all out ban of TikTok, saying that Chewâs testimony is a departure from what Chew told Bennet in a private meeting weeks prior to the hearing. âWhen he was in my office, the CEO admitted to me that my interpretation of Chinese law was correct, which was that any time the CPP wanted to say: weâre going to have the data turned over, that ByteDance, and therefore TikTok, had a legal obligation to turn that data over. Now heâs saying something different in his testimony to the committee.â But a coalition of civil liberties, privacy and security groups including Fight for the Future, the Center for Democracy and Technology and the American Civil Liberties Union have written a letter opposing a ban, arguing that it would violate constitutional rights to freedom of expression. âIf passed by Congress and enacted into law, a nationwide ban on TikTok would have serious ramifications for free expression in the digital sphere, infringing on Americansâ First Amendment rights and setting a potent and worrying precedent in a time of increased censorship of internet users around the world,â the letter reads. Where the coalition and many members of the House committee agree is that there is a pressing need for a federal data privacy regulation that protects consumer information. Multiple members of the House committee on energy and commerce mentioned a proposed federal bipartisan privacy bill, the American Data Privacy Act, and the need for such a regulation to rein in TikTok. The coalition agrees: federal regulations could address the data-privacy issues the entire tech industry shares with TikTok. âA comprehensive consumer privacy bill would limit data commodification, thereby dramatically increasing usersâ security online. A robust privacy bill could address concerns not just at TikTok but across the multiple social media platforms,â the letter continues. Thatâs a wrap: key takeaways from todayâs hearing The first appearance in Congress for TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew stretched more than five hours, with contentious questioning targeting the appâs relationship with China and protections for its youngest users. Here are some key themes focused on today. TikTokâs relationship to China Many members of the committee focused in on TikTokâs parent company ByteDance and executives there who lawmakers say have ties to the Chinese Communist party. The committee members asked how frequently Chew was in contact with them, and questioned whether the companyâs proposed solution, called Project Texas, would offer sufficient protection against Chinese laws that require companies to make user data accessible to the government. At one point, Tony CÃ¡rdenas, a Democrat from California, asked Chew outright if TikTok is a Chinese company. Chew responded that TikTok is global in nature, not available in mainland China, and headquartered in Singapore and Los Angeles. Neal Dunn, a Republican from Florida, asked with similar bluntness whether ByteDance has âspied on American citizensâ â a question that came amid reports the company accessed journalistsâ information in an attempt to identify which employees were leaking information. Chew responded that âspying is not the right way to describe itâ. Project Texas and user data In an effort to deflect concerns about Chinese influence, TikTok has pledged to relocate all US user data to servers outside of China through an effort titled Project Texas. The company has promised to complete the effort by the end of the year, but some lawmakers questioned whether that is possible, with hundreds of millions of lines of source code requiring review in a relatively short amount of time. âI am concerned that what youâre proposing with Project Texas just doesnât have the technical capability of providing us the assurances that we need,â the California Republican Jay Obernolte, a software engineer, said. Youth safety on TikTok Another frequent focus of todayâs hearing was safety of TikTokâs young users, as the app has exploded in popularity with the age group in recent years. Today, a majority of teens in the US say they use TikTok â with 67% of people ages 13 to 17 saying they have used the app and 16% of that age group saying they use it âalmost constantlyâ, according to the Pew Research Center. Lawmakers cited reports that drug-related content has spread on the app, allowing teens to purchase dangerous substances easily online. Chew said such content violates TikTok policy and that they are removed when identified. âWe take this very seriously,â Chew said. âThis is an industry-wide challenge, and weâre investing as much as we can. We donât think it represents the majority of the usersâ experience on TikTok, but it does happen.â Others cited self-harm, and eating disorder content have been spreading on the platform. TikTok is also facing lawsuits over deadly âchallengesâ that have gone viral on the app. âWe need you to do your part,â said congresswoman Kim Schrier, who is a pediatrician. âIt could save this generation.â Todayâs hearing stretched over five hours and included some tense exchanges on everything from TikTokâs relationship to China to the safeguarding of young users. Here are some of the most striking images: And with that, the hearing has come to a close. Stay tuned for some key takeaways from the congressional grilling of TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew that lasted over five hours. Hereâs video of a key moment from earlier in the hearing. Republican Kat Cammack showed Congress a TikTok video inciting violence towards the House energy and commerce committee, with the chair of the committee named in the captions. The video was uploaded to the platform 41 days ago and was still circulating despite company guidelines assuring users it would take down threatening content. Shou Zi Chew was denied a chance to respond to Cammackâs claims by the chair. The video was removed from TikTok during the hearing. Several Congress members took the opportunity on Thursday to question Chew about drug concerns on TikTok. Angie Craig of Minnesota referenced a Washington Post report from earlier this month that showed drugs are easily accessible on the platform. âWhat are you going to do to move past these token efforts to prevent teenagers from accessing drugs on your platform?â she asked. In the past TikTok has directed users who search certain drug-related hashtags, like âfentanylâ to resource pages. Craig suggested that users seeking drugs would likely not use hashtags, and that dealers are able to bypass such measures using different hashtag spellings and emojis. âWe do take illegal illegal drugs content on our platform very seriously â it violates our guidelines,â Chew said. He added that the company is working to more proactively find drug-related content. Rick Allen also questioned Chew about drug-related content on TikTok, noting a 2021 investigation from the Wall Street Journal that revealed the app served an account purporting to be 13 years old more than 500 videos about drug use. Chew said such content violates TikTok policy and that they are removed when identified. âWe take this very seriously,â he said. âThis is an industry-wide challenge, and weâre investing as much as we can. We donât think it represents the majority of the usersâ experience on TikTok, but it does happen.â Upon return from break, Congress questioning continued to take a harsh tone, hours into a grilling of Chew. Texas representative Randy Weber was aggressive with his time on the floor, accusing TikTok of âindoctrinatingâ American kids with âdivisive, woke, and pro-CCP contentâ. âIf this committee gets its way, TikTokâs time is up,â he said. Shortly after, Morgan Griffith of Virginia accused TikTok of being an agent of the Chinese Communist party as well. âIs it part of the Chinese Communist party as everybody thinks, or are you still living in some mystical world?â he asked. We are back in session, with testy questioning from Congress continuing. Stay tuned for more. The hearing has entered recess and will reconvene in a bit. Stand by for updates. Congresswoman Kim Schrier, who is a pediatrician, asked Chew a number of questions about TikTokâs impact on young usersâ health. The issue has been a central concern in todayâs hearing, which is titled TikTok: How Congress Can Safeguard American Data Privacy and Protect Children from Online Harms. Schrier said TikTok has been particularly dangerous for children during the pandemic, when social media was already replacing in-person interactions. âSocial media is designed to be addicting, and your platform is the most addictive of all,â she said. âAnd this endless, mindless scrolling takes teams away from human relationships.â She added that TikTok is keeping teens awake âwell past their bedtimesâ at a time when âsleep is critical for brain and physical developmentâ. She also noted that there is a large amount of harmful content on the app encouraging eating disorders. Chew said TikTok has worked with experts to tackle such content and is building models to identify and remove it more quickly. âAnything that glorifies eating disorders we remove,â he said. âItâs something we take very seriously.â Previous Guardian reporting showed that hashtags promoting eating disorders frequently evaded bans on TikTok. Teens attempting to recover from disordered eating described being trapped in algorithmic bubbles that fed them dangerous content. Schrier encouraged Chew to expedite responses to these concerns. âWe need you to do your part,â she said. âIt could save this generation.â Republican representative Neal Dunn of Florida outright asked: âHas ByteDance spied on American citizens?â The question comes after reports emerged in 2022 that the company accessed location data of reporters in an attempt to identify which employees were leaking information. Chew responded that âspying is not the right way to describe itâ. Driving home concerns about young users on TikTok, Congresswoman Nanette BarragÃ¡n asked Chew about reports that he does not let his own children use the app. âAt what age do you think it would be appropriate for a young person to get on TikTok?â she said. Chew said his children are not on TikTok because in Singapore, where they live, there is not a version of the platform for users under the age of 13. In the US there is a version of âTikTok for Younger Usersâ in which the content is curated for a younger audience. âOur approach is to give differentiated experiences for different age groups and let the parents have conversations with their children to decide whatâs best for their family,â he said. California Republican Jay Obernolte, who is a software engineer, asked a series of technical questions of Chew relating to how TikTok plans to manage US user data in the future. The questions related to Project Texas â an effort TikTok is carrying out to relocate all US user data to domestic servers. As part of the project, US tech firm Oracle is going through lines of TikTok source code â a massive undertaking. âI am concerned that what youâre proposing with Project Texas just doesnât have the technical capability of providing us the assurances that we need,â Obernolte said. Obernolte said that concerns raised by TikTok are not unique to the Chinese company and called for better protections for Americans. âSocial media companies gather a tremendous amount of user data and then use powerful AI tools to use that data to make really accurate predictions of human behavior, and then seek to manipulate that behavior,â he said. âThatâs not just TikTok â itâs all social media companies that are doing this. Ultimately, the solution is to enact comprehensive federal data privacy legislation that will prevent that kind of behavior, or at least allow users to consent to it.â US representative Tony CÃ¡rdenas, a Democrat from California, asked the CEO outright if TikTok is a Chinese company. Chew said TikTok is global in nature, not available in mainland China, and headquartered in Singapore and Los Angeles. CÃ¡rdenas again underscored the bipartisan nature of todayâs hearing. âYou have been one of the few members to unite this committee,â he told Chew. Kari Paul here on the west coast, taking over the blog for the remainder of Chewâs hearing. Stand by for updates. The hearing is now in recess. As expected, two hours into the hearing weâre still hitting on a lot of the same questions. Does the CCP control TikTok decisions, either directly or indirectly? How does TikTok get around CCP laws that require companies provide access to user data? How does the company plan to alleviate the harmful impacts of its platform on teen mental health? It doesnât appear many lawmakers are interested in hearing Chewâs response and in some cases rarely give him the opportunity to fully respond to their questions. That said, Chew is also repeating much of the same lines from his opening testimony when responding to questions. The WSJ report today, which has been cited by members of the committee at least three times, has not helped Chew at all given the impression lawmakers have from that story is that China would have control over whether or not ByteDance could be sold. Members have also used this hearing as an opportunity to promote their efforts to pass a federal privacy bill that limits how user data is collected and shared. Two moments have stood out as potentially damaging to Chewâs testimony. First, when Cammack pulled up a TikTok post that appeared to threaten the committee and the committee chair that had not been taken down by the company 41 days after it was first posted. Second, when Gus Bilirakis shared the story of Chase Nasca who died by suicide. Bilirakis alleged that it was TikTok content that lead him to do that and then proceeded to play a series of videos that discussed suicide. Representative Brett Guthrie goes back to the threatening video that Cammack presented and asks why and how itâs been up for 41 days. âWe had a threat against our committee â¦ you seem to be able to prevent this content in China â¦ and yet itâs on your website,â Guthrie said. âYou said earlier as soon as you find this information you take it down. How quickly does your algorithm detect keywords or content that involve illicit drug trafficking before these posts are self-reported or used by others? Chew says there are 40,000 moderators working on this, alongside automated systems â¦ but no company can be perfect. Guthrie is expressing confusion on why Douyin, the ByteDance-owned China-based version of TikTok, is able to stamp out illicit drugs content entirely but TikTok isnât able to do that. Chew said you have to deal with the reality of the country youâre operating in, but that itâs a shared challenge with other tech companies in the US. Essentially drug laws arenât as strict here as it is in China. Representative John Sarbanes is asking whether TikTok is looking into how to make its platform less âmanipulativeâ. Chew said the company was the first to implement the 60-minute watch limit and also prohibits users under 16 to use direct messages. Users under 16 also canât go viral by design, Chew said. But Sarbanes points out that teens have been able to bypass the 60-minute time limit. âIf you concluded that putting some reasonable limits in place â¦ would lead some percentage of your users to leave TikTok and go somewhere else is that something youâre prepared to accept?â Chew said yes. Lawmakers are focusing more on teen and children mental health on TikTok now. Representative Gus Bilirakis shares a story of Chase Nasca, a 16-year-old boy who ended his life a year ago by stepping in front of a train. âI want to thank his parents for being here today, and allowing us to show this,â Bilirakis said. âMr Chew your company destroyed their lives. I admire their courage to be here and share Chaseâs story in the hopes itâll prevent this from happening to other families. The content in Chaseâs âFor Youâ page wasnât a window to discovery â¦ instead his âFor Youâ page was sadly a window to discover suicide. It is unacceptable, sir, that even after knowing all these dangers you still [contend] TikTok is something grand to behold.â Bilirakis then played a series of TikToks that promote suicidal ideation. âDo you have responsibility over the algorithms used by TikTok to prioritize content for its users,â he asks Chew. In his answer, Chew attempted to emphasize that TikTok shares mental health resources but Bilirakis pushes him on the question, taking his attempts to address what TikTok is doing to help teen mental health as a means to avoid answering his question or accept responsibility. Representative Kat Cammack has presented a video that was posted 41 days ago that shows a gun being shot. The text over the video says âme ASF at the House Energy and Commerce Committeeâ¦â and the caption includes the name of the chair of the committee, Cathy McMorris Rodgers. âI think this is a blatant display of how vulnerable people who use TikTok are, you couldnât take action after 41 days when a clear threat, a very violent threat to the chairwoman of this committee and the members of this committee was posted on your platform,â Cammack said. âYou damn well know that you cannot protect the data and security of this committee or the 150 million users of your app because itâs an extension of the CCP.â The chair did not allow Chew to respond. Important to note that members of the committee have repeatedly tried to establish Chewâs connection with ByteDance executives â some of whom, they say, work with or are affiliated with the CCP. Representative Diana DeGette is bringing up the WSJ report again and asking Chew for comment. He said that heâd have to get back to them because whether ByteDance would be forced to sell TikTok is still developing so he doesnât have specifics but that Project Texas would protect US users no matter what. âDoes TikTok share user information â¦ overseas?â Degette asked. Chew said in the past, yes but with Project Texas that would no longer be the case. He reiterated that the efforts to protect user data through Project Texas is more than any other company has done. Representative Richard Hudson asked Chew about the reports that ByteDance employees have accessed user data of US journalists in order to investigate an internal leak of information. Chew says TikTok condemns this behavior. âWe took swift disciplinary action against employees and are implementing measures to make sure this doesnât happen again,â he said. Representative Anna Eshoo has asked how TikTok could get around Beijingâs security laws that require companies to provide data to the government and makes the reach of the law âextra-territorialâ. âThis is very clear,â Eshoo said. âThose are the laws of the PRC, how does TikTok convince the congress of the US that there can be a clean break? Why would the Chinese government sidestep their national law â¦ in terms of user data?â Chew reiterated the plan is to move American data to American soil. Eshoo is not satisfied: âHow can you promise the data will move to the US and be protected here?â Chew said he has seen no evidence that the Chinese government has access to our data. âThey havenât asked us,â he said. Eshoo said she doesnât believe thereâs a private sector in China. âWhen you look at their national law â¦ I think there is a real problem relative to our national security about the protection of the user data.â Members of the committee have cited a Wall Street Journal report that indicates China would oppose a forced sale of TikTok. âChinaâs Commerce Ministry said Thursday that a sale or divestiture of TikTok would involve exporting technology and had to be approved by the Chinese government,â the article reads. Representative Michael Burgess said despite Chewâs assertions, China seems to believe its in control of TikTok and its software. Chew said that while TikTok is not available in mainland China, the founders of ByteDance are Chinese and they work with Chinese employees just like many companies around the world. Burgess has asked whether anyone from ByteDance âdirectly provide input, help or instruction for your testimony todayâ. Chew said he prepared for this hearing with his team in DC. As a reminder, ByteDance is TikTokâs parent company. Pallone said that he doesnât believe Project Texas is sufficient and that the CCP will still be able to access data. Now heâs asking about some of TikTokâs financials including how much money the company makes off of targeted ads. Chew refuses to share it because the company is private and thus its financials are also private. âMy concern here is primarily about the privacy issue the fact that TikTok is making all kinds of money by gathering private information about Americans â¦ and then they sell it,â Pallone said, bringing up the privacy legislation he and Rodgers are pushing. âWould you commit to not selling data to anyone?â Chew said the company doesnât sell data to data brokers, Pallone says he is talking about selling or sharing data to anyone. Chew said heâll get back to him on the details. Chew said the company is committed to being transparent about data they collect and that he doesnât believe the company collects any more data than any other tech platform. Pallone said that heâs not his point: He knows all tech companies collect data he doesnât think they should and wants to see if Tiktok would commit to being a good actor and stop collecting data. Rodgers asked Chew whether he has regular contact with various executives at Bytedance. He said he was in regular contact with the parent companyâs CEO. âAll of these individuals work or are affiliated with the Chinese Communist party and are at the highest levels of leadership of ByteDance,â Rodgers responded. âA company where you previously served as CFO and where you regularly communicate with the CEO.â Shou Zi Chew, TikTokâs CEO, is beginning his testimony with an emphasis on his Singaporean heritage. He has tried this strategy before in a letter to lawmakers when he first took over the company. TikTok is run by a Singaporean based in Singapore, he wrote in that letter, and not beholden to the Chinese government. Chew is also emphasizing that the companyâs 150 million users in the US use the platform for various purposes that includes educational videos. To address the lawmakersâ national security concerns, Chew is talking about Project Texas â an effort to move all US data to domestic servers. He said the company is deleting all user data that is backed up to servers outside the US, and that it should all be deleted later this year. âTrust is about actions we take, we have to earn your trust with decisions we make â¦ the potential security, privacy â¦ concerns are not unique to us. We believe whatâs needed are clear transparent rules that address all tech companies,â Chew said. He ends with this: âThere are more than 150 million users who love our platform and we know we have a responsibility to protect them which is why I am making the following commitments to you and all our users: 1) We will keep safety, particularly for teenagers as a top priority for us. 2) We will firewall protected US data from unwanted foreign access 3) TikTok will remain a place for free expression and not be manipulated by any government 4) We will be transparent and we will give access to third-party independent monitors to remain accountable for our commitments.â Ranking member Frank Pallone, a Democrat of New Jersey, is focused more on the spread of misinformation on TikTok, and the platformâs impact on teen mental health. Heâs also taking this opportunity to speak to urge the passage of a bill that would create a federal privacy law that would reign in all of big techâs data-collection practices. Good morning, the hearing has started. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the chair of the House energy and commerce committee, spoke passionately about her concerns with TikTokâs parent company, ByteDance. The main thrust of her argument is that TikTok poses a âgrave threatâ from foreign influence on American life. She claims that China requires companies to allow the government to access its data, by design. Rodgers tells Chew that he has to not just answer to Congress but also to the American people. Good morning and welcome to our liveblog of todayâs interrogation of TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew by US Congress members. The panel, convened by the House committee on energy and commerce, will begin at 10am ET and is titled TikTok: How Congress Can Safeguard American Data Privacy And Protect Children From Online Harms. This marks the first appearance from a TikTok chief executive before US lawmakers. It comes as the political storm surrounding the China-owned social media platform intensifies, with the Biden administration threatening to ban the app entirely in the US. TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has long faced criticisms over the data it holds on US users â data that lawmakers fear could fall into the hands of the Chinese government. According to prepared statements shared in advance, Chew is anticipated to insist that TikTok has never, and would never, share US user data with the Chinese government, nor let the state manipulate what content is shown on the platform. âLet me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,â Chew said.

30,"Shou Zi Chew, the CEO of TikTok, faces challenges in ensuring the app's survival amid potential bans. Born in Singapore, Chew's academic and business journey led him to top positions. He served in the Singaporean army, obtained an economics degree from University College London, worked at Goldman Sachs, and gained an MBA from Harvard. He joined venture capital firm DST, invested in ByteDance (TikTok's parent company), and became CFO of Xiaomi before joining ByteDance. Chew is now engaging in media efforts to prevent TikTok bans.","Shou Zi Chew has said the most gruelling experience of his life was a five-day survival course in the jungles of Borneo when he was serving as a conscript in Singaporeâs armed forces. The TikTok chief executive, whose trans-global academic and business career has rapidly propelled him to the top job at one of the worldâs biggest tech companies, will need to display some of that mettle as he battles to ensure the corporate survival of the controversial but immensely popular social video app. The 40-year-old Singaporean, who faces questioning by US lawmakers on Thursday amid talk of a possible ban in the US, came from a relatively modest background: his father worked in construction and mother in bookkeeping. His fate was transformed at the age of 12 when high marks on a national exam got him into an elite high school, where he added fluency in Mandarin to his native English. Following his military service â Chew is a reservist officer in the Singaporean army until he is 50 â he obtained a bachelorâs degree in economics from University College London. He stayed on in the UK capital, becoming a banker at Goldman Sachs for two years, investment experience that would eventually lead him to meet a young Zhang Yiming, the founder of TikTokâs parent, ByteDance, when he was developing the company in a crammed apartment in Beijingâs university district. In 2010, Chew gained his MBA from Harvard Business School, where he got his first experience of life in the tech sector with an internship at Facebook while the social networking company was still in startup mode before going public in 2012. It was also where he met his Taiwanese-American future wife Vivian Kao, with whom he has two children. Chew â whose TikTok profile was created in February last year and has just 23 posts, including videos of him attending the Super Bowl and NBA games as well as meeting celebrities such as Bill Murray â does not allow his children to use the app, having said last November that they are âtoo youngâ. After business school, Chew joined the venture capital firm DST, founded by the Israeli-Russian IT billionaire Yuri Milner, where his Mandarin qualified him to be its China-focused partner. This would see him make his pivotal visit to Zhangâs ByteDance in 2012 before the team created TikTok, resulting in Chew and his partners investing in the startup the following year. He also led investment in Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone maker with global ambitions to take on Apple, which he joined as chief financial officer in 2015 at the age of 32. Chew helped to secure financing that led to the companyâs public listing three years later. At the time this was one of Chinaâs biggest ever tech initial public offerings, although its share performance has since been mixed. He was made head of its international business in 2019. In 2021, Zhang persuaded Chew to join ByteDance as its first chief financial officer. Two months later, he was elevated to chief executive following the abrupt departure of the former Disney executive Kevin Mayer after just three months, as the Trump administration attempted to force a sale of TikTokâs US assets. Chewâs rise to the top of the tech industry landed him a spot on Fortuneâs 40 under 40 list in 2021. The low-profile exec is now embarking on a media offensive as part of TikTokâs wider efforts to galvanise support to avert a ban in the US and other countries. âThis could take TikTok away from all 150 million of you,â he said in a post appealing to US TikTok users.",Guardian,23/03/2023,From Facebook intern to the crosshairs of Congress: TikTok chiefâs stellar rise,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/23/tiktok-harvard-graduate-ceo-battles-us-market-shou-zi-chew
31,"The British Parliament has decided to ban TikTok from all parliamentary devices and the broader parliamentary network, citing cybersecurity concerns. This goes beyond the previous ban on government devices and will block access to TikTok over parliamentary WiFi. MPs who use TikTok on personal devices will also be affected. The ban comes as other countries, including the US and Scotland, have implemented similar restrictions due to privacy and tracking risks associated with the app.","Parliament is to ban the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok from âall parliamentary devices and the wider parliamentary networkâ, citing the need for cybersecurity. The move goes further than the ban last week of the app on government mobile phones and devices, covering the whole parliamentary network. That means that MPs and parliamentary staff who continue to have TikTok installed on personal devices will find the service blocked if they try to access it over parliamentary wifi. A parliament spokesperson said on Thursday: âFollowing the governmentâs decision to ban TikTok from government devices, the commissions of both the House of Commons and Lords have decided that TikTok will be blocked from all parliamentary devices and the wider parliamentary network. âCybersecurity is a top priority for parliament. However we do not comment on specific details of our cyber or physical security controls, policies or incidents.â Multiple MPs have been outspoken about their desire to continue posting on the social video app even in the wake of the governmentâs ban. Grant Shapps, the secretary of state for energy security, responded to the ban last week by posting a censored clip from the film Wolf of Wall Street, where Leonardo Dicaprioâs character exclaims âIâm not fucking leavingâ after deciding to fight the regulators. Other MPs on the platform include Conservatives Luke Evans and Marco Longhi, Labourâs Zarah Sultana, and the former health secretary Matt Hancock, who had the Conservative party whip suspended in 2022 for appearing on the TV programme Iâm a Celebrity. MPs including Shapps will continue to be able to post on the platform from their own personal devices, but not through parliament networks. The latest ban was announced while TikTokâs chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, was giving evidence to a committee of the US House of Representatives. An American decision to ban federal employees from installing TikTok on work devices kicked off a wave of similar bans around the world. The Scottish government has also banned TikTok from its mobile phones and other corporate devices following discussions with the UK government. Scotlandâs deputy first minister, John Swinney, said: âDevices managed by the Scottish government are configured in line with best practice from the National Cyber Security Centre, which helps us to manage any risk associated with the use of third-party applications. âOur decision to prohibit the use of TikTok follows engagement with the UK government on the potential tracking and privacy risks from certain social media apps. âCurrently there is limited use of TikTok within government and limited need for staff to use the app on work devices. This ban will be implemented immediately. It does not extend to personal devices used by staff or the general public.â",Guardian,23/03/2023,TikTok to be banned from UK parliamentary devices,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/23/tiktok-to-be-banned-from-uk-parliamentary-devices
32,"TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned social media platform, faces growing scrutiny and bans from several countries due to concerns over data security. Western governments worry that user data could be accessed by the Chinese government due to TikTok's ownership by ByteDance. While no hard evidence supports these claims, TikTok's aggressive data harvesting and previous incidents have raised suspicions. The possibility of a sale to address security concerns is complicated by TikTok's valuable intellectual property and potential price tag. A nationwide ban is uncertain but remains a possibility as geopolitical tensions between China and the West persist.","Good morning. Last year, TikTok was the most downloaded app in the world. It has a reported user base of more than a billion people and remains the fastest-growing social media platform since 2020. But now a succession of countries have banned it from government devices â with the UK announcing late last week it will join the US, the EU and New Zealand in imposing controls. Whether or not you actually use it, TikTokâs ubiquity has meant that many of us engage with video content that has originated from the app as it migrates across other platforms. Beyond the general criticisms aimed at TikTok â its addictive nature, its mysterious algorithm, its âshoppertainmentâ model â the Chinese-owned social media company has attracted a lot of attention from western governments who cite the app as a security issue. Despite its insistence that user data is safe, TikTok has been unable to assuage suspicions that have been brewing since its popularity exploded five years ago. Government officials in the west have maintained that its ownership by Chinese tech giant ByteDance puts sensitive user data at risk of being accessed by the Chinese government. And as geopolitical tensions between China and the US continue to grow, TikTok has found itself in the firing line. This shift could have huge repercussions for the social media giant â yesterday, it was reported that the BBC has urged its staff to delete the app from their corporate mobile phones, and no ones knows who else might follow suit. I spoke to the Guardianâs global technology editor, Dan Milmo, about why TikTok has climbed to the top of the security agenda. Thatâs right after the headlines. Five big stories Police | The leader of Britainâs police chiefs, Martin Hewitt, has said the Metropolitan Police has no âGod-given rightâ to exist in its current size if it cannot regain public trust that has rapidly deteriorated after a series of scandals. Hewitt, who is retiring after three decades in policing, has said it would take years for the force to regain the confidence of the public. Strikes | A cross-union group comprised of members from Britainâs biggest health unions are organising a campaign to reject the 5% pay increase being recommended by union leaders because it was well below inflation. Climate crisis | Fiame Naomi Mataâaf, the prime minister of Samoa, has issued a desperate plea for action ahead of a landmark IPCC report that is expected to issue a scientific âfinal warningâ on the climate emergency. âThere are already examples in the Pacific of communities, whole communities, that have relocated to different countries,â she said. âTheyâre really having to address issues of sovereignty through loss of land.â Russia-China ties | Vladimir Putin has praised Xi Jinping as a âgood old friendâ in an article published in China on the eve of a state visit to Moscow by the Chinese president, his first since the invasion of Ukraine. Emergency services | The government has launched a new public warning system where siren-like alerts will be sent to mobile phones about events that may put life in danger, such as severe flooding, wildfires or extreme weather. The Cabinet Office is planning a nationwide trial next month. In depth: âTikTok aggressively harvests your data â but thatâs pretty generic social media behaviourâ The US government has made its stance clear: Beijing-based ByteDance, TikTokâs owners, have to divest their stakes in the company or the video-sharing platform risks being banned from the country altogether. It is a dramatic escalation in the back and forth that has been happening between TikTok and the US government. But how much of this is really about TikTok? And what will happen next? *** What actually is the security risk? So far, thereâs no hard evidence to suggest that TikTok has been asked to hand over user data to the Chinese state or that it is manipulating its algorithm to push pro-Chinese propaganda. Dan points out that its practices so far seem to be no different to any other social media platform: âThe overarching debate about TikTok is that it aggressively harvests your data, your location, your likes etc. But thatâs pretty generic social media behaviour â on a basic level itâs no different to anyone else.â This is not to say that the fears are completely unfounded: ByteDance itself admitted that employees used their own app to spy on reporters in an attempt to track down the journalistsâ sources, severely damaging TikTokâs credibility. TikTok has also unveiled security plans in Europe and the US that will cost the company â¬1.2bn and $1.5bn respectively to convince western governments that it is protecting user data. All data of American users, for instance, would be stored within the US, or in Norway and Ireland for those accessing the app in Europe. Critics however are unconvinced that this is enough, saying that ultimately ByteDance has to comply with demands from the Chinese government. *** How likely is a sale? TikTokâs outsized cultural influence, paired with its highly engaged and growing user base means that it is a tremendous asset. However, Dan points out that selling still wouldnât necessarily be smooth sailing. âThere is an assumption among some experts in the field that the Chinese state will seek to block a divestment of TikTok from its Chinese owners because it owns precious IP [intellectual property] like its famed recommendation algorithm that makes its For You feed such a compelling experience,â Dan explains. Buying TikTok or a significant chunk of it would come with a lot of baggage and complex, unanswered questions about how exactly it could entirely unravel itself from ByteDance. Also, at a potential price of over $50bn for the US business alone, finding buyers that have pockets deep enough will be difficult. Companies like Snap would struggle to take that on, and there would be big antitrust concerns for any social media buyer. Microsoft and Oracle were potential suitors when Donald Trumpâs administration first tried to force through a sale of TikTok US in 2020, but that process was derailed amid successful legal challenges from TikTok. And with the Chinese government in the background too, a sale could be messy. *** Will there be a nationwide ban? Rishi Sunak has set out what the UK intends to do about TikTok: copy everyone else. In this case, the British government seems happy to follow the example of its allies. âQuite clearly what the government announced this week was related to what the United States, Canada, Belgium and the European Commission has done,â Dan says. The logical next step is that if the US is able to follow through with its threats that the UK would follow in its footsteps. But a nationwide ban is a very big leap from banning civil servants and politicians from using the app on government phones. Itâs become a staple part of many peopleâs social media diet and âan increasing number of peopleâs livelihoods depend on TikTok as creators, [so] moving to ban that entirely is quite a big step and I donât think weâre there yet,â Dan says. It is also important to note that the question of banning TikTok in the US is not legally settled. While there is bipartisan political consensus, TikTok has previously been able to ward off pressure from the White House. âThey successfully sued Donald Trumpâs attempts to ban the app in the US, so there already is a precedent of legal defence there, which would make it quite difficult for Biden.â *** TikTok becomes more open TikTokâs transition from cultural phenomenon to geopolitical pariah is a symbol of the hardening relationship between the US, the west more broadly, and China. The spy balloons saga, rising tensions over Taiwan and Chinaâs relationship with Russia has meant that TikTok is merely the latest site of contention about a much larger issue than a video-sharing app. But, TikTok has responded to its changing position, deciding it is time to come out of the shadows. âItâs suddenly become a much more public facing company. Its executives talk to journalists a lot more and itâs been making a lot more appearances in front of politicians on both sides of the Atlantic to try to state its case,â Dan says. Whether this is enough is yet to be seen. *** Whatâs next? Itâs unlikely that this hostility will stop at TikTok. Other Chinese tech firms and products are likely in the crosshairs of western politicians, says Dan. âSo the obvious question is whoâs next? Because either way it seems like this is about China, not TikTok.â What else weâve been reading It has been two decades since the UK and the US invaded Iraq, marking the start of a long, bloody war that was âbased on flawed intelligence, months of lying to the world, and a casual disregard for international lawâ, write Emma Graham-Harrison and Salim Habib.

","The BBC has urged its staff to delete the Chinese-own social media app TikTok from corporate mobile phones. Guidance to BBC staff circulated on Sunday said: âWe donât recommend installing TikTok on a BBC corporate device unless there is a justified business reason. If you do not need TikTok for business reasons, TikTok should be deleted.â The move comes after the UK government banned the app on government-issued phones amid fears of sensitive data being accessed by the Chinese government, owing to its ownership by the Chinese internet company ByteDance. Explaining the move, the BBC guidance said: âThe decision is based on concerns raised by government authorities worldwide regarding data privacy and security.â The BBC asked employees who have TikTok on their personal phones, but also use those devices for work reasons, to contact the organisationâs information security team in order to discuss âthe type of BBC information that you are working withâ. A BBC spokesperson said: âThe BBC takes the safety and security of our systems, data and people incredibly seriously. We constantly review activity on third-party platforms â including TikTok â and will continue to do so.â The corporation said the use of TikTok on BBC corporate devices â which have been bought and paid for by the organisation â was still permitted for editorial and marketing purposes. But the spokesperson said the BBC would continue to monitor and assess the situation. The move marks a sharp change in approach from the BBC, which has embraced TikTok as a way of reaching new audiences. Its TikTok channel has been running for more than a year and it has recruited a team of four TikTok specialists. Earlier this month Denmarkâs DR became the first national broadcaster to ban TikTok from staff work devices. It has gone further than the BBC by requiring staff to use only designated TikTok phones if they need the app for research purposes. On Friday the Cabinet Office said the governmentâs decision to ban TikTok from government phones was a âprudent and proportionate stepâ, after China criticised the move. The government said the ban did not extend to personal devices for government employees, ministers or the general public. The Cabinet Office said the ban was being imposed because TikTok users are required to hand over data including contacts, user content and geolocation data. Referring to similar government phone bans in the US, Canada, Belgium and the European Commission, the Cabinet Office said: âThe government, along with our international partners, is concerned about the way in which this data may be used.â TikTok says it does not share data with China, but the countryâs intelligence legislation requires companies to help the Communist party when requested. Critics fear this policy could expose data to Beijing, amid growing concerns about how China could use technology against the west. There are also concerns that the Chinese state could gain access to the TikTokâs recommendation algorithm, which curates what users see on the app, in order to manipulate what they view on the appâs main âFor Youâ feed. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Britain accused ministers of acting âbased on its political motive rather than factsâ. Last week TikTok described the UK ban as âbased on fundamental misconceptions and driven by wider geopoliticsâ. However, its denials of Chinese state interference have failed to convince the US government, which stepped up the pressure on TikTok significantly last week. TikTok said the Biden administration had asked TikTokâs Chinese owners to sell their stakes in the business, a move the company said would not address data concerns. TikTokâs chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, will be questioned by lawmakers in Washington DC on Thursday. Referring to the sale demand last week, he said: âSo far I havenât heard anything that cannot actually be solved by this.â TikTok has more than 1 billion users worldwide, including more than 100 million in the US. Previous attempts by the Trump administration to ban TikTok in the US, and to make the company sell stakes to US companies, foundered in the face of legal objections brought by the company. TikTok said: âWe are disappointed with the guidance that the BBC has shared but welcome the fact TikTok can still be used as part of editorial, marketing and reporting purposes. The BBC has a strong presence on our platform, with multiple accounts from news through to music reaching our engaged community both in the UK and around the world. âWe believe these bans have been based on fundamental misconceptions and driven by wider geopolitics. We remain in close dialogue with the BBC and are committed to working with them to address any concerns they have.â",Guardian,19/03/2023,BBC urges staff to delete TikTok from company mobile phones,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/19/bbc-urges-staff-to-delete-tiktok-from-company-mobile-phones

They criticize the paradoxical attitudes towards cleanliness, where people obsess over sanitized food but overlook littered streets. The author appreciates the aesthetic and sentimental value of aged wooden utensils and objects in the kitchen, highlighting the importance of haptic experiences and disregarding excessive germ concerns.","A few weeks ago, I finally plucked up the courage and went in â¦ to the shadowy place at the back of the fridge where no hand ever goes (sorry if you were expecting something more daring). To be clear, our fridge is quite clean, relatively speaking: nothing oozes in its salad crisper; no cheese rind awaits death in the place where the butter lives. But the top shelf, where I keep jars, open but not yet empty, was becoming too crowded. In the front row, I could see a Kilner of gherkins and some Daylesford blackcurrant and violet jam bought (ha) with a recent win on EuroMillions, and neither looked to me as if theyâd give us botulism. But the Lord alone knew what lurked behind. Something had to be done. Two hours later, and the dishwasher was full of jars, and the bin of their (mostly unrecognisable) contents: a satisfying morningâs work, and one that got me thinking about what else in the kitchen I might profitably clean. The spice cupboard, which looks a bit dusty? The space I laughably call my pantry, which has lately taken on a somewhat forlorn aspect? What I absolutely did not consider, however, was joining the crowd by boiling my wooden spoons. Iâm the child of a microbiologist. I hold to the notion that, broadly speaking, wood is naturally antibacterial. Iâve had the same chopping board for more than 15 years, and Iâve only ever wiped it with a damp, soapy cloth; no one has died so far. The creepy trend for boiling spoons â it is said to result in gruesome excretions â began on TikTok. A woman in the US called Lulaboo Jenkins posted a video of a ritual spoon-boiling that has been watched by 49 million people. I read about this, and even as I rolled my eyes â how utterly deranged, I thought â I recognised it as yet another sign of the strange state we are in. Our attitude to hygiene, and by extension to dirt in all its multifarious forms, is increasingly strange and stupid. Every city street is strewn with fast food wrappers; Iâve never known them to look more filthy. But while this seems to induce no disgust whatsoever in most people â they stroll on by, oblivious to the ketchup on their heels â much of the rest of life induces rank nausea. Still, we struggle to convince people to eat items that are past their sell-by date. Still, people cannot deal with food that has not been ruthlessly sanitised for them in advance. Fish must be decapitated, and meat wrapped in clingfilm; shoppers favour potatoes that carry no traces of soil, and apples that come in plastic bags. Something tells me that the spoon-boilers are the same people who are timid to the point of phobic when it comes to the distant prospect of mould; the carcass of a chicken; a foodstuff that has very briefly fallen on the floor; any kind of dish whose appearance is less than Insta perfect. Itâs all highly paradoxical. What they cannot see does not disturb them; most would balk if they knew what went on behind the scenes so far as the food chain goes. But equally, what is invisible is also borderline terrifying. These are the people who are forever spraying their work surfaces with chemicals, and who get extremely tense around shared utensils. But back to wooden spoons â and in fact, to all things wooden. I love an aged wooden spoon; in every way, they are more aesthetically pleasing than new (or boiled) ones. In junk shops, Iâm always on the hunt for ancient bread boards. They are so beautiful; I favour those with Bible verses carved around their edges. Life in the kitchen should involve pleasing haptic experiences, and there is nothing better than holding in your hand an object that is worn with use and love, but which is still useful. I may have mentioned before that I own an old bread knife with a wooden handle, on which are written the words âManners makyth manâ. The first âmâ is almost missing now, the victim of several generations of thumbs. This knife is no longer quite sharp enough for some modish crusts, but using it makes me feel happy and grounded: the kind of person (even more than usually) who couldnât care less about a few germs.",Guardian,18/03/2023,People are boiling their wooden spoons on TikTok.

35,"TikTok has faced bans from government-issued phones in the US, UK, and other countries due to concerns over data access and potential Chinese state espionage. The UK government cited data privacy issues and TikTok's ability to access user data from devices as reasons for the ban. While TikTok claims its data is stored outside China, critics worry about the Chinese state's potential manipulation of the app's recommendation algorithm. Experts argue that if there are cybersecurity concerns for government users, the same risks apply to all users.","TikTok is wildly popular, with more than 1 billion people consuming its short video posts around the world. But the app is less favoured by politicians in key markets such as the US and UK, where it has been banned from government-issued phones over security fears. We answer your questions about why TikTok has become a lightning rod for suspicion of Chinese state espionage â and whether nationwide bans are likely. Why has TikTok been banned from UK government phones? The main concerns with TikTok relate to data and the fact that it is owned by the Beijing-based ByteDance, a Chinese internet company. Could the Chinese state demand access to data generated by TikTokâs global user base and, for instance, create profiles of people it is interested in, such as government employees in other countries? The UK government raised data concerns in its statement explaining why it was taking the âprudentâ step of removing TikTok from government-issued devices. It said the app was able to access user data from devices, including contacts and geolocation. According to a report by the Australian-US cybersecurity firm Internet 2.0, TikTokâs app can access a userâs calendar, other running applications, wifi networks, and even the sim card serial number. Referring to similar bans by the US, Canada and the European Commission, the UK government said: âThe government, along with our international partners, is concerned about the way in which this data may be used.â TikTok maintains that its data is stored outside China in Singapore and the US. It is also proposing to store American and European user data in third-party servers in the US, Ireland and Norway. This has not been enough to assuage the concerns of critics, who also fear that the Chinese state could manipulate TikTokâs recommendation algorithm, which curates what people see on the appâs For You feed. Why is it not being banned from personal phones in the UK? The government said the âproportionate stepâ did not extend to personal devices for civil servants, ministers or the general public. However, it added that individuals should be aware of âeach social media platformâs data policiesâ before downloading them. TikTok has updated its privacy policy to tell European users that their data can be accessed in China â in specific circumstances. The decision to declare TikTok a risk on government devices but not on anyone elseâs has led to experts calling for more clarity. âThe bottom line is that if there is a cybersecurity issue for the government users, the same applies to all of us,â says Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University. âThe only argument might be that boring users such as me are not of interest, but there are plenty of professionals outside government where confidentiality is very important. Journalism, legal, medical and so on. If there is a security issue that nobody has found â and many have looked â then please tell us all so we can all delete it.â Why are there concerns about the Chinese state accessing TikTok data and its algorithm? TikTok is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, which has led to politicians in the US, the UK and elsewhere voicing fears that Chinese officials could demand access to TikTokâs user data and source code under domestic laws including the National Intelligence Law of 2017, which states that all organisations and citizens shall âsupport, assist and cooperateâ with national intelligence efforts. TikTok says it has not received a request from the Chinese government for its data and that, if it did, it would refuse. The US government does not believe TikTok, and this week confirmed that the Biden administration had asked TikTokâs Chinese owners to sell their stakes in the company or face a complete ban in a key market where it has more than 100 million users. TikTok says ByteDance is 60% owned by external investors including the US private equity firm KKR, 20% by its employees and 20% by its founders, Zhang Yiming and Liang Rubo, who carry stronger voting rights than the other shareholders. Can TikTok user data be accessed within China, including by the Chinese state? TikTok has long insisted that user data from western nations does not enter China, where ByteDance is based. But time and again, the company has admitted exceptions to this rule. In a privacy policy update from late 2022, the company admitted that European users may have their data accessed by employees in China, âbased on a demonstrated need to do their job, subject to a series of robust security controls and approval protocolsâ. In 2022, a BuzzFeed investigation revealed a rash of situations in which engineers in China would have access to US data, lasting at least until January 2022. The data was âstoredâ in the US, but with access controls that allowed staff elsewhere to access it, according to the investigation. The similar functionality of TikTok and its Chinese sister app Douyin suggests overlap between the engineering teams, but the extent to which resources are shared has remained fuzzy. Analysis of both apps suggests that they may share parts of their source code and are developed from a common code base, according to CitizenLab. TikTokâs credibility was also damaged last year when ByteDance admitted that employees had used the app to spy on reporters. Can the recommendation algorithm be manipulated by a state actor? The appâs much vaunted âFor Youâ page has a complex recommendation algorithm that takes into account a huge range of signals, both explicit and implicit, to decide what content a given user should be shown. Despite efforts to introduce transparency to how the company operates, the âFYPâ is, like many recommendation algorithms, a black box for users: the total count of signals, how they are applied, and how they result in any given piece of content appearing is ultimately impossible to see from the outside, and difficult even for TikTok itself to answer, given the nature of modern machine learning techniques. That means it is also difficult for the company to counter fears that the recommendation algorithm could be silently tampered with by a state actor, either through pressure at a corporate level, or through corrupting a small number of employees directly. In 2019, the Guardian revealed that TikTokâs moderation guidelines helped promote Beijingâs view of foreign policy, banning the promotion of separatist agendas in Tibet and Northern Ireland; the company says it now writes its moderation guidelines locally, but some fear that a similar approach would be harder to uncover if applied through automatic selective promotion and demotion of videos.",Guardian,17/03/2023,Why is TikTok banned from government phones â and should the rest of us be worried?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/17/why-is-tiktok-banned-from-government-phones-and-should-rest-of-us-be-worried
36,"Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles defended the Aukus pact, which has faced criticism from various political factions. The $368 billion deal involves Australia acquiring eight nuclear-powered submarines over the next 30 years. Marles dismissed concerns about potential obsolescence, emphasizing the ongoing need for submarine capabilities in the face of uncertain future threats. In other news, First Republic, a US bank, received a $45 billion rescue package, global fresh water demand is projected to outstrip supply by 40% by 2030, and New Zealand has banned TikTok on government devices.


","Happy Friday! The defence minister, Richard Marles, was central to the Aukus pact that will see Australia spend $368bn for eight nuclear-powered submarines over the next three decades. In conversation with our Australian Politics podcast, Marles defended the deal, which has come under sustained criticism from all sides of politics, including Paul Keating, Malcolm Turnbull, the Greens and members of the crossbench. Asked whether the submarines could be obsolete by the time they hit the waters in the 2040s, given rapid technological advancements, Marles said to âflip the questionâ. âHow confident are we that the veil of the sea will be lifted by 2050 such that we donât need a submarine capability? Well, that would be a negligently risky call to make on the part of any Australian government.â You can listen to the episode from 7am tomorrow, or read a sneak preview here. Top news Another US bank in trouble | First Republic is the latest US bank to hit tough times, with Wall Street giants stepping in to provide the mid-sized bank a $45bn rescue package. Cash-short banks have borrowed a staggering $447bn from the US central bank in the past week to prevent a crisis spreading through the global financial system.

Australia buys US cruise missiles | To accompany the Virginia class submarines being bought from the US, Australia is spending $1.3bn to buy 220 Tomahawk cruise missiles. The Pentagon says the sale will âenhance the capability of US Forces operating alongside them globallyâ. Productivity Commission report drops | And among its 71 recommendations is a contentious idea to allow the Fair Work Commission to revise minimum wages in awards to âexpand flexibility for many small businessesâ, potentially cutting pay for some. Chalmers says the government âwonât be taking up every ideaâ, adding that a review of the Productivity Commission is under way. Global water emergency | Global fresh water demand will outstrip supply by 40% by 2030, say experts. The landmark report listed seven recommendations for governments to address the looming crisis. Separately, Australians consume bottled water more than almost everyone else in the world â bar Singapore. We spend, on average, $580 buying 504L of bottled water, despite most of us having drinkable water available to us from our kitchen tap.

37,"The rise of patient influencers on platforms like TikTok and Instagram has raised concerns about the ethical and legal boundaries of sharing prescription drug advice without disclosing relationships with drug companies. Patient influencers, who lack medical training, offer personal experiences and advice to their followers. The patient influencer industry is largely unregulated, taking advantage of permissive laws on prescription drug marketing in countries like the US. Research on the industry is limited, and there is a lack of transparency regarding influencer relationships with pharmaceutical companies and adherence to regulations.","A young TikTok user has long, wavy hair, glowing makeup and a radiant smile. Sheâs slim and wants you to know exactly why: sheâs using Wegovy, a prescription drug originally developed to treat diabetes thatâs become a popular drug for weight loss. In one clip, she picks up the medication from a pharmacy, lip-syncing to Cardi B, then demonstrates in a following clip how she injects it into her leg. A caption flashes across the screen: âIâm not a doctor just FYI.â Moments later she advises her nearly 20,000 followers on how to get started on the drug. âStart on the 0.25 mg,â she says directly into camera. âWork your way up with each dose. Do not skip doses. I do not want any of you feeling sick.â Sheâs whatâs called a patient influencer. They have no medical training and claim that theyâre simply sharing their personal experiences with their TikTok and Instagram followers. But in this quickly growing and largely unregulated arena, itâs gotten harder to tell when influencing crosses legal and ethical lines. Many patient influencers offer prescription drug advice to their followers without always revealing their relationships with drug companies, according to Erin Willis, a University of Colorado, Boulder, associate professor who authored a study about patient influencers released this week. Since patient influencers often share highly personal, vulnerable stories about their own health conditions, audiences find them trustworthy: a 2020 survey by a Wego, a major patient influencer agency, found that 51% of respondents said they mostly or completely trusted patient influencers, compared with just 14% who said the same for lifestyle influencers. An accompanying blogpost explains: âThese patient leaders have built a well-established foundation of authenticity and trust in their communities.â In exchange for hawking a health product or service, a patient influencer can expect to earn anywhere from âthe low hundreds to a few thousand dollarsâ per social media post, depending on the health condition and the size of their online following, according to Amrita Bhowmick, the chief community officer at Health Union, a marketing firm that bought Wego in 2021. Patient influencers can do this thanks to some of the worldâs most permissive laws on prescription drug marketing. The US is one of two countries (the other is New Zealand) that allow direct-to-consumer (DTC) ads for prescription drugs. Since 1997, the Food and Drug Administration has allowed drug companies to push prescription medications on American airwaves as long as the ads are truthful, explain what the drug has been approved to treat, mention its major risks, and contain a disclaimer like âtalk to your doctorâ. Studies find DTC ads lead to doctors prescribing them more â driving the market for these ads to nearly $7bn last year, industry statistics show. There are no published figures on the size of the patient influencer industry â but all indications are that itâs booming, says Willis. Medical ad agencies are typically tight-lipped about using patient influencers, but âtheyâre all engaged in this practice â¦ this is a strategy that the pharmaceutical companies have found that works,â she says. Last summer, Willis spoke at a pharmaceutical marketing conference and asked the audience to raise their hands if they used patient influencers â nearly the whole room did. Part of what makes patient influencers effective is that they often push messaging further than what would be allowed on media like TV, where ads are far more closely scrutinized by regulators like the FDA and Federal Trade Commission. Willis calls patient influencing âan interactive form of advertisingâ thatâs âdifficult to regulate, if itâs been regulated at allâ. (In an emailed statement, an FDA spokesperson said the agency âtakes its responsibilities seriously and will continue to monitor promotions and communications regarding prescription drugs through its surveillance operations, which include online platformsâ.) Willis found that all 26 patient influencers she spoke to in her study viewed themselves as âexpertsâ and framed their efforts as raising awareness by sharing their own experiences. But some said they had discussed medications beyond those that they had taken, and many said they had discussed medications with followers over private messages. Itâs those less visible kinds of content â including short-form and disappearing video â that are particularly concerning to Willis: âWe donât actually really know what all patients are doing, or what content theyâre posting, or if theyâre disclosing their relationship with pharmaceutical companies.â In an email to the Guardian, Health Unionâs Bhowmick says the company recruits and approves its influencers, whom it calls âpatient leadersâ, based on their âexisting online presenceâ, or their participation on message boards that Health Union has set up for specific medical conditions, such as Migraine.com. Bhowmick, who helped Willis analyze her findings, says the company shares Willisâs concerns and âworks with all our patient leaders to ensure they follow our best practices and community rules in all online activities â such as not providing medical advice and adhering to FTC guidelines for sponsored activitiesâ. Right now, we can only take their word for it. While federal law requires pharmaceutical companies to disclose the amount of money they pay doctors, no such rule exists for patients. And if an influencer doesnât reveal that theyâre on a drug companyâs payroll, thereâs no way to tell if itâs an advertisement that should be subject to regulation. On a recent TikTok post by the young Wegovy influencer, one of her followers commented: âIâve been on it for 3 weeks and havenât lost a single pound. Pls tell me it will start to work.â The influencer responded: âBump up the dose.â Another commenter complains: âMade me soooo sick. Projectile vomiting because I didnât poop for 10-15 days at a time.â The TikToker replies: âStoppp!!! Omg!! Did you do the .25 dose??â With no listed sponsorships on her profile, itâs not clear whether sheâs broken any advertising rules. And with the countless patient influencers out there â Health Union alone boasts a network of âover 100,000 patient leadersâ â itâs hard to say how many social media users are dispensing unvetted medical advice, or making money while doing so. A big problem, Willis says, is there remains an âalarming lack of researchâ on the industry â and that research is difficult because âno oneâs willing to talk about itâ. âWhen you ask advertising professionals, theyâre not going to tell you much because of NDAs that they sign,â she says. And in her most recent study, ânone of the influencers I spoke to were going to get into the weeds of the relationship [with companies] or the contracts with me. My thought is, if nothing is wrong about the practice, then why isnât more known about it?â This article was amended on 17 March 2023. An earlier version incorrectly attributed the assertion that influencers may not reveal their ties to drug companies to the study rather than to Willisâs own observations.",Guardian,17/03/2023,âIâm not a doctor just FYIâ: the influencers paid to hawk drugs on TikTok,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/17/patient-influencers-tiktok-instagram-medical-prescription-drugs
38,"TikTok is facing concerns about data security and potential ties to the Chinese government. The FBI and FCC warn of data sharing risks, but there is no evidence of it happening. The US government is reviewing the situation and may impose restrictions or ban the app. Other countries have already banned TikTok on government devices. TikTok claims to address security concerns and plans to delete US user data from its servers. There are differing opinions on the legitimacy of security risks. Banning tech companies has precedent but may face legal challenges.","TikTok is once again fending off claims that its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, would share user data from its popular video-sharing app with the Chinese government, or push propaganda and misinformation on its behalf. Chinaâs foreign ministry on Wednesday accused the US itself of spreading disinformation about TikTokâs potential security risks following a report in the Wall Street Journal that the committee on foreign investment in the US â part of the treasury department â was threatening a US ban on the app unless its Chinese owners divest their stake. So are the data security risks real? And should users be worried that the TikTok app will be wiped off their phones? Hereâs what to know: What are the concerns about TikTok? Both the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share TikTok user data â such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers â with Chinaâs authoritarian government. A law implemented by China in 2017 requires companies to give the government any personal data relevant to the countryâs national security. Thereâs no evidence that TikTok has turned over such data, but fears abound due to the vast amount of user data it, like other social media companies, collects. Concerns around TikTok were heightened in December when ByteDance said it fired four employees who accessed data on two journalists from BuzzFeed News and the Financial Times while attempting to track down the source of a leaked report about the company. Just last week, the director of the FBI, Christopher Wray, told the Senate intelligence committee that TikTok âscreamsâ of national security concerns and that China could also manipulate the algorithm to spread misinformation. âThis is a tool that is ultimately within the control of the Chinese government, and to me, it screams out with national security concerns,â Wray said. How is the US responding? The White House national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, declined to comment when asked on Thursday to address the Chinese foreign ministryâs comments about TikTok, citing the review being conducted by the committee on foreign investment. Kirby also could not confirm that the administration sent TikTok a letter warning that the US government may ban the application if its Chinese owners donât sell its stake but added, âwe have legitimate national security concerns with respect to data integrity that we need to observe.â In 2020, then president Donald Trump and his administration sought to force ByteDance to sell off its US assets and ban TikTok from app stores. Courts blocked the effort, and President Joe Biden rescinded Trumpâs orders but directed an in-depth study of the issue. A planned sale of TikTokâs US assets was also shelved as the Biden administration negotiated a deal with the app that would address some of the national security concerns. In Congress, US senators Richard Blumenthal and Jerry Moran, a Democrat and a Republican, respectively, wrote a letter in February to the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, urging the committee on foreign investment panel, which she chairs, to âswiftly conclude its investigation and impose strict structural restrictionsâ between TikTokâs US operations and ByteDance, including potentially separating the companies. At the same time, lawmakers have introduced measures that would expand the Biden administrationâs authority to enact a national ban on TikTok. The White House has already backed a Senate proposal that has bipartisan support. How has TikTok already been restricted? On Thursday, British authorities said they were banning TikTok on government-issued phones on security grounds, after similar moves by the EUâs executive branch, which temporarily banned TikTok from employee phones. Denmark and Canada have also announced efforts to block the app on government-issued phones. Last month, the White House said it would give US federal agencies 30 days to delete TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. Congress, the US armed forces and more than half of US states had already banned the app on official devices. What does TikTok say? A TikTok spokesperson, Maureen Shanahan, said the company was already answering security concerns through âtransparent, US-based protection of US user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verificationâ. In June, TikTok said it would route all data from US users to servers controlled by Oracle, the Silicon Valley company it chose as its US tech partner in 2020 in an effort to avoid a nationwide ban. But it is storing backups of the data in its own servers in the US and Singapore. The company said it expects to delete US user data from its own servers, but it has not provided a timeline as to when that would occur. The TikTok CEO, Shou Zi Chew, is will testify next week before the House energy and commerce committee about the companyâs privacy and data-security practices, as well as its relationship with the Chinese government. In the lead-up to the hearing, Chew has quietly met with several lawmakers â some of whom remain unmoved by their conversation with the 40-year-old executive. After convening with Chew in February, Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado who previously called on Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores, said he remained âfundamentally concerned that TikTok, as a Chinese-owned company, is subject to dictates from the Chinese Communist partyâ. Meanwhile, TikTokâs parent company, ByteDance, has been trying to position itself as more of an international company â and less of a Chinese company that was founded in Beijing in 2012 by its current chief executive, Liang Rubo, and others. Theo Bertram, TikTokâs vice-president of policy in Europe, said in a tweet on Thursday that ByteDance âis not a Chinese companyâ. Bertram said its ownership consists of 60% global investors, 20% employees and 20% founders. Its leaders are based in cities such as Singapore, New York, Beijing and other metropolitan areas. Are the security risks legitimate? It depends on whom you ask. Some tech privacy advocates say that while the potential abuse of privacy by the Chinese government is concerning, other tech companies have data-harvesting business practices that also exploit user information. âIf policymakers want to protect Americans from surveillance, they should advocate for a basic privacy law that bans all companies from collecting so much sensitive data about us in the first place, rather than engaging in what amounts to xenophobic showboating that does exactly nothing to protect anyone,â said Evan Greer, director of the non-profit advocacy group Fight for the Future. Karim Farhat, a researcher with the Internet Governance Project at Georgia Tech, said a TikTok sale would be âcompletely irrelevant to any of the alleged ânational securityâ threatsâ and go against âevery free market principle and normâ of the state departmentâs internet freedom principles. Others say there is legitimate reason for concern. People who use TikTok might think theyâre not doing anything that would be of interest to a foreign government, but thatâs not always the case, said Anton Dahbura, executive director of the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute. Important information about the US is not strictly limited to nuclear power plants or military facilities; it extends to other sectors, such as food processing, the finance industry and universities, Dahbura said. Is there precedent for banning tech companies? Last year, the US banned the sale of communications equipment made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE, citing risks to national security. But banning the sale of items could be more easily done than banning an app, which is accessed through the web. Such a move might also go to the courts on grounds that it could violate the first amendment as some civil liberties groups have argued.",Guardian,17/03/2023,The TikTok wars â why the US and China are feuding over the app,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/16/the-tiktok-wars-why-the-us-and-china-are-feuding-over-the-app

New Zealand's parliament has decided to ban TikTok from all parliamentary devices due to security concerns. The decision follows similar bans by major Western allies like the UK, US, Canada, and the European Commission. Concerns revolve around data access and manipulation by the Chinese government, although TikTok denies these allegations. While the ban doesn't extend to MPs' personal phones, the app must be uninstalled to access parliamentary applications. Some MPs, including Te P_ti M_ori leaders and Act party leader, use TikTok for political content.","New Zealandâs parliament will ban TikTok from all parliamentary devices, amid mounting international security concerns surrounding the app. The countryâs MPs were informed by parliamentary service on Friday that the Chinese-owned video-sharing app would be blocked from all parliamentary devices at the end of the month, and were told via email that âthe Service has determined that the risks are not acceptable in the current New Zealand parliament environmentâ. âThe decision to block the TikTok application has been made based on our own analysis and following discussion with our colleagues across government and internationally,â the email reads. New Zealandâs decision follows similar rulings by some of its major western allies. Earlier in the week, the UK government announced that TikTok would be banned, effective immediately, from ministersâ and civil servantsâ mobile phones. The US, Canada, and the European Commission already had a ban in place. TikTok is owned by Beijing-based company ByteDance, and concerns surrounding its security have centred on whether the Chinese state could access data recorded by the appâs billion users, or manipulate the algorithm to push pro-China content. TikTok has denied its data or algorithms can be accessed or manipulated by the Chinese government, saying it has not been asked for data, and would refuse any future requests. In recent months, however, as relationships with Beijing have been strained by the shooting down of Chinese surveillance balloons, a number of western countries have introduced bans on the app on parliamentary devices â with the US going a step further, to consider an outright ban on the app. In early March, the White House said it supported legislation that would allow the administration to ban TikTok and other foreign-based technologies completely if they pose national security threats. The New Zealand ban does not specifically cover MPsâ personal phones, but those phones must have the app uninstalled in order to access any parliament applications. A number of New Zealand MPs use TikTok to post political videos and commentary. Among the most prolific are Te PÄti MÄori leaders Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi, and Act party leader David Seymour. The MÄori party had not responded to requests for comment by time of publication. A spokesperson for Act said the partyâs TikTok account âis run from a personal phone free of parliamentary information. We have been taking this precaution for some time.â",Guardian,17/03/2023,New Zealand to ban TikTok from government devices,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/17/new-zealand-to-ban-tiktok-from-government-devices
40,"A cross-party group of UK MPs and peers, part of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), has requested an investigation by the information commissioner into TikTok's potential breach of UK data protection laws. This comes shortly after the UK government banned TikTok from government-owned phones. IPAC believes TikTok may need to shut down operations in the UK if it fails to comply. TikTok denies the allegations and is working on a European data security plan. Concerns revolve around data access and the Chinese ownership of the app.","A cross-party group of MPs and peers have asked the information commissioner to investigate whether the Chinese-owned TikTokâs handling of personal information is in breach of UK law. The letter from the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) argues that TikTok cannot be compliant with data protection rules â and comes just hours after the UK announced a ban on the popular video-sharing app appearing on ministersâ and officialsâ government-owned phones. IPAC believes TikTok could ultimately be forced to shut operations in the UK if it cannot find a way of complying, amid escalating western pressure on the company because of its Chinese ownership and the security of the data of its millions of users. But TikTok said it is a victim of âfundamental misconceptionsâ which it earlier complained were âdriven by wider geopoliticsâ in which ordinary people play no part â and that it had begun work on a European data security plan to head off the legal concern. Earlier on Thursday, Oliver Dowden, the Cabinet Office minister, said that following a security review by UK intelligence officials, the app would be banned from the government phones of ministers, advisers and civil servants âwith immediate effectâ. Dowden said TikTok required users to give permission for the app to access data stored on the device, which is then collected and stored by the company â and can be accessed from China. Allowing such permissions gives TikTok access to a range of data, including contacts, user content and geolocation data. Dowden said this justified the ban because there was âa specific risk with government devicesâ. Britain joined the US, the European Commission, Canada and Belgium in banning TikTok on government devices in recent weeks amid a further deterioration of relations with China. A UK foreign policy review earlier this week described Beijing as posing an âepoch-defining challengeâ to the west. But China accused the UK of abusing the concept of national security. âThe decision was made by the UK side based on its political motive rather than facts,â an embassy spokesperson said, adding that it âundermines the confidence of the international community in the UKâs business environmentâ and would hurt British interests. Dowdenâs announcement marks a sharp U-turn from the UKâs previous position and also came a few hours after TikTok said its owner, ByteDance, had been told by Washington to sell the app or face a possible ban in the country. The fresh complaint from the MPs and peers was made by a group including Labour, Conservative and Lib Dems, and is intended to ask the Chinese-owned company wider questions potentially affecting all of its users. One of the MPs, Carolyn Harris, representing Labour, also said she was âdeleting her TikTok account todayâ and âencouraging others to do the sameâ. Harris, whose videos regularly notch up tens of thousands of views, said she had believed TikTok was a good way of communicating about her chosen campaign issues, including menopause awareness. But the MP added: âI donât want my constituents being exposed to the Chinese Communist partyâs data harvesting. So I believe MPs have a responsibility to set an exampleâ. At the heart of the complaint is TikTokâs acknowledgment that user data can in some circumstances be accessed from China, and so outside UK safeguards. âIt is my understanding that TikTok cannot implement appropriate safeguards to protect personal data that is transferred outside of the UK and EEA region,â wrote Lord Bethell, a Conservative peer, who is another complainant. Other members of the IPAC seeking answers from the information commissioner include the Conservatives Iain Duncan Smith and Tim Loughton, the Lib Dems Wera Hobhouse and Alistair Carmichael, and Labourâs Sarah Champion. Particular concern centres on a 2017 national security law in China, which requires organisations and citizens to âsupport, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence workâ. It has been cited in the past to justify complete bans on kit made by Huawei, also a Chinese company, in UK and other 5G telecoms networks. Caroline Carruthers, a data consultant, said the concerns of MPs and peers should be examined by the Information Commissionerâs Office because any company that sends its data to China cannot guarantee that the way it is processed will adhere to UK laws. TikTok has told European users â and MPs in evidence given to parliament â that their data can be accessed by staff in China for limited reasons such as checking the performance of its algorithms. âLord Bethell has a good point that this is a grey area in law, where we have a potential for the cross-country data transfer laws in the UK to be contradicted by the National Intelligence Law in China, for instance.â A spokesperson for the ICO said the letter raised âserious concernsâ that it would review. âProtecting peopleâs rights is an important part of our work, and we work closely with organisations, including scrutinising the privacy practices of the big tech platforms. This letter raises serious concerns, and we will be reviewing it in detail,â they added. TikTok said it had begun work on âa comprehensive planâ to protect European user data, including storing UK user data in its European datacentres and including third-party independent oversight of its approach. A TikTok spokesperson added that the claims in the letter were âbased on fundamental misconceptionsâ. They said âTikTokâs user data is stored in the US and Singapore, not Chinaâ and that the company was incorporated outside of China. âWe comply with strict data laws, such as GDPR, in the UK and EU, which also govern data transfers,â they added. Earlier in the day, responding to the UK government ban, TikTok also blamed âwider geopolitics, in which TikTok, and our millions of users in the UK, play no partâ.",Guardian,16/03/2023,MPs and peers ask information commissioner to investigate TikTok,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/16/mps-and-peers-ask-information-commissioner-to-investigate-tiktok
41,"The UK's change in stance on TikTok ban follows actions by its allies, including the US, Canada, and the EU, amid concerns about data security and Chinese ownership. While there is no concrete evidence supporting these concerns, geopolitical tensions and the perception of a security threat have damaged TikTok's reputation. The UK's ban may be influenced by geopolitical factors rather than concrete proof, raising the possibility of a complete ban or forced divestment from Chinese ownership. Similar fears surround other Chinese tech companies.","When asked this week whether the UK would ban TikTok on government phones, Rishi Sunakâs response signalled a change in stance: âWe look at what our allies are doing.â Previously ministers had seemed sanguine, even saying that whether or not the app stayed on someoneâs phone should be a matter of âpersonal choiceâ. Not any more. The UKâs allies are turning against TikTok and it was when Sunak said he was watching their actions closely that a government ban became inevitable. The US, Canada and the EUâs executive arm have already decided to strip the app from official devices. It is now a matter of geopolitical choice. TikTok is owned by the Beijing-based ByteDance. The fear among its critics on both sides of the Atlantic is that the Chinese state can access data generated by its more than 1 billion users and manipulate its recommendation algorithm in order to push a China-friendly point of view to unsuspecting users. There is no hard evidence this is the case and TikTok says it would refuse any data request from the Chinese government, although the UK government cited concerns about âthe way in which this [user] data may be usedâ for the ban on Thursday. But tensions over Taiwan, concerns that China will supply weaponry to Russia, the shooting down of a spy balloon that hovered over the US and warnings of state espionage have created a toxic backdrop to those denials. And on Monday a refreshed integrated review of UK defence and foreign policy described China as an âepoch-definingâ challenge. TikTokâs reputation was severely damaged last year when ByteDance admitted employees had attempted to use the app to spy on reporters. TikTok will be concerned that Sunak will match each upward ratchet in pressure from his counterparts. On Wednesday the Biden administration demanded the platformâs Chinese owner sell the app or face a complete ban. Will the UK ultimately threaten the same? If geopolitics is the leading factor in these moves, as opposed to hard proof that TikTok poses a security threat, then it is likely every deterioration in relations between China and the west will push the app further along the road to a complete ban or forced divestment from its owners in the UK and elsewhere. Indeed, a forced sale in the US â if the Chinese government lets TikTokâs owners do so â could lead to TikTok being peeled off from ByteDance in its entirety. The shooting down of a Chinese spy balloon off the east coast of the US last month was followed by reports that negotiations between TikTok and the Biden administration over a deal to resolve security concerns had stalled, while this week the White House gave its support to a Senate bill giving the president the power to ban TikTok. TikTokâs attempts to assuage those concerns â for instance announcing plans to store US and European user data on third-party data servers â seem to have failed with the current American president in the same way they did with his immediate predecessor, who also tried to force a divestment of TikTokâs US business. The backstop used by TikTokâs critics is the existence of Chinese laws that could force ByteDance to cooperate with Beijing authorities, including the national intelligence law of 2017, which states that all organisations and citizens shall âsupport, assist and cooperateâ with national intelligence efforts. For many, this is enough evidence. Perhaps eliminating the concerns over Chinese interference by selling TikTok to non-Chinese investors is the only way to quell the critics. But there are plenty of other aspects of the Chinese tech industry â from Huawei mobile phones to other electronic devices â that are just as capable of eliciting similar fears. Without strong supporting evidence there is no way of knowing how proportionate the UK government is being â and the same could be true for moves against other Chinese tech interests.",Guardian,16/03/2023,Will UK follow US in demanding TikTok be sold by its Chinese owner?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/16/will-uk-follow-us-in-demanding-tiktok-be-sold-by-its-chinese-owner
42,"The Biden administration has threatened to ban TikTok in the US unless its Chinese owners divest their stakes, citing concerns about data security and potential Chinese government access. This marks the first time such a ban has been threatened under Biden's administration. TikTok, with over 100 million US users, has faced backlash globally, with countries like the UK, Canada, and Australia banning the app from government phones. TikTok denies spying allegations and emphasizes its data security efforts. China accused the US of spreading disinformation and suppressing TikTok.","The Biden administration has threatened to ban TikTok in the US unless the social media companyâs Chinese owners divest their stakes in it, according to news reports on Wednesday. The move, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, is the most dramatic in a series of escalations by US officials and legislators, driven by fears that US user data held by the company could be passed on to Chinaâs government. It also comes amid a global backlash to the popular video-based app over concerns about the potential for Chinese spying, with countries including the UK, Canada and Australia recently moving to ban the app from government phones. The US has already banned TikTok on federal government devices but this marks the first time under Bidenâs administration that a potential nationwide ban on TikTok has been threatened. Any US ban would face significant legal hurdles. Bidenâs predecessor, Donald Trump, had tried to ban TikTok in 2020 but was blocked by the courts. A TikTok spokesperson, Brooke Oberwetter, told Reuters that the company had recently heard from the US Treasury-led committee on foreign investment in the United States (CFIUS), which demanded that the Chinese owners of the app sell their shares, and said otherwise they would face a possible US ban of the video app. TikTok is one of the worldâs most popular social networks with more than 100 million US users. The Journal said 60% of shares in ByteDance, which owns TikTok, are owned by global investors, 20% by employees and 20% by its founders. CFIUS, a powerful national security body, in 2020 had unanimously recommended that ByteDance divest TikTok. âIf protecting national security is the objective, divestment doesnât solve the problem: a change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access,â TikTokâs Oberwetter said in a statement. The move comes as TikTokâs CEO, Shou Zi Chew, is due to appear before the US Congress next week. TikTok and CFIUS have been negotiating for more than two years on data security requirements. TikTok said it has spent more than $1.5bn on rigorous data security efforts and rejects spying allegations. TikTok said on Wednesday that âthe best way to address concerns about national security is with the transparent, US-based protection of US user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verificationâ. China accused the U S of spreading disinformation and suppressing TikTok. The US has yet to present evidence that TikTok threatens its national security and was using the excuse of data security to abuse its power to suppress foreign companies, the foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, told reporters at a daily briefing. âThe US should stop spreading disinformation about data security, stop suppressing the relevant company, and provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for foreign businesses to invest and operate in the US,â Wang said. The news of a potential US ban followed reports this week that Britain is moving forward with its own plan to ban TikTok on government cellphones. The European Commission announced a similar ban last month, and on Monday, Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, hinted that he may follow suit, saying he would take âwhatever steps are necessaryâ to protect Britainâs security. The cabinet officeâs announcement of a potential ban could come as early as Thursday, sources told the Guardian, which reported that some critics and experts were calling for Britain to extend the ban to also cover personal phones of officials and ministers. Talk of restrictions across the globe have escalated in recent weeks after news of the Chinese spy balloon that was found hovering over the US. The scandal prompted a US congressional committee to move forward with legislation that would empower the US president to ban the app. Michael McCaul, a GOP congressman and chair of that committee, said he feared TikTok was akin to âspy balloon in your phoneâ. Amid the increasing scrutiny, TikTok earlier this month announced a data security plan that said would protect user information across Europe. That plan, called Project Clover, involves data storage on servers in Ireland and Norway, with a third-party IT company vetting any transfers of data outside of Europe.

The decision brings the UK in line with the US government and the European Commission, both of which announced similar bans on TikTok in the past month, and it demonstrates how fast western trust in China and TikTok has deteriorated in recent months. But it marks a sharp reverse from the UKâs previously relaxed position. Just over a fortnight ago Donelan said the UK would not follow other governments and that the decision to install the app should be for an individual politician or minister to make. âAs a Conservative, I strongly believe in personal choice,â she said. A TikTok spokesperson said the company was disappointed. âWe believe these bans have been based on fundamental misconceptions and driven by wider geopolitics, in which TikTok, and our millions of users in the UK, play no part. We remain committed to working with the government to address any concerns.â The company said it had begun work on âa comprehensive planâ to protect European user data, including storing UK user data in its European datacentres and including third-party independent oversight of its approach. TikTok has acknowledged that UK personal data goes abroad, including to China, for its global staff to undertake certain âimportant functionsâ. Labourâs Angela Rayner accused the government of being âbehind the curve with sticking plaster solutionsâ given the previously announced bans abroad â and asked why the âspecific riskâ only applied to central government phones and tablets. The partyâs deputy leader also asked whether there had been âa root and branch reviewâ of the use of mobile phones by ministers, referring to the feared hacking of Liz Trussâs phone when she was foreign secretary and Matt Hancockâs WhatsApp messages, which ended up in the hands of the Daily Telegraph. âCan he say if there were any discussions during this process about the use of private messaging such as WhatsApp and email by ministers?â Rayner asked MPs. Dowden replied saying that ministers received âextensive advice when they take officeâ and that the government was updating its guidance on private messaging by ministers. Iain Duncan Smith, a Conservative MP who has repeatedly raised security concerns about China, said ministers and officialsâ personal phones also should be covered by a ban because âprivate phones will remain on their desksâ. He added: âThe point Iâd make is you canât stop there.â But in answer, Dowden said there was âa balance the government has to try to get rightâ.

Top news Global banking fears | The Swiss central bank will loan embattled giant Credit Suisse $81.5bn a day after its share price plummeted to a record low. That wasnât enough, however, to assuage fears of a broader crisis in the global banking sector. Asian stocks slid, as did shares in Australiaâs big banks, which were down about 2% in early trading today. New Zealand recession? | The economy shrank 0.6% in the December quarter â larger than predicted by any of New Zealandâs major banks. Annually, GDP is still growing, up 2.4% year on year. If the downturn continues this quarter, it would mean New Zealand is about six months into a recession. To be considered âin recessionâ, the economy has to record negative GDP growth for two consecutive quarters. Unemployment rate falls | Australiaâs economy added almost 65,000 jobs in February, more than economists expected, indicating hiring was holding up amid the record run of interest rate rises. The jobless rate fell to 3.5%, compared with Januaryâs reported 3.7%. Bruce Lehrmann âmillionsâ text | Lehrmann (pictured) allegedly sent a text to his then girlfriend on 15 February 2021 that he could obtain millions in a defamation claim if he was named in the media, a court has heard. âIf Iâm named tonight, he says Iâm up for millions as defamation,â the text read. Lehrmann, who was giving evidence in person today, explained that he was trying to placate his girlfriend. Lehrmann is seeking to sue Network Ten and News Corp over their reporting of Brittany Higginsâs allegations of rape two years ago, allegations which he has consistently and vehemently denied. Latitude cyber-attack | Consumer lender Latitude Financial has been hit by a âsophisticated and malicious cyber-attackâ that has resulted in the theft of more than 100,000 identification documents and 225,000 customer records. The non-bank lender, which offers personal loans and credit to customers shopping at such stores as JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman, said in a statement that most of the identification documents were copies of driverâs licences. US threatens to ban TikTok | The Biden administration is reportedly threatening to ban the popular social platform unless its Chinese owners divest their stakes. Itâs the latest and most dramatic move in a series of escalations driven by fears that US user data held by the company could be passed on to Chinaâs government. Israel civil war warning | Israelâs president, Isaac Herzog, says civil war âis within touching distanceâ. His comments come amid continued mass protests against the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahuâs attempts to weaken the judiciary. Netanyahu has previously said overhauling the judiciary has nothing to do with his corruption trial.

Jeremy Fleming, the GCHQ boss, said last October said he would encourage young people to use TikTok, but said he would encourage them to âthink aboutâ how their personal data is used. Concerns appears to be centred on long-standing concerns about a 2017 national security law in China, which requires organisations and citizens to âsupport, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence workâ.

TikTok Australia's general manager emphasized that the company is not Chinese and stores Australian user data in Singapore and the US.","The New South Wales government is considering banning public sector employees from using TikTok on work devices, engaging federal cybersecurity agencies for advice amid concerns over the social video appâs links to China. As the federal government considers the security of the app, the NSW electoral commission has confirmed software â including TikTok â is not permitted to be downloaded on to work mobile phones without prior approval. The state government does not yet have an overarching policy for the appâs download and use on department devices, but Guardian Australia understands that is now being reviewed. Currently NSW departments and agencies are allowed to decide their own course of action. Nearly half of all federal agencies have reportedly banned the app on government-owned devices in recent months, which has been criticised by the federal opposition for lacking a consistent and overarching response to the use of the app. The home affairs department will this month finalise a review for minister Clare OâNeil into the security risks of all social media platforms and the correct government settings. While privacy and security of data is a concern for all social media apps, the concern with TikTok and fellow China-based app WeChat has been for how data could be accessed under Chinaâs national security law. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, this week indicated Britain could follow the US and Canada in banning the app from government devices, saying he would take âwhatever steps are necessaryâ to protect security. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The NSW government has commenced talks with the Australian Signals Directorateâs Australian Cyber Security Centre about the app, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance. âThe NSW Government is aware of this issue and is currently working with the ACSC,â a government spokesperson said. âThe NSW government does not have an overarching policy prohibiting TikTok from government devices. Each agency has social media guidelines and procedures in place to govern how social media apps are used on work-issued devices.â The stateâs own agency â Cyber Security NSW â has advised all users to take security and privacy âinto considerationâ when downloading any app on to a corporate device. âCyber Security NSW continually reviews guidance and develops products for NSW government entities on workplace systems and apps,â the spokesperson said. âCyber Security NSW will maintain a vigilant approach to cyber security.â The NSW electoral commission would not provide âdetailed public commentaryâ on its cybersecurity plans but confirmed employees were banned from downloading the app without explicit approval. The agency is working with Cyber Security NSW, the commonwealthâs electoral integrity assurance taskforce and the ACSC. NSW Laborâs digital spokesperson, Yasmin Catley, said the Coalition had âfailedâ to provide an overarching policy and vowed to fix it if Labor forms government in a fortnight. âA future NSW Labor government will work with our federal government counterparts in responding to any specific concerns,â she said. Associate professor in national security at the University of Canberra, Dr Michael Jensen, believed the federal review would probably lead to a ban on government devices in commonwealth departments, with limited exceptions, and the states would probably follow. âI think that theyâll generally look to whatâs happening nationally,â he said. TikTok Australiaâs general manager, Lee Hunter, said TikTok was not a Chinese company, insisting it was a âglobalâ entity that stored the data of Aussie users in Singapore and the US. âThe Chinese government cannot compel another sovereign nation to provide data stored in that nationâs territory,â he said. âWe have, and will continue to, proactively engage with governments at all levels in areas of shared interest, and we are always available to answer questions they may have.â",Guardian,14/03/2023,NSW government considers banning TikTok on all public sector devices,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/14/nsw-government-considers-banning-tiktok-on-all-public-sector-devices
47,"UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has suggested that the UK may ban TikTok from government devices, following the lead of the US and Canada, due to concerns over its links to China. The European Commission and European Parliament have already implemented such bans. TikTok expressed disappointment and emphasized its commitment to addressing any concerns. The ban would not extend to personal devices, but advisory warnings would be issued. Last week, TikTok outlined its Project Clover plan to address European governments' security concerns.","Rishi Sunak has indicated that the UK could follow the US and Canada in banning TikTok from government devices, saying he will take âwhatever steps are necessaryâ to protect Britainâs security. The prime minister said the UK was âlooking at what our allies are doingâ in the wake of the decision by other countries to remove TikTok from government phones amid fears over the social video appâs links to China. The European Commission and European parliament have also banned TikTok from staff devices. Asked by ITV if the government was considering a ban, Sunak said: âWe want to make sure that we protect the integrity and security of sensitive information. And we will always do that and take whatever steps are necessary to make sure that happens.â In a further interview with the BBC, Sunak said: âWe take security of our devices seriously.â Earlier on Monday, TikTok said it would be âdisappointedâ if it was banned from UK government devices, after it was reported that ministers were about to do so. TikTok said such moves were based on âmisplaced fearsâ. The app is under pressure over its ownership by the Beijing-based ByteDance, with politicians on both sides of the Atlantic warning that the Chinese state could access its data or manipulate what people view on the app via its recommendation algorithm. The Sunday Times reported that a review of TikTok had been carried out by the government security group, a team within the Cabinet Office, and that the National Cyber Security Centre had identified security risks related to the app. A TikTok spokesperson said: âWhile we await details of any specific concerns the UK government may have, we would be disappointed by such a move. Similar decisions elsewhere have been based on misplaced fears and seemingly driven by wider geopolitics, but we remain committed to working with the government to address any concerns.â The report said the ban would not apply to the personal devices of ministers and civil servants, though advice would be issued to explain the risks of using the app. Hours before the Sunak interviews were broadcast, Downing Street had suggested no imminent changes were planned in the position on TikTok being installed on government phones. The prime ministerâs deputy official spokesperson said: âThereâs no change â¦ All departments have robust processes in place to ensure that IT devices are secure, including managing risks from third-party applications.â Last week, TikTok gave further details of its plan to assuage the concerns of European governments about the security of the platform. Entitled Project Clover, the framework includes the storage of user data on servers in Ireland and Norway at an annual cost of â¬1.2bn (Â£1.1bn), with any data transfers outside Europe being vetted by a third-party IT company. The outlines of a security deal have been thrashed out in the US but the White House has not approved the arrangement, which includes the tech firm Oracle storing TikTokâs data and scrutinising its source code. The US banned TikTok from federal government devices in December, and Canada and the EUâs executive arm followed suit last month.",Guardian,13/03/2023,Rishi Sunak hints at TikTok ban from UK government devices,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/13/tiktok-would-be-disappointed-if-uk-banned-app-on-official-devices
48,"TikTok has introduced Project Clover, a data security plan for Europe, in response to mounting political pressure and concerns over its Chinese ties. The project involves storing user data on servers in Ireland and Norway, with third-party monitoring of data transfers outside of Europe. TikTok denies the Chinese government's access to its data. The European Commission and Parliament have banned TikTok from work devices, while the US contemplates a ban. The UK, however, has rejected calls for a similar ban.","TikTok has announced a data security regime for protecting user information across Europe, as political pressure increases in the US to ban the social video app. The plan, known as Project Clover, involves user data being stored on servers in Ireland and Norway at an annual cost of â¬1.2bn (Â£1.1bn), while any data transfers outside Europe will be vetted by a third-party IT company. TikTok is under pressure in the US and Europe over its links to China via its Beijing-based parent, ByteDance. On Tuesday the White House gave its backing to a Senate bill that would give the administration the power to ban TikTok and on Wednesday the FBI director Christopher Wray told a Senate hearing that the app âscreamsâ of national security concerns. TikTok, which stores its global user data in the US and Singapore, has denied its data or algorithms can be accessed or manipulated by the Chinese government. âThe Chinese government have never asked us for data, and if they would we would refuse to do so,â said Theo Bertram, TikTokâs vice-president of government relations and public policy in Europe. TikTok, which has more than 1 billion users worldwide, has 150 million in Europe. TikTok had said it would store data in two servers in Ireland but announced on Wednesday that it would also use a datacentre in Norway for the same purpose under Project Clover. The use of the Irish and Norwegian data servers will cost TikTok â¬1.2bn a year. Under Clover, TikTokâs data controls and transfer of data outside of the continent will be monitored by a third-party European cybersecurity firm, although the company has yet to disclose the name of its security partner. TikTok said it would introduce âpseudonymisationâ of personal data so an individual could not be identified without additional information. Last year TikTok confirmed employees outside the continent, including in China, could access user data to ensure their experience of the platform was âconsistent, enjoyable and safeâ. It said European user data could be used to conduct checks on the performance of its algorithms, which recommend content to users, and tracking vexatious automated accounts. TikTokâs European proposals mirror a plan to reassure the US about user data, called Project Texas. Under the US plan, TikTok will store data from American users in the US on servers run by the tech firm Oracle. Oracle will also monitor TikTokâs algorithms and source code â to try to assuage concerns that the Chinese state could influence what people see on the app â as well as vetting updates and delivering them to the Google and Apple app stores. However, the proposals have not received political sign-off from the White House, amid fresh tensions between Washington and Beijing over the shooting down of a Chinese spy balloon off the US east coast. TikTokâs credibility was also damaged last year when ByteDance admitted employees had attempted to use the app to spy on reporters. Concerns about TikTokâs data have been heightened by fears that companies could be legally compelled to hand over data by the Chinese government, citing examples such as Chinaâs national intelligence law of 2017, which states that all organisations and citizens shall âsupport, assist and cooperateâ with national intelligence efforts. Last month the European Commission, the EUâs executive body, banned TikTok from work phones and devices, while the European parliament has also banned the app from staff phones. However, the UK has ruled out similar moves despite lobbying from Conservative politicians, including the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith. Michelle Donelan, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, said last month there were no grounds for a ban. âWe have no evidence to suggest there is a necessity to ban people from using TikTok. That would be a very, very forthright move â¦ that would require a significant evidence base to be able to do that,â she said.",Guardian,8/03/2023,TikTok unveils European data security plan amid calls for US ban,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/08/tiktok-european-data-security-regime-us-ban-social-video-app
49,"Several Australian government agencies have banned TikTok on government devices due to security concerns over the app's ties to China. However, experts argue that the focus should not solely be on TikTok but on all social media platforms, emphasizing the need to educate users about privacy risks. They suggest implementing stronger privacy laws, promoting encryption, and encouraging the use of technologies that safeguard data. The Department of Home Affairs is conducting a review of security risks across social media platforms, with a report expected soon.


","Federal department bans on using TikTok on Australian government-issued phones are sensible but should also apply to other social media apps, experts say. A growing number of Australian government agencies have begun banning the popular ByteDance app, amid security concerns over the companyâs ties to China and which data might be accessible to the Chinese government about TikTokâs users. The Canberra Times reported that almost half of the nearly 140 federal government agencies canvassed had banned the app on government-owned devices. While most of the focus from the opposition has been on TikTok alone, the Department of Home Affairs is undertaking a review at the request of the home affairs minister, Clare OâNeil, of the security risks of all social media platforms and the correct government settings. The report is due to be submitted in the first quarter of this year. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Experts say TikTok should not be the sole focus of bans from work devices. âI donât think itâs as simple as TikTok â bad; American companies â good,â said Prof Vanessa Teague, a cybersecurity researcher at the Australian National University. âI think theyâre all bad.â Teague said while Apple and Google now give users increasing powers to limit which information they provide to social media apps â such as location and contact information â the apps can and do still collect a wide array of information on users. âItâs all well and good to turn off location permission, but if you then upload a photo or a video that has your GPS coordinates â¦ then you told them where you are, so itâs better but it doesnât completely solve the problem.â Dr Abu Barkat Ullah, a cyber security associate professor at the University of Canberra, also warned of the risks of all apps. He said that while limiting which apps can be installed on work devices makes sense, people will still be providing a lot of information through their own personal devices. âWe need to be very much careful about the personal devices, what data we are exposing to outsiders,â he said. A TikTok spokesperson told Guardian Australia on Monday the company was ânot unique in how we operateâ. âSome of the best-known and trusted Australian companies, including banks and telcos, openly state in their privacy policies that they share Australian user information with employees and third parties around the world, including China,â the spokesperson said. âThese organisations often collect sensitive data like financial information, medical records, legal information and more. The TikTok app collects less data than many popular mobile apps.â The spokesperson added that the company would âcontinue to be diligent in ensuring we meet, or exceed, the data security standards applied to companies that operate in Australiaâ. In a submission in February to a Senate inquiry on foreign influence through social media, the companyâs director of public policy in Australia and New Zealand, Ella Woods-Joyce, said the company should not be a political football. âWe are proud of our heritage and itâs important to note that we operate no differently to other global companies and claims to the contrary are unsubstantiated by evidence,â she said. OâNeil has ruled out a wider ban on the app. âTikTok is one of the most widely used apps in Australia, much beloved by Australiaâs young people in particular. Itâs not currently on the table,â she told the ABC in February. The Liberal, Labor and Greens parties, as well as Pauline Hanson and Bob Katter, are all active on the app. One of the most prominent federal MPs on the app, Laborâs Julian Hill, has said he does not use the app on his government-issued phone. Teague and Ullah said the focus should be on educating Australians about privacy beyond TikTok, not just whether one app should be banned. âSometimes I say are we driving without seatbelts because everybody is using without knowing the challenges that lie behind [it],â Ullah said. âI donât actually think theyâre really solving the problem, unless theyâre solving the problem of Australiansâ privacy and security, which would mean strong privacy laws, better education, encouragement of end-to-end encryption and an end to this nonsense that encryption is only for paedophiles,â Teague said. âThey actually have to change their whole direction and start encouraging people to use technologies that secure our data.â",Guardian,7/03/2023,"TikTok bans on Australian government-issued phones should be extended to other apps, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/07/tiktok-bans-on-australian-government-issued-phones-should-be-extended-to-other-apps-experts-say

Protests are erupting in schools across England and Wales, with students participating in demonstrations against school rules, such as restricted toilet access. The protests are often sparked by videos shared on TikTok, which parents are applauding on social media. School leaders express concern about the potential escalation of protests and emphasize the importance of maintaining authority and student safety. Some schools have implemented toilet restrictions to address issues like bullying and drug use, while critics argue that such restrictions add pressure and hinder students' well-being.","The TikTok videos show pupils throwing bins, tables and even urine. Across England and Wales, a handful of schools have been hit by protests against rules such as banning trips to the toilet during lessons or regulations against rolled up skirts. Schools admit they are extremely worried about the copycat protests that have erupted in the last two weeks, typically sparked by videos shared on TikTok with many thousands of views. But what has shocked many leaders most is the number of parents on social media applauding pupils taking part. Headteachers told the Observer this weekend that parents were wrong to praise students who âstampededâ through schools, insisting school leaders have every right to use unpopular new rules to deal with behaviour such as vaping and bullying in toilets. Sam Strickland, principal of Duston school, an academy in Northampton that teaches children aged four to 19, told the Observer: âSome parents have been arguing that it is an infringement of human rights for schools to restrict toilet use during lessons. Thatâs ludicrous.â He argues that parents are âlegitimisingâ demonstrations that could quickly get out of hand and become a serious risk to young peopleâs safety, by openly questioning the fairness of school rules and the authority of teachers. He had a tipoff last weekend that some of his pupils were planning a protest, in part about the school telling pupils they could only use the toilet at break time. He said he decided âto take the bull by the hornsâ, confronting each of the secondary school year groups as they lined up in the playground first thing on Monday morning. âI looked at them and said: âI know about this. Donât do this.â I said we would either suspend or potentially permanently exclude anyone who took part in a protest,â he said. He reminded them that there were better channels through which to address their concerns, such as the student council or talking to their form teacher. The protest never materialised, but he thinks all schools are worried about the social media trend catching on. âIt is a fundamental safeguarding risk,â he said. âThere is nothing healthy about 200 kids stampeding through a school protesting. If it all goes wrong you also risk a safeguarding inspection visit from Ofsted. Itâs serious.â However, he is unapologetic about toilet regulations, pointing out that it is hugely disruptive if teachers are interrupted âevery two minutesâ by someone asking to go to the loo, and that schools are trying to rein in problems with bullying, vaping and drug use in unsupervised toilets. âWhen I was a kid you worried about getting your head flushed down the toilet at school. Now vaping is the big problem,â he said. âThe difference is that schools are now taking control of these issues.â Chris Stokes, principal of Farnley Academy in Leeds, wrote to parents on 24 February condemning a protest at his school that morning over locked toilets during lessons. A parent told the local newspaper the school was infringing young peopleâs human rights. Others backed her up on social media. But Stokes said in his letter that the decision to lock toilets had followed âtwo very serious safeguarding eventsâ. He wrote: âIt was a necessary decision to keep all pupils safe.â A school leader in the north of England told the Observer many schools are focusing on preventing bullying in toilets. âWe are looking at classic places like stairwells and toilets and PE changing rooms and putting things in place to make children safer.â To this end, the school, like a number of others, has taken the entry doors off its toilet blocks, which were being used for bullying and vaping. The school had heard rumours about a protest a week ago, but managed to head it off. The school leader insists they are not trying to suppress young peopleâs views. âOur job is to keep students safe. Some parents have been praising children on social media for protesting, but they arenât appreciating the risks and how quickly these situations can escalate.â Many schools have found themselves at the sharp end of such escalation. At Neale-Wade Academy in Fenland, reports on social media of a protest on 27 February referred to pupils throwing urine and bins. Principal Graham Horn had tried to prevent the protest about toilet restrictions by emailing parents asking them to encourage their children to have âsensible conversationsâ, but this didnât work. Penrice Academy in St Austell, Cornwall, confirmed last week it would expel some pupils after reports of protesters flipping tables and climbing fences. Meanwhile, Kentâs largest secondary school, Homewood school in Tenterden, had to call in the police to control a protest last Monday. In the local media, some parents were praising students for making their voices heard, but one said her daughter had told her some pupils were being sick because they were so anxious. A mother whose teenage daughter attends a large secondary school in the east of England told the Observer her daughter had opted out of a protest about locked toilets after they discussed it at home. Her daughter sheltered in a classroom for two hours with a few others while the protest was under way, but said more than half the school took part. The mother, who asked to remain anonymous, said: âFrankly, theyâre kids, and these arenât organised protests, but impulsive ones. Thanks to group psychology, they can turn real quick.â She said she understood why the school was taking action, after an expensive new block had been âtotally trashedâ, but she disagreed with banning their use outside break time. âItâs really irresponsible to deny toilets to girls who are just starting their periods,â she said. Charlotte Haines Lyon, senior lecturer in education at York St John University, said: âSchools are on their knees with no resources, so I absolutely understand why teachers would go and lock toilets to tackle problems.â But she recently surveyed nearly 200 parents about the school toilets debate and more than half of them reported that their child had avoided drinking so they would not need the toilet at school. âOne respondent said that if her child needed to use the toilet in lesson time, she had to get toilet paper from the office. Can you imagine how humiliating that would be?â she said. âAnd what about girls trying to get their heads around periods? Restricting toilets is just adding more pressure.â Thomas Michael, deputy safeguarding lead at a school in the West Midlands, said schools needed to make sure they explained the reasons behind changes to rules like these. But he said: âIn some schools, toilets are a dangerous place. Bullying, fighting, buying and selling drugs â it all takes place there and staff canât really monitor it, so you can understand their actions.â He added: âWhen you see people outside of education labelling this child abuse, it really hits those staff in tough schools who are trying to do right by all their pupils.â Will Teece, head of Brookvale Groby Learning Campus, a secondary academy in Leicester, said no one should be lauding students for rioting and damaging property: âYes, itâs really important to listen to studentsâ concerns, but adults are the ones in charge.â There has been talk of a protest at Teeceâs school, but nothing has happened yet. He has written to parents, and planned an assembly to discuss concerns, but said even doing that felt risky. âIf something is posted and shared and liked on TikTok, does that mean itâs real?â he said. âThere is a fear that by communicating about it you might fuel something that might never have taken off.â",Guardian,5/03/2023,Heads warn parents not to back pupil protests spreading via TikTok,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/mar/05/heads-uk-parents-pupil-protests-tiktok-stampedes-teachers-social-media
51,"Celebrity boxing, particularly in the influencer space, has evolved into a more serious and watchable sport. KSI, a prominent YouTuber and rapper, has played a pivotal role in its growth, with his fights drawing millions of viewers and generating substantial revenue. The rise of influencer boxing has sparked debates about its legitimacy and entertainment value. The sport has gained recognition, attracting a diverse audience and even catching the attention of mainstream celebrities.","Salt Papi, real name Busta Breezie, is a 28-year-old with slick dance moves, a pencil moustache and a mean left hook. He was born in the Philippines, moved to the UK as a teenager, and won fame â and a stage name â with his TikTok videos that parody Salt Bae, the celebrity Turkish chef known for ostentatiously sprinkling salt over meals. That, and videos in which he pretends to be running in slow motion. Papi used to be the âchubbyâ kid at school â fast food was his jam. Now heâs licking his lips as he dances around a boxing ring in Wembley Arena with Josh Brueckner, a YouTuber and MMA fighter with a cut-glass jaw and abs coming out of his ears. Itâs not boxing as you know it, but Wembley Arena is packed â 10,000 people on the edge of their seats. Weâre midway through an undercard that features a string of match-ups between vloggers, TikTok stars, Love Island-ers and OnlyFans creators. It will culminate in a headline bout between KSI, the 29-year-old rapper, YouTuber and co-owner of the energy drink Prime, and FaZe Temperrr, a pro Call of Duty player and co-owner of one of the worldâs biggest esports organisations, FaZe Clan. âWatch it,â KSI told me in the days leading up to the fight, acknowledging the anarchy of the operation, âItâs all over the place.â Beyond the venue, 300,000 people on either side of the Atlantic are doing just that, having paid to tune into the action from their homes. Many more, I imagine, are watching via unofficial channels. And whatâs not to like? Ripped internet celebs! Viral violence! Social-media spats! Knockouts! If you were going to bottle late 2010s to roaring-20s culture and send it to space so that aliens could understand the vibes, this is what youâd put in the bottle. Itâs the strangest concoction of what could vaguely pass as family entertainment currently streaming to a teenager near you. You donât need John Prescott to tell you that everyone loves to see public figures swing punches, and celebrity boxing â in the organised sense â has been around for decades. In the past these fixtures havenât made the easiest viewing. When Fox aired Celebrity Boxing, in 2002, the pairings were bleak. Tonya Harding, the disgraced figure skater, was pitched against Paula Jones, a civil servant known for suing Bill Clinton for sexual harassment. Season two (two!) sunk television programming to the depths of the Mariana Trench with a fight between Joey Buttafuoco, a tabloid villain from Long Island who had been convicted for statutory rape and shooting his wife, and Chyna, a female professional wrestler. Buttafuoco won, and used the platform to say heâd been screwed by the legal system. There was truly nothing to feel good about. A string of charity and exhibition matches followed. Millions watched Ricky Gervais fight Grant Bovey, which Frank Warren, the boxing promoter, said made a farce of this ânoble artâ. After outrage from the British Board of Boxing, future fights in the series were cancelled. Subsequent events involving celebs were pretty shallow: flash-in-the-pan pop culture moments youâd soon forget had ever happened (or wish hadnât). But this new incarnation of celebrity boxing, drawing on the vast pool of internet stars, is coalescing into something more sustained. And, strangely, genuinely watchable. It started in 2018. Simmering internet beef between KSI, real name Olajide âJJâ Olatunji, and another British YouTuber, Joe Weller, boiled over into an organised bout that was streamed by millions. After his victory, KSI took the opportunity to call out two of the worldâs biggest internet celebrities â Jake and Logan Paul, the fair-haired bros from Ohio with a vast following (and a long list of controversies to their name). They were game. As Jake would later tell the New Yorker: âOne thing that is great about being a fighter is, like, you canât get cancelled.â A few months later an amateur fight was held at Manchester Arena. KSI faced Logan Paul (it was a draw) and KSIâs brother, Deji, took on Jake (who won). It was touted as the âbiggest internet event in historyâ and drew the eyes of millions, including those of Eddie Hearn, who leapt in to set up a professional fight for the pair at the Staples Center in Los Angeles the following year. It was a roaring success, delighting as many viewers as it provoked, unlocking with it a Pandoraâs box of debate that swaggers jauntily around the influencer boxing scene to this day. Is it legitimate boxing? Is proper boxing boring? What even is âproperâ boxing? To those involved, mere tittle tattle. Two million people paid to view the fight, millions more streamed it illegally. It pulled in an estimated Â£150m. Ding, ding, ding. In the years since, YouTuber, influencer or crossover boxing, whatever you choose to call it, has grown in stature, with more fights and more fans. It has become increasingly difficult to ignore, even for the most ignorant (and by that, I mean, most people over the age of 30). The audience at Wembley Arena boasts a uniquely broad spectrum of stars, some of whom I would look straight through were it not for Brent Jennings, a 24-year-old student from London, sitting next to me. Heâs been tuned into these guys for years, paid Â£400 for a ringside seat and tells me itâs money well spent. For starters, Jennings is pumped to be mere feet away from Danny Aarons, a 20-year-old Fifa streamer with half a million subscribers on YouTube and Twitch, quietly seated in the row ahead. Jenningsâs younger brother watches this guy âfor breakfast, lunch and dinnerâ, Iâm told. He flicks open his phone to show me Aaronâs YouTube page. âMad!â He asks Aarons for a selfie. Shortly after, Aarons leans forward to ask for a selfie with the woman in front of him. Itâs Holly Willoughby. She obliges. On the other side of the ring (beyond a smattering of Love Island-ers, KSIâs YouTube crew the Sidemen and members of FaZe Clan) is Louis Theroux. Krishnan Guru-Murthy is also there with his children. So is Katie Price. Thereâs boxing royalty, like Michael Buffer, in a paisley tux, here to announce the headline billing; Derek Chisora, in shades and a beanie. Rappers like Jme and AJ Tracey. Vape smoke wafts in from behind me where a group of friends converse in a huddle: âI swear that guy used to review chicken wings.â They peer down the aisle: itâs Elijah Quashie (the Chicken Connoisseur) best known for his YouTube series, the Pengest Munch. Who isnât here? Up by the bar, Brian Michael Hinds, AKA the Bottom G, AKA the Gay Andrew Tate â who went viral last summer for performing a mocking TikTok dance of his controversial doppelganger â is having a dance-off with a bloke who also seems to be cosplaying as Tate with the help of a prosthetic scalp and a pair of aviators. Everybody gathers round to cheer, phones out, filming. Celebrity, clearly, is evolving, but celebrity boxing is evolving, too. What was once a degrading spectacle is now a (sort of) serious sport. As the players throw themselves into training camps, the quality of the scraps has sharpened. Jake Paul, in particular, has gained notoriety as a credible fighter (even Logan lasted the full eight rounds in an exhibition match with Floyd Mayweather Jr). The transatlantic rivalry between Jake Paul and KSI, household names who both remain undefeated, provides an enticing narrative engine with which to drum up attention for all involved. KSI v Jake Paul is touted to take place later this year. If previous fights have lit up the internet, this one will probably break it. In the meantime, KSI is at the heart of those hoping to build something bigger than his imminent grand duel. In 2021, Misfits Boxing was launched. Itâs a collaboration between KSIâs management company, Proper Loud, and boxing promoters the Sauerland Brothers (now under the fold of Wasserman Boxing). The fights â featuring an expanding roster of creators to porn stars, rappers to MMA fighters â have been raucous, even if the boxing itself is questionable. In January, after a string of successful pay-per-view events, Misfits and DAZN, the streaming platform, announced a five-year exclusivity deal. The people with the purse strings seem to think they are on to something. Could influencer boxing be here to stay? Three days before the fight, KSI is leaning back in his chair, dressed in a gleaming white suit with a pink pocket square and a chain around his neck. The two of us are in a small room in Wembley Boxpark, where a press conference is due to be held as part of the promotional buildup. He exudes calm and focus â this past week has been pretty chill, Iâm told. Watching TV, playing video games, shooting some content. None of the pre-fight nerves he used to get. âIt helps when you train hard,â says KSI. âIâve done about 111 rounds of boxingâ¦ not even light workâ¦ where theyâre trying to knock my head offâ¦ and Iâm surviving and holding my own.â The commitment among the fighters is commendable (Jake Paul trains at night to acclimatise himself to fight schedules). But people arenât watching because they expect something balletic, right? âIâm not trying to compete with traditional boxing,â says KSI, as a young guy in a hoodie sneaks in behind him and leaves clutching bottles of Prime. âThis is about who can be the most entertaining. Who can talk the talk and walk the walk, and be entertaining along the way. And thatâs why people are so obsessed with it.â The rivalries in this rolling soap opera can seem artificial â Jake Paul may be KSIâs arch nemesis, but it hasnât stopped him partnering with Logan to launch Prime â but whatâs wrong with a bit of theatre? Pro wrestling, such as WWE, is completely scripted, but has absolute buy-in from its audience. The ârealnessâ is irrelevant. In that sense, Misfits seems to be built on an understanding that the best sporting events are not simply about who is the best physically, but about the storytelling and characters behind it. As KSI puts it: âWe want to be the WWE of boxing.â The press conference commences and the stars of the Misfits universe vie for attention. Each has their own narrative, each moulded to fit an archetype (though arguably the one archetype they all fit is âcreatorâ). Thereâs Elle Brooke, a TikTok and OnlyFans star from Surrey, sauntering around in a tiara and âBirthday Girlâ sash. Anthony âPretty Boyâ Taylor, an MMA fighter from California with a pencil moustache and red velvet smoking jacket. Ryan Taylor, a pro BMX rider from Walsall, lumbering about in a white furry bucket hat shouting back at taunts. On stage, each takes their turn to square up, shout profanities, call out new names for fights and blow out their 15 minutes of fame. When KSI and FaZe Temperrr take to the stage, Anthony Taylor interrupts from the balcony. âWhat about me?â he yells, waving a bottle of Prime. âWhat about me?!â Cheering and jeering is a throng of fans in Dragon Ball Z hoodies, Drew House sweatshirts and 50 shades of North Face jacket. There is also a junket of vloggers, part of the self-sustaining media ecosystem fuelling the sport. These are largely fronted by teenagers, some of whom get more privileged access than the mainstream press. Like Fox Townley, who goes by the handle FoxTheG, a lean 17-year-old with long blond hair and a baseball cap with his moniker on it. He was actually flown over from the US by Misfits to film content around the fight, he tells me, and is there with his mum, Avian Townley, 48, who looks a little out of place in her red-checked shirt and Kanken rucksack. âI do not understand about 85% of what the hell is happening,â she says. âBut Iâm very proud.â The following morning, the cast arrives for weigh-in. Cue more showboating and a stage invasion by Likkleman, a 3ft-tall fighter with half a million Instagram followers. Enjoying the spectacle are Kalle Sauerland and Mams Taylor, a pop producer and owner of Proper Loud, who was raised on a diet of WWE. The duo â dressed in Misfits brand tracksuit â are bridging the two worlds. âLetâs not beat around the bush,â says Sauerland, who ducks and dives like heâs dodging punches when he talks. âIt draws numbers that very few entertainment sport segments could dream of reaching.â Now heâs getting calls from all sorts: âmainstream celebrities, footballers, athletes, actors, actressesâ¦â Taylor chips in: âPeople youâd never dream ofâ¦ I canât even tell you.â So whatâs changed? What makes this so desirable while celebrity boxing in the past has been associated with Z-listers chasing cash? âThis rabid fanbaseâ says Taylor. âIf you connect with those kids, theyâll buy your products. Theyâll watch your TV show. Theyâll follow you.â He looks at me from under his black cowboy hat, through a pair of blacked-out shades printed with the Louis Vuitton logo. âThe uncool has become cool.â Those representing the established sport have their reservations. Last year Jake Wood, the EastEnders actor and co-host of the Pound for Pound boxing podcast, tweeted that YouTuber boxing âundermines what professional boxers and boxing stands forâ. Others have taken offence at influencers calling out professionals for a fight. âKnow your limit,â Carl Frampton, a former pro boxer, said on the William Hill Stripped podcast. But increasingly, thereâs a muted respect. âItâs not boxing, itâs barely even fighting in some cases,â wrote Matt Christie in Boxing News. âBut when the fans â those who pay â are happy and not constantly moaning about everything being a waste of money, then âcelebrity boxingâ is doing something that âreal boxingâ is not.â Andy Clarke, a boxing commentator who was covering the fight at Wembley for talkSPORT, told me that it used to make him uncomfortable. âI worried that if someone suffered an injury, proper boxing would carry the can for it,â he said. âBut as long as they are trying to make it as safe as possible, just as they do with pro boxing, amateur boxing, white-collar boxing â which happens up and down the country every weekend â then you canât ask for too much more than that.â Besides, says Clarke, since Misfits was set up, it has forged its own identity and community: âIt just exists in its own crazy bubble.â Finally, fight night. In the warren of corridors and dressing rooms behind Wembley Arena, the fighters prep for their moment. Glove up. Flurry about for a last moment of shadow boxing. Out on the streets a queue snakes from the building. There are men in sharp suits, women in stilettos, but between the glitz are awkward kids chasing their dads, and teenagers making their first trip to London. Sauerland was right. Unlike the usual boxing match, people really do show up early for the undercards. From 7pm the stadium is energised, though the age of the audience skews far younger than your usual boxing crowd. Some fights are forgettable, others magnetic. KSI, as promised, wins his fight against FaZe Temperrr after an impressive first-round knockout. But by then itâs clear that other fighters are rising up â in this strange new sporting universe, at least â with unexpected talent and unmistakable star quality. That, undeniably, comes from Salt Papi. He showboats his way through his first round with Josh Brueckner, dropping his arms to hop a playful toe-to-toe jig before sharing a smile with the crowd. He has their undivided attention. Moments into round two, and itâs all over; Papiâs southpaw sends Brueckner to the deck. He slices a finger across his throat, raises his gloves in victory and swaggers back to his corner to return his wire-framed spectacles to his nose. Not for the first time that evening, Jennings leaps out of his seat, waving his phone in the air. âSalt Papi, heâs the killer!â Itâs not that he doesnât love âproperâ boxing too, itâs just that this has an extra layer to it. Following the stars as they train, watching their journey, their physical transformation, their beef, their banter, is a big part of it. Salt Papi, the chubby kid from school, the TikTok jesterâ¦ now heâs winning praise from the likes of Chris Eubank Jr. Even Eddie Hearn is tempted. âI want to turn Salt Papi pro,â he said recently. âHeâs a man of the people.â Itâs a fable for our time.",Guardian,5/03/2023,"KSI, Logan Paul, Salt Papi: the influencers redefining boxing for the TikTok generation",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/05/fight-for-your-likes-the-rise-of-the-youtube-boxers
52,"TikTok is facing pressure from organizations like NSPCC and the Molly Rose Foundation to improve content moderation regarding suicide and eating disorder material. Research suggests that TikTok's algorithm quickly pushes harmful content to teenagers expressing interest in self-harm and eating disorders. The organizations urge TikTok to take meaningful action, including better moderation, collaboration with experts, and support for affected users. TikTok's response to previous research has been criticized, and concerns about harmful content persist.","TikTok has been urged to strengthen its content moderation policies around suicide and eating disorder material by organisations including the NSPCC and the Molly Rose Foundation. The groups claimed TikTok had not acted swiftly enough following the publication of research suggesting the appâs recommendation algorithm pushes self-harm and eating disorder content to teenagers within minutes of them expressing interest in the topics. In a letter to TikTokâs head of safety, the organisations asked the app to take âmeaningful actionâ including: improving moderation of eating disorder and suicide content; working with experts to develop a âcomprehensiveâ approach to removing harmful content; supporting users who may be struggling with eating disorders or suicidal thoughts; and regular reporting on the steps being taken to address those issues. The signatories, more than two dozen organisations that also include the American Psychological Association and the US Eating Disorders Coalition, claim TikTok has removed just seven of the 56 coded eating disorder hashtags highlighted in research published in December by the campaign group the Center for Countering Digital Hate. CCDH said there had been 1.6bn further views of those hashtags since November last year. âSince CCDHâs report was released in December 2022, you have chosen to deny the problem, deflect responsibility, and delay taking any meaningful action,â said the groups in a letter to the TikTok safety boss, Eric Han. Responding to the CCDH report last year, TikTok said the research, which used fake accounts that dwelt on videos about body image, eating disorders and mental health in order to test the responsiveness of the appâs recommendation algorithm, did not reflect the experience or viewing habits of its real-life users. The letter was disclosed in the same week that TikTok, which has more than 1 billion users worldwide, said it would limit teenagers joining the app to an hour of use each day. However, the restriction can be changed or removed in the appâs settings. A spokesperson for TikTok said many people who struggled with, or were recovering from, eating disorders used the app for support. âOur community guidelines are clear that we do not allow the promotion, normalisation or glorification of eating disorders, and we have removed content mentioned in this report that violates these rules. We are open to feedback and scrutiny, and we seek to engage constructively with partners who have expertise on these complex issues, as we do with NGOs in the US and UK,â said the spokesperson. In the UK, the youth suicide charity Papyrus can be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or email pat@papyrus-uk.org.

53,"The recent Chinese spy balloon incident has raised concerns about TikTok's future. A US congressional committee supported legislation that could give the president the power to ban the app due to fears of Chinese state surveillance. Canada and the EU have also imposed restrictions on TikTok. Efforts to ban the app face opposition from free speech groups and concerns about broad sanctions. TikTok denies Chinese state access to data, but its credibility was damaged by employee spying allegations.","The Chinese spy balloon that hovered over the US last month did not just damage relations between Beijing and Washington, it also cast a shadow over the future of TikTok. Last week, a US congressional committee backed legislation that would give the US president the power to ban the Chinese-owned social video app. The Republican chair of the committee, Michael McCaul, said the incident had reinforced fears of Chinese state surveillance, describing TikTok as a âspy balloon in your phoneâ. It came days after Canada announced it would join the US in barring TikTok from government mobile devices because of security concerns. The EUâs executive arm and the European parliament have also banned the app from staff phones. TikTok faces the threat of these narrow bans escalating. Banning the app entirely would leave a big gap in the social media consumption of the US alone, where TikTok has more than 100 million users. Canadaâs prime minister, Justin Trudeau, was ambivalent about going further. âThis may be the first step, this may be the only step we need to take,â he said. McCaulâs bill has some way to go before becoming law, requiring approval by both legislative bodies in Congress before reaching Joe Biden, but it joins other pieces of legislation with similar aims. In the Senate, the Republican Josh Hawley has introduced an act to ban TikTok nationwide, while fellow Republican senator Marco Rubio is behind similar legislation. The US ban of TikTok on federal devices adds to similar measures by a host of states including Texas, South Dakota and Virginia that prohibited state employees from using the app on their government-issued devices. Free speech groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) are on alert as efforts to ban TikTok progress, arguing it would violate first amendment rights. McCaulâs bill, which moved more quickly than the ACLU anticipated, is also overly broad and would impose sanctions on any company that may be directly or indirectly âsubject to the influence of Chinaâ, according to the ACLU senior policy counsel, Jenna Leventoff. That could âloop in a lot of companies outside of TikTokâ, she said. It is unclear how a US-wide ban on TikTok would be implemented and the bill provides few guidelines or limitations. âIt means that they can do whatever they think they need to do to prevent citizens from engaging with a company that meets the relevant criteria,â Leventoff said. The text of McCaulâs bill quotes Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, who warns that TikTokâs parent is âcontrolled by the Chinese governmentâ. He said the Chinese state can influence people by manipulating the algorithm that curates what people view on TikTok, as well as giving the government the opportunity to collect user data for âtraditional espionage operationsâ. TikTok has denied that its data, or algorithm, is accessed by the Chinese state. Last year it was reported that the US tech firm Oracle had begun auditing TikTokâs algorithms and content moderation models to ensure they were not being manipulated by Chinese authorities. Despite longstanding scepticism about TikTokâs independence from the Chinese state, no hard evidence has been produced to prove there has been state access to its user data or the appâs algorithm. However, TikTokâs credibility was damaged last year when its parent company, ByteDance, admitted employees had attempted to use the app to spy on reporters as part of a leak investigation. Four staff members were fired as a result. But Leventoff argues the collection and sharing of user data is not just a TikTok problem; it is an industry-wide problem and one that requires an industry-wide solution such as a federal data privacy law, which the US does not currently have. The committee vote and phone bans have taken place against the backdrop of an investigation into TikTok by the committee on foreign investment in the US [CFIUS], which reviews investments by foreign entities in US businesses. TikTok believes it had an outline deal in place with CFIUS. Its key components are: TikTok will store data from American users in the US on servers run by Oracle; Oracle will monitor TikTokâs algorithms and source code; Oracle will vet app updates and deliver them to the Google and Apple app stores; and TikTok will create a board of security experts that will oversee its US operations and report to the US government. A TikTok spokesperson said: âWe are two years and $1.5bn [Â£1.25bn] deep into a project to go above and beyond existing law to secure the US version of the TikTok platform. The swiftest and most thorough way to address national security concerns is for CFIUS to adopt the proposed agreement that we worked with them on for nearly two years.â However, the process appears to be in limbo as it awaits signoff from the White House, in the shadow of a surveillance balloon. âThe Oracle deal would mitigate any risk and would work, but itâs got an uphill battle to win political acceptance,â said James Lewis, a senior vice-president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a US thinktank. In the UK, the director of the spy agency GCHQ, Jeremy Fleming, said last year he would not be concerned if his children used TikTok. However, a group of Conservative politicians, including the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith MP, have urged Downing Street and senior ministers to shut down their TikTok accounts after parliament closed its own account in August last year following a lobbying campaign. Duncan Smith said TikTok should be banned on government devices and ministersâ personal telephones because the app is a âthreatâ and a âdata harvesterâ. Citing Chinaâs national intelligence law of 2017, which states that all organisations and citizens must cooperate with national intelligence efforts, he added: âChinese companies must support the Chinese intelligence services whenever required.â However, a UK ban has been ruled out by Michelle Donelan, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology. Speaking to Politico this week, she said: âWe have no evidence to suggest that there is a necessity to ban people from using TikTok. That would be a very, very forthright move â¦ that would require a significant evidence base to be able to do that.â",Guardian,3/03/2023,âSpy balloon in your phoneâ: growing calls to ban TikTok threaten its future,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/03/spy-balloon-phone-growing-calls-ban-tiktok-threaten-future
54,"The US House foreign affairs committee has supported legislation that would grant President Joe Biden the power to ban TikTok and other apps considered security risks. The bill must still pass through the House and Senate. Canada and the EU have already banned TikTok from government devices. Supporters of the ban argue that the Chinese government could access user data or manipulate public opinion, while TikTok denies these allegations. Critics warn of potential First Amendment violations. TikTok has expressed disappointment with the legislation.


","A powerful US House committee has applied further pressure to TikTok by backing legislation that could give Joe Biden the power to ban the social video app. The House foreign affairs committee voted on Wednesday along party lines to grant the administration new powers to ban the Chinese-owned app as well as other apps believed to pose security risks. The fate of the measure is still uncertain and it would need to be passed by the full House and Senate before it can go to Biden. The Republican committee chair, Michael McCaul, described TikTok this week as a âspy balloon in your phoneâ, referring to the Chinese surveillance balloon that was shot down off the coast of South Carolina last month. Democrats on the committee voted against McCaulâs deterring Americaâs technological adversaries act but Republican lawmakers pushed it through 24 to 16. The committee vote came in the same week that Canada joined the US in banning TikTok from being installed on all government-issued mobile devices, due to security concerns. The European Commission has also banned TikTok from staff phones. Politicians who support the TikTok bans have expressed concerns that the Chinese government could access user data or manipulate public opinion via the app â accusations that TikTok denies. On Monday the British government said there was no evidence of the need for a TikTok ban. âWe have no evidence to suggest that there is a necessity to ban people from using TikTok,â the UKâs secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, Michelle Donelan, told Politico. âThat would be a very, very forthright move, that would require a significant evidence base to be able to do that.â McCaul told Reuters after the vote that he thinks the TikTok bill will be taken up on the floor âfairly soonâ and voted on by the full House this month. He said this week that Democrats would prefer to rely on a security review of TikTok being undertaken by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, although an approved plan has yet to emerge from that process. Representative Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House foreign affairs committee, said he opposed the legislation because it would âdamage our allegiances across the globe, bring more companies into Chinaâs sphere, destroy jobs here in the United States and undercut core American values of free speech and free enterpriseâ. TikTok has around 110 million users in the US, according to analytics firm data.ai, and more than 1 billion worldwide. In a letter sent to McCaul this week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) warned that the legislation was âvague and overbroadâ and would âviolate the First Amendment rights of millions of Americans who use TikTok to communicate, gather information, and express themselves dailyâ. TikTok, which is owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, said it was âdisappointedâ to see the legislation being brought forward. âA US ban on TikTok is a ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion-plus people who use our service worldwide. Weâre disappointed to see this rushed piece of legislation move forward, despite its considerable negative impact on the free speech rights of millions of Americans who use and love TikTok,â said a TikTok spokesperson. On Tuesday a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said banning TikTok on US government devices revealed Washingtonâs own insecurities and was an abuse of state power.

55,"TikTok will implement default screen time restrictions for users under 18, limiting their usage to one hour per day. However, users can manually change or remove these limits. If a user exceeds 100 minutes of daily usage after removing the limit, they will be prompted to set a new restriction. Parents can utilize the ""family pairing"" feature to set stricter restrictions that cannot be overridden. The move aligns with new requirements for technology companies to be more mindful of children's online activities.","Teenagers joining TikTok will be limited to an hour of use each day, the social media company has announced â but only for as long as it takes them to realise they can change the settings manually. New default screen time restrictions will be enabled for every account known to belong to someone under 18, the company says. After the first hourâs use each day, the app will warn them their time is up, âso itâs easier to log offâ. But parents praying for an intervention â or young people struggling with their own compulsive behaviour â might find the relief is shortlived, since the restriction can be altered or removed altogether in the appâs settings. If the user removes the limit and then goes on to use the app for more than 100 minutes a day, it will prompt them to set a new restriction, which TikTok says will at least require them to make an active decision on their continued usage. Parents wanting restrictions that cannot be overridden can make use of the appâs âfamily pairingâ features, allowing them to link their own TikTok account to their childâs. These have been updated to allow a more rigorous restriction to be set. With a family pairing account, parents can set a custom screen-time limit for their children that cannot be overridden. They can also set a custom schedule to mute notifications, ensuring their children are not disturbed late at night. âWhile thereâs no collectively endorsed position on how much screen time is âtoo muchâ, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we recognise that teens typically require extra support as they start to explore the online world independently,â said Cormac Keenan, the companyâs head of trust and safety. âResearch also shows that being more aware of how we spend our time can help us be more intentional about the decisions we make, and this is especially important but typically more difficult for younger audiences.â Social networks have a strong motivation to offer their own screen-time controls, in case people decide to activate the stricter controls built into both the iOS and Android smartphone platforms. New requirements introduced in 2021 require technology companies to be more aware of how their services are used by children.

This week the European Commission decided to suspend the use of TikTok on devices issued to staff and even personal phones if they have official apps installed, following Washingtonâs ban last year on federal employees using the app on work devices. However, the prime minister is currently resisting pressure to bar parliamentary staff and MPs from using TikTok, which has become increasingly popular among UK politicians. A No 10 spokesperson said he was ânot awareâ of any ban on Downing Street staff using the platform. âWe [No 10] have got a TikTok account, but I donât think weâve put anything on it for a little while now,â he said. âItâs for individual departments and ministers to choose which social media platforms they want to use.â On Thursday, the Conservative MP Luke Evans posted a 48-second video on the app, showing his 41,000-strong following what it is like going through security to get into No 10. Alicia Kearns, the chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, told the Guardian: âWeâve now seen both the EU and US take decisive action on TikTok over security concerns: the acquisition of our personal data by a hostile state. We run the risk of becoming a tech security laggard amongst free and open nations. âThe government needs to reconsider its policies and move to ban government officials and parliamentary staff from installing the app on any mobile phones utilised for work. We need an informed discussion across our country, including with our children, about the importance of our data and all it can reveal about us, and how it can make us vulnerable.â Tim Loughton, the Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, urged the prime minister to take âconcerted actionâ against Chinese state threats. He said TikTok was in effect a âmega state-affiliated data harvesting organisationâ that the UK should not deal with on an equivalent basis to other western multinational companies. The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith added: âEven when their western security operatives show that TikTok poses a security risk to us in the UK, we seem to drag our feet, trying not to take action that might upset China. âThe prime minister has an opportunity to take control of China policy and itâs a critical time to do so. I hope the government owns up to the danger China poses and takes action immediately on TikTok.â Last year, parliamentâs TikTok account was shut down after Kearns and a number of Conservative MPs raised concerns on the firmâs links to China. A letter last summer from Duncan Smith, the foreign affairs select committee chair, Tom Tugendhat, and the 1922 Committee vice-chair Nus Ghani claimed that âdata security risks associated with the app are considerableâ. The former health secretary and reality TV contestant Matt Hancock is a regular user, while the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, also has an account. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said he did not have TikTok and that it was important to be âcarefulâ about any social media site. âTikTok is overall owned by a Chinese company and I think if you put your data on there you are not just sharing it with the person publishing it. The caution is, be careful what you put on these things,â he told LBC.",Guardian,24/02/2023,Rishi Sunak faces calls to ban TikTok use by government officials,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/24/rishi-sunak-tiktok-cybersecurity-uk-government-officials-china
58,"The European Commission has banned its staff from using TikTok due to cybersecurity concerns, a move criticized by TikTok as ""misguided."" The ban requires employees to delete the app from work and personal devices linked to the commission. ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, denies data security issues and has emphasized efforts to enhance security and store user data locally. Governments in Europe and the US have also limited TikTok use by employees over fears of data access by China.","The EUâs executive body has banned its thousands of staff from using TikTok over cybersecurity concerns, a decision the Chinese-owned social video app has criticised as âmisguidedâ and based on âfundamental misconceptionsâ. The European Commission sent an email to employees ordering them to delete the app from all work phones and devices, and any personally owned ones that use the commissionâs apps and email. Employees have until 15 March to comply. A spokesperson said: âThis measure aims to protect the commission against cybersecurity threats and actions which may be exploited for cyber-attacks against the corporate environment of the commission. The security developments of other social media platforms will also be kept under constant review.â The commission said it had enacted the ban in line with its âstrict internal cybersecurity policiesâ and longstanding advice to staff to âapply best practices when using social media platforms and keep high-level of cyber awareness in their daily work. âIt is therefore our duty to respond as early as possible to potential cyber alerts,â the spokesperson said. ByteDance, the privately owned parent company of TikTok, has denied there were any data security concerns related to its products and said it wanted to âset the record straightâ with the commission. âWe are disappointed with this decision, which we believe to be misguided and based on fundamental misconceptions,â said a spokesperson for TikTok. âWe have contacted the commission to set the record straight and explain how we protect the data of the 125 million people across the EU who come to TikTok every month.â ByteDance said it was continuing to strengthen its approach to security, including recently announcing the establishment of three new datacentres in Europe to ensure usersâ information was stored locally and not exported to foreign jurisdictions, such as China. The company is also reducing employee access to data â an internal report released by ByteDance in December found that four employees violated policies by inappropriately accessing data on TikTok users in the US â and âminimising data flows outside of Europeâ. Governments and officials in Europe and the US have taken similar steps to the commission to limit use of the app by employees amid fears that data may be accessed by Beijing. Last summer, a lobbying campaign by Conservative MPs resulted in the closure of the @ukparliament TikTok account. In the US, TikTok has been banned on all federal government devices, and most US states have imposed similar bans.

59,"A study by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism reveals that social media platforms, particularly TikTok and YouTube, have become significant news sources for young people. Combined with Facebook and Twitter, these platforms account for 66% of young people's main news sources. However, reliance on algorithm-driven content has led to polarized views and a lack of diverse news coverage. The increase in poor information poses a greater threat to society than climate change, according to a geography teacher.","Your editorial on disinformation (17 February) highlights a great challenge, but of arguably greater importance are the sources of news young people use. In a 2022 study, the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford provided quantitative evidence on the growth of social media as a news source for 18- to 24-year-olds. TikTok as a source had increased fivefold between 2020 and 2022, and YouTube stabilised its share of young readers in Asia, the fastest growing populace in the world. Combined with Facebook and Twitter, these sources supply 66% of young people their main news source, and all rely on algorithms. To increase views, clicks and advertising revenues, they show stories that viewers want to see â and slant viewpoints further. The result? Increasingly polarised and conflicting views in society, as people are exposed to a less diverse diet of actual current affairs. As a geography teacher, I regularly ask students how they access news. Sadly, it is now rare that one hand will be raised when I ask about mainstream and unsponsored sources. We have accepted that reading newspapers comes with political and social angles, but social media exacerbates this further by denying broad coverage. I am often asked about my greatest fear for the future. Rather than climate change, I reply âpoor informationâ, as this increasingly undermines cooperation and good citizenship that we, as an ingenious species, can use to solve global problems.

Hazel and Holly, two mountain lion cubs rescued by the Oakland Zoo in California, have gained popularity on social media. The abandoned cubs, separated from their mothers, have formed a close bond and attract millions of views as they play and cuddle together. Their celebrity status raises awareness about the challenges faced by the mountain lion species, including vehicle collisions and habitat loss. The zoo hopes to eventually reintroduce rehabilitated cubs into the wild, emphasizing the need for wildlife overpasses to mitigate collisions.","The internet has a new favorite pair of celebrity cats: Hazel and Holly, two mountain lion cubs whose recovery journey at a California zoo has attracted a loyal following. The abandoned cubs were brought in just a few days apart to the Oakland zoo, after wildlife officials realized they had been separated from their mothers. They have since forged a close bond, racking up millions of views on the Oakland zooâs social media pages where viewers watch them cuddle and wrestle together. They are âgrowing quite fond of each otherâ, the Oakland zoo said in a 11 February Facebook post. The duo arenât the first California mountain lions the public has fallen for â celeb cat P-22 lived in Los Angelesâ Griffith Park for a decade and made headlines every time he was spotted. Their influencer status could help raise awareness of an animal that is facing grave challenges: deaths from vehicle collisions and a dwindling habitat that causes inbreeding threaten the species in the near term. The cubs were both rescued from the Santa Cruz mountains by Californiaâs department of fish and wildlife. When cubs are brought in, they are generally emaciated and starving, says Oakland zoo veterinarian Alex Herman, and they also usually have anemia. Sometimes the wildlife officials know what happened with the mother, but other times itâs a mystery, Herman says. âItâs technically called maternal neglect and I hate that term â but they were separated,â she says. Fish and wildlife officials donât take the situation lightly â if they get a report of a cub alone they set up cameras and monitor the area for days to ensure there isnât a returning mother. Thatâs important because once cubs come into a zoo for care, they generally canât return to the wild for the rest of their lives. In Hazelâs and Hollyâs cases, their mothers never returned. And for Hazel, who arrived in early January, it was particularly grim. âWe couldnât believe she could even walk in her condition,â says Herman, adding that the vets assign a body score to animals, with 10 being obese and 1 being emaciated â and Hazel was clearly a 1. âShe was literally skin and bones, and needed a blood transfusion as soon as she arrived.â Holly also had no parents around and was rescued in late December, when she was about three or four months old. Each mountain lion has their own personality â Hazel is super curious and self-reliant and Holly is more reserved and tough, Herman says. âThey are definitely charismatic and clearly individuals.â Since 2017, the zoo has cared for 24 mountain lions in its 17,000 sq ft hospital, says Herman â and it hasnât always been straightforward. The longest a mountain lion was in the intensive care area was 34 days: that was Cal, who was treated for burns on his feet after the Zogg fire in 2020. He required daily care and anesthesia to change the bandages. âCal just was an easygoing guy,â says Herman. âWe had to do so much to save his life and he was the most forgiving and friendly.â In addition to healthcare, the rescued animals receive behavioral therapy â the zoo likes to give them choices about their activities to build their confidence. A lot goes into little decisions about their habitat, Herman says: should they be given smooth round logs to play on or unstable logs, so when they walk across it wiggles a little bit? A veterinary rehabilitation doctor helps figure out ways to rebuild their muscles. Some mountain lions are eventually able to return to the wild, but itâs unclear what the future holds for Hazel and Holly. In a few months, they will be transferred to the Big Bear Alpine zoo in the San Bernardino mountains of southern California to spend their days together. Eventually, Herman hopes to create a ârewildingâ program so some cubs can be nursed back to health and reintroduced in the wild â but thatâs not an option right now. Mountain lions are not critically endangered yet, but their population is in a decline that makes this time especially vital. She points to the need for more wildlife overpasses like the Wallis Annenberg, being built over the 101 freeway in northern Los Angeles county, as the main reason cubs come in without their mother is due to vehicle collisions. In Santa Cruz, the first highway underpass for wildlife was recently completed. âCoexistence is complicated but [itâs] so important to realize the time is now,â Herman says. âThis opportunity might disappear in a couple years.â",Guardian,18/02/2023,Charismatic cats: mountain lion besties gain TikTok following,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/18/hazel-holly-oakland-zoo-mountain-lion-cubs-tiktok

Smaller content creators, with less to lose, often initiate the trend. Despite potential risks to collaborations, the trend is expected to continue and reshape influencer marketing.


","More and more content creators on social media are rejecting traditional influencer culture and becoming âdeinfluencersâ instead, according to social media experts. Influencers have historically sold something to users. Whether that is the newest trending lipgloss or the viral âitâ dress, the products â often available at a discount using influencersâ special codes â are perceived to provide a certain lifestyle, one that is aesthetically pleasing and on trend. However, a different type of viral trend is taking over. Content creators are deinfluencing users, giving advice on which promoted products are not worth the hype or outright telling them what not to buy. Bita, or @bbybeets, 25, posted a video on TikTok listing items she could not be influenced into purchasing because theyâre âjust not affordableâ. In the video, which has had more than 58,000 views, Bita says people on an average salary cannot afford items such as Â£95 Ugg Tasman slippers and Apple AirPods Max headphones, which cost about Â£550, but they feel pressured to buy them to stay on trend. âAll the brands I mentioned charge hundreds of pounds per item,â she said. âTo purchase a lot of these trending items, youâd have to be on a certain income, and most people arenât and thatâs including me. âI personally love the brands I showed. Itâs more that Iâm reminding my audience itâs actually not normal to have those things. Itâs quite a privilege and a luxury.â On TikTok, the #deinfluencing hashtag has more than 159.6m views. The popularity of the trend is driven by timing and people becoming sick of being told they have to constantly buy something, according to Jago Sherman, head of strategy at the social media marketing agency Goat. âWeâve reached a point of critical mass when it comes to consumerism,â he said. âPeople are kind of fed up with going on social media and being told: âYou need this and thisâ, especially with the cost of living.â For Valeria Fridegotto, 22, a student and part-time content creator living in Chicago, Illinois, the economic climate prompted her to make a video about products she thinks are overrated. âWith the economic climate in the US, people are more careful with what they spend their money on,â she said. âI feel like theyâre naturally attracted to people who discourage them from buying really expensive items.â Fridegotto named Olaplex shampoo and conditioner, costing about $60 (Â£50) for the set, the Charlotte Tilbury Beauty Light Wand (Â£30) and the Dior Backstage Rosy Glow Blush (Â£31) as products that âdonât deserve the hypeâ they have been given by other content creators. Her video has had more than 1.3m views and hundreds of comments. The TikTok algorithm âcan be follower agnosticâ, so users with a relatively small amount of followers can go viral, which has fuelled the trend, Sherman said. âThe controversial statements are the ones that get more engagement because people comment,â he said. âA big influencer, unprompted, is less likely to start a trend that is âdeinfluencingâ. This trend would have been started by lots of small content creators and it has essentially trickled up to the bigger influencers, because smaller creators have less to lose by defaming products.â The success of deinfluencing feeds into the broader âeat the richâ narrative seen across the media in films like The Menu and TV shows like The White Lotus, said Paul Greenwood, head of research and insight at social media agency We Are Social. âWeâve seen a lot of creators take this money-saving expert approach,â he said. âTheyâll talk about the value of the product, whether you can get it cheaper anywhere else, whether you can buy different products that do the same thing. âThey know their audience better than anyone else so if they know their audience is feeling the pinch, theyâre going to react to that to try to stay on their side.â While some users in the comments below Fridegottoâs video shared her views about the products, she said she worries her openness might backfire in the future. âIn a perfect world, weâd like to think that brands would take it as feedback, but Iâm afraid that it might put potential collaboration in prejudice. âI will continue to let people know: âHey, I got this viral thingâ because there will continue to be viral products, but Iâll let them make their own decision,â she said. For Sherman, this trend is going nowhere. âMy perspective is that another word for it is an âhonestâ review. âThere have been some people who have said: âIs deinfluencing the end of influencing?â To which I say: âDeinfluencing is influencingâ â itâs the exact same thing,â he said. âI see no reason why six months down the line it wonât still be around.â",Guardian,15/02/2023,TikTok âdeinfluencersâ tap into trend for saving money,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/feb/15/tiktok-deinfluencers-trend-saving-money
62,"Sportsbet, an online gambling company, is targeting young women on TikTok with advertising to diversify its male-dominated customer base. While gambling promotions are banned on TikTok, Sportsbet gained permission for a controlled trial. Videos featured young women discussing novelty bets on Rihanna's Super Bowl halftime performance. The ads are age-restricted, monitored, and limited in frequency. Critics express concerns about regulatory oversight and the potential normalization of gambling among young women. Researchers note the industry's strategy of appealing to new demographics, similar to tobacco marketing tactics.","The online gambling company Sportsbet is using TikTok to target young women with advertising designed to diversify its predominately male client base, according to gambling researchers and marketing experts. Gambling promotions are banned on TikTok but late last year the Chinese-owned social media company agreed to allow Sportsbet to target Australian users as part of a strictly controlled trial. âA closed pilot for sports betting is currently in operation for one managed client who has obtained permission from TikTok via an application process,â states the companyâs advertising policy. Shortly before the US Super Bowl this week, Sportsbet published a video ad with a young woman drawing attention to ânovelty betâ markets on Rihannaâs half-time performance. The video ran the âgamble responsiblyâ tag in small print. âGirls group chat going wild because Rihanna is dropping Super Bowl half-time show teasers and Sportsbet has markets on it,â the video caption said as a young woman typed into her phone. The novelty markets allowed people to bet on what outfit Rihanna would wear, what props she would use, how long she would sing for and what colour liquid would be poured on the winning coach after the match. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Sportsbet has published other videos featuring the Sydney-based influencer Luisa Dal Din. One video ran the caption âme pretending I know horse racing to impress my crushâ. A spokesperson for TikTok said the ads were only shown to users 21 or older and were closely monitored. Their frequency was also restricted and users could opt out of seeing them. A Sportsbet spokesperson said the ads had been age-restricted to âminimise the risk of exposure to minors while connecting with adult audiences on the platforms they enjoyâ. Toby Ralph, an advertising expert, said Sportsbet was using the TikTok trial to maximise its client base and profits. âThis means finding new markets. [Young women] who couldnât give a shit about the merits of the Chiefs or the Eagles can be induced to pony up cash by connecting to a bet on Rihanna, and suggesting that the tribe they want to join is crazy for it,â Ralph said. âDoes this lead to ethical concerns? No. From an advertising perspective, if itâs legal, they will go all in.â The Alliance for Gambling Reform has expressed concern about regulatory oversight of the trial, despite TikTokâs insistence it is strictly controlled. Late last year the alliance complained about the ads to the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission, alleging a breach of the advertising rules. The complaint was dismissed. âAs Sportsbet is licensed by the Northern Territory gambling regulator, it is suggested that you lodge your complaint with the Northern Territory Racing Commission,â a VGCCC manager said in an email seen by Guardian Australia. An alliance spokesperson said the TikTok trial âopens the floodgatesâ to a demographic of Australians who have not always been exposed to gambling advertisements. âThe sponsored posts have been gender-targeted with young women being told they can now place bets on superficial things like BeReal times, Love Island and White Lotus season three,â an alliance spokesperson said. Dr Simone McCarthy, a gambling researcher at Deakin University, said young women were an untapped market for the gambling industry. âGambling is becoming normalised for women and a lot of this has to do with the marketing they see,â McCarthy said. âOur research shows that young women perceive that gambling advertising has begun to appeal to women and that women are increasingly featured in gambling advertising. âWe saw this with tobacco. When [companies] saturated the male market they started designing products that were appealing to women and this same strategy is now being used with novelty bets.â",Guardian,14/02/2023,"Sportsbet is targeting young women on TikTok to diversify male client base, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/14/sportsbet-is-targeting-young-women-on-tiktok-to-diversify-male-client-base-experts-say
63,"Hedi Slimane, the designer for Celine, created a disco-themed fashion show at Paris nightspot Le Palace. The event combined fashion, music, and youth subcultures, drawing in celebrities and club kids. Slimane's rock 'n' roll aesthetic was showcased with leather trousers, daring outfits, and nods to indie and electroclash music. The show celebrated special occasions and community, emphasizing the joy of going out and finding one's tribe. Slimane's approach has been successful for Celine, driving commercial performance and reaching a Û2bn turnover.","If itâs fashionable to be immersive, Hedi Slimane is Ã  la mode. His menswear show for Celine involved a takeover of the Paris nightspot Le Palace, where on the opening night back in 1978 Grace Jones had her clothes torn off by the plastered crowd and was covered by Yves Saint Laurent, on hand with a well-placed cummerbund. Downstairs, almost 50 years later, the place was still fabulous and bedecked with sequins. With a fashion show, gig and party, Slimaneâs mission â along with showing the clothes for autumn 2023 â was to create a disco to die for, a playground for the eraâs new club kids. And, of course, they came, clad in dramatic looks â for instance, the experimental musician Yves Tumour, who was resplendent in a blue wig, outrageously embellished black leather jacket and fishnet stockings. Meanwhile, the street outside was closed in anticipation of the arrival of Lisa from Blackpink, K-popâs biggest girl band. Slimaneâs talent is to create a parallel universe in which fashion, music and youth subcultures all come together to create a dazzling whole. On Friday night, first there was a fashion show, then a concert by the Irish band the Murder Capital and the Libertines, and then a party that stretched until 3am, populated by the club kids of Paris who were the nightâs real stars, and some celebrities ranging from Catherine Deneuve to Wiz Khalifa. At the beginning of the show, Pete Doherty caused some consternation by bringing his large dog with him to the front row, but sadly the many TikTokers in attendance were denied their viral moment when the mutt remained well-behaved and was finally led off by a dog handler. In this beguiling other world, Slimaneâs rockânâroll aesthetic reigned supreme. Since the pandemic, the designer has cocked a snook at the fashion week schedules, preferring either to show films instead of catwalk shows, or to stage huge extravaganzas that take in bands and a party. In December in Los Angeles, he staged a show that included performances by the Strokes and Iggy Pop and a runway that posited a return to skinny jeans â a trend that, as the designer of Dior Homme in the early 00s, he pretty much invented. And Slimaneâs instincts have proved lucrative, too â Celine has achieved the â¬2bn turnover that the LVMH boss, Bernard Arnault, set as a target when the Frenchman took over the house in 2018. Slimane had previously applied his rockânâroll aesthetic to Saint Laurent, a tenure that was controversial among some fashion critics but supercharged the labelâs commercial performance. At the Celine show, Slimane was at his most uncompromising. Dozens of pairs of leather trousers were marched down the catwalk, culminating in a shocking pink, diamante-studded two-piece that Khalifa told the Guardian he would be pleased to wear. Aside from that, in classic Slimane styling there was a fake-fur coat worn over a suit jacket, over a vest with a leopardskin scarf. Slimane has dressed rock stars for years, from David Bowie and Mick Jagger to Jack White of the White Stripes, who was also in attendance. If indie sleaze â the revival of the early 00sâ hedonistic looks â was a theme, Slimane was also nodding to electroclash, the early 00s club phenomenon that rebooted 80s synthpop and took its visual cues from Leigh Boweryâs legendary club Taboo. As well as in-your-face fashion, the show also honoured the community that Slimane has built up over more than two decades. Afterwards, the Libertines played, fronted by Doherty, Slimaneâs erstwhile muse when the singer was at the height of his indie rock fame, but who is now, happily, burly and middle-aged. The performance yielded the pleasing spectacle of Khalifa nodding along to the lyrics âthey all get them out for the boys in the bandâ. Slimane has remained unshakeable in his enthusiasm for indie music, despite the fact that in the internet era it has faded as an avatar of youthful rebellion. Nevertheless, the young Parisians in the audience lapped it up, underlining the fact that the whole evening was ultimately a celebration of the simple joy of going out. At its root, Slimaneâs Celine is about the pleasure of special occasions. He is instinctively aware of the meaning of clothes â the frock you wear for your birthday, the shoes that make you feel as if you can take on the world. Displaying such an extreme iteration of this idea â even the tracksuit tops were styled with leather trousers â Slimane paid tribute to the youth of Paris. But ultimately the show was about community in the internet age, the power of togetherness and of finding your impeccably dressed tribe.",Guardian,12/02/2023,Hedi Slimaneâs Celine show revives early 00s hedonism for TikTok age,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/feb/12/hedi-slimane-celine-show-revives-early-00s-hedonism-for-tiktok-age
64,"The debate over TikTok's security risks and data privacy continues to escalate. The app faces accusations of providing user data to the Chinese government and potentially influencing users in alignment with Chinese foreign policy. While evidence supporting these claims is lacking, concerns persist. Western governments, including the US and several European countries, have taken measures to restrict TikTok's use. TikTok has made efforts to address these concerns, such as establishing data centers in the US and Europe. The controversy surrounding TikTok highlights the need for broader data privacy legislation.


","The FBI has called it a national security threat. The US government has passed a law forcing officials to delete it from their phones. Texas senator Ted Cruz has denounced it as âa Trojan horse the Chinese Communist party can use to influence what Americans see, hear, and ultimately thinkâ. And in March its CEO will defend its existence before the US Congress. For those unaware of the debate broiling on the other side of the Atlantic, the target of this strong rhetoric might prove surprising: an app best known for viral dances, launching generation Z media stars, and sucking teens down an hours-long content abyss. But the rancorous debate over TikTok that began under the Trump administration has rolled on under President Biden. In addition to a ban of the app on all federal government devices, at least 27 states have blocked TikTok on devices theyâve issued, affecting a number of state schools and universities, too. A bipartisan bill, introduced in Congress last December, stipulates banning the appâs use by everyone in the United States. TikTok scepticism is spreading to Europe too. Some politicians â echoing their Washington-based counterparts â contend that TikTok poses a security risk, warning it could potentially hand user data to Chinese authorities, and/or be wielded as a propaganda tool for the Chinese government â subtly influencing TikTokâs more than 1 billion monthly active users in a direction that dovetails with Chinese foreign policy goals. Itâs emblematic of ratcheting Sino-western tensions, where tussling over technology is as much about genuine paranoia over espionage as it is a useful arena for geopolitical grandstanding. In the age of the âsplinternetâ â which has seen the once-open web fracturing across different jurisdictions â anxieties over data sovereignty and information flows are on the rise. How western governments respond to TikTok could mark a decisive step in how technology is regulated in the decades to come. While accusations that TikTok hands over user data to the Chinese government are so far unsubstantiated, the appâs claims over its trustworthiness took a blow in December with the revelation that employees at ByteDance (TikTokâs parent company) accessed TikTok data in an attempt to track the whereabouts of several western journalists in order to discover their sources within the company. TikTok says the incident involved improper data access and that the employees responsible have been fired, but the transgression has nevertheless served as a lightning rod for apprehensions surrounding the company and the appâs data privacy protocols. Alicia Kearns MP, the Conservative chair of both the Foreign Affairs Select Committee and of the China Research Group, has previously called upon TikTok to provide testimony about the data privacy of UK users. âIn their evidence, they said something like âThis could never happenâ,â says Kearns. âWell, obviously that is not true, and it has happened.â (Last October, ByteDance tweeted that âTikTok has never been used to âtargetâ any members of the US government, activists, public figures or journalists.â) TikTok met European commissioners last month to discuss data privacy and content moderation, in the context of how the company plans to comply with the EUâs new digital services regulation. âTheyâre starting to realise that TikTok is not just another app to communicate, or send videos to one another, or for amusement,â says Belgian MEP Tom Vandendriessche. âTikTok is gathering the data of our citizens.â Itâs worth noting TikTok is not the only company that has engaged in this practice: American businesses, including Microsoft and Uber, have also been found guilty of tracking individual users through their products in the past. But in the US, the news arrived at a highly sensitive time for the company. âThis should be the final nail in the coffin for the idea that the US can trust TikTok,â tweeted Brendan Carr, a member of the US Federal Communications Commission. *** The conversation in Europe is a little different. So far, the bloc has been less willing to single out TikTok on the basis of the location of its parent company. It is scrutinising the app over data privacy concerns: Irelandâs data protection commissioner opened two probes into the company in 2021 â one focusing on its handling of childrenâs data, the other to check that its data transfers to China complied with EU data legislation. (A draft decision has been submitted on the first inquiry.) However, this is not unique to TikTok. The likes of Facebook and Google have also become ensnared in Europeâs data privacy laws, and the EU is currently wrangling with the US over whether EU data should be allowed to be sent there, for fears it could be hoovered up by US intelligence agencies. âWhile some questions about TikTok and our Chinese heritage have become politicised, we take national security concerns very seriously,â says Theo Bertram, vice-president of public policy and government relations, Europe at TikTok. Regardless of where you are, how seriously should you take the warnings? Some technology experts say the accusations are somewhat overblown. Both the data privacy and content manipulation threats cited by politicians currently lack convincing evidence, says Graham Webster, research scholar and editor in chief of the DigiChina Project at the Stanford University Cyber Policy Center in California. âI think both of these theories are possible, but at this point they both require a significant amount of imagination to actually constitute a US national security threat,â says Webster. He doesnât think itâs unreasonable at this stage to think that Chinese officials might have unauthorised access to TikTok user data. âBut you would have to make an argument for why that access can be used in such a way that constitutes a national security threat,â he says. This is because the data held by TikTok isnât unique. The app can collect location data, but must ask users before tracking detailed GPS data. If the user declines, only their rough whereabouts can be gathered. (In fact, a TikTok spokesperson claims its employees didnât succeed in the attempted tracking of journalists precisely for this reason.) Whatâs more, the same data is gathered by any number of apps â and is routinely sold on to third-party data brokers who make it available to prospective buyers. âThere are lots of ways that foreign governments can access data in the United States,â says Anupam Chander, professor of law and technology at Georgetown University Law Center, Washington DC. âTikTok seems to be an unlikely target of data gathering by the Chinese government, because of the largely public nature of the activity on the app.â *** Data privacy issues aside, what about the âTrojan horseâ argument advanced by the likes of Cruz? Is TikTok secretly inculcating in generation Z a taste for Chinese Communist party talking points? In 2019 the Guardian revealed that the appâs content guidelines for moderators on how to deal with inflammatory content yielded the serendipitous by-product of stifling any mention of Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or Falun Gong â all topics that are suppressed by Beijing. At the time, the company insisted the documents didnât reflect its current policy and that it had since embraced a localised content moderation strategy tailored to each region. A 2021/22 study by Natoâs Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence found that TikTok compared favourably to other platforms on combating inauthentic manipulation (coming second to Twitter, and ahead of Facebook, Instagram and YouTube). The report recommended more cooperation with external researchers to make it easier to study content moderation on the platform, something a TikTok spokesperson says the app is aiming to grow. Although TikTok has repeatedly said that western user data is not stored in China, that it has never, and would never, share user data with Chinese officials, and that its global content moderation strategy is not beholden to Beijing, over the past six years, TikTok and Washingtonâs committee on foreign investment in the United States (CFIUS) have been negotiating a deal aimed at finally allaying the concerns of US politicians. The $1.5bn Project Texas involves the establishment of a data centre that will store US user data in Texas, under the watchful eye of Oracle, the American software giant headed up by billionaire GOP funder and Trump ally Larry Ellison. To address fears about content manipulation that serves the Chinese government, Oracle will also inspect the appâs source code and content algorithms. TikTok is now making similar arrangements for Europe. The company is setting up a data centre in Ireland that will store the data of users in the UK and EU. These measures would place the appâs data practices under far more scrutiny than its Silicon Valley competitors, according to Webster. âBased on the reporting of what [Project Texas] would look like,â he says, âit sounds like theyâre talking about measures that should basically mitigate these potential security threats â as much as is reasonable, in my opinion.â Whether it will be enough to satisfy regulators is another issue. One party eyeing the negotiations with interest is Facebook, which views TikTok as an existential threat. Last year, the Washington Post revealed a Facebook-backed lobbying campaign targeting TikTok that specifically played on data privacy fears. This could prove money well spent, given that TikTok users say in the event of the app being banned they would probably pivot to (the Facebook-owned) Instagram or other social media apps. More bans raise the prospect of legal challenges on the basis of freedom of speech or expression. The obvious parallels between banning apps and the Chinese governmentâs strict internet controls have been widely noted â a phenomenon thatâs particularly ironic for Republicans, who have spent the past few years pounding the drum for supposed freedom of speech. But there is agreement on one thing â that this should serve as a catalyst for the US to finally start thinking about data privacy more generally. âThe idea of foreign ownership as being the critical basis for intervention [on TikTok] seems unwise,â says Chander. âWe should have a broader approach that examines the national security risks posed by data flows more generally.â Heâs not alone in hoping the TikTok debate might spur progress on the establishment of national data privacy legislation that would protect American consumers on all apps, not just TikTok.",Guardian,5/02/2023,TikTok: how the west has turned on gen Zâs favourite app,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/05/tiktok-how-west-turned-on-gen-z-favourite-app
65,"TikTok has conducted a test in Australia that resulted in the sound being removed from many users' videos. The test aimed to analyze music usage on the platform, but it affected not only background music but also entire audio tracks, including educational and news content. The lack of warning or communication from TikTok has caused frustration among creators, potentially impacting their livelihoods. The test may push some creators to switch to other platforms, jeopardizing TikTok's relationship with the music industry. TikTok has apologized and plans to restore full access after the test period.


","A month-long test by social media platform TikTok has resulted in many of its Australian users having the sound removed from their videos, rendering them unwatchable. According to a spokesperson for TikTok, it has been testing in Australia to analyse how music is accessed and used on the platform. âWhile the test is under way, we expect that some of our users will not be able to access our full music and sounds library. For more than half of our community there will be no change to their experience and the test will not impact them,â a spokesperson for the platform said. However, rather than just the background music being removed, entire audio tracks have been muted, including those used in videos for educational and news content. For Mary McGillivray, a large Australian creator who makes art history content, this has meant approximately 57% of her back catalogue has been rendered unwatchable for a significant portion of her audience. âItâs really confusing, because for a lot of my content I upload my own audio tracks, where Iâve paid for a licence from an external provider, so these arenât even TikTok sounds â¦ theyâve been flagged as violating TikTokâs community guidelines, but there isnât even a place for me to respond to the âviolationâ and provide my music licence,â McGillivray said. She said this has been particularly stressful given that neither the creators or users received any warning from TikTok indicating the existence of the test or their participation in it. McGillivrayâs only source of information has been through other, larger creators, with a direct line to workers at the company. âItâs very disappointing,â McGillivray said. âCreators are not guinea pigs, weâre the people who provide the content and therefore the entire value of a platform â¦ it does make you feel like itâs a platform that doesnât value its creators as much as it should.â ABC News and Guardian Australia have also had sound removed on a number of TikTok videos. McGillivray said it was luck she had alternative revenue streams, but other big name creators have told Guardian Australia that the test poses a serious threat to their livelihoods this month, with scheduled brand collaborations now at risk. The alienation of these users comes at a tricky time for the platform. The Guardian understands a number of large TikTokers have been approached by other short-form video platforms and offered lucrative deals for exclusive content. Some have now said this test may be the âfinal strawâ and they will make the switch. TikTok has developed a symbiotic relationship with the music industry in recent years â with the use of popular songs in videos becoming an integral part of the appâs appeal, and in turn a trackâs ability to go viral on TikTok influencing its success. Reports published by Bloomberg suggest TikTok has been engaged in lengthy negotiations with various large record labels over the share of ad revenue they receive in turn for allowing the use of their tracks on the app. The Australian test is being viewed by some as an attempt by TikTok to see if usage remains steady despite limited access to music, thus strengthening their parent company, ByteDanceâs, bargaining position. The company has now set up a feedback form for affected creators. In a public statement TikTok apologised for any âdisappointmentâ caused, stating it looked âforward to restoring the full catalogue at the conclusion of the test period.â",Guardian,3/02/2023,Australian TikTok creators could dump app after month-long test removed sound from videos,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/03/australian-tiktok-creators-could-dump-app-after-month-long-test-removed-sound-from-videos
66,"The practice of secretly recording and exposing men's unwanted attention towards women at the gym has become a trend on TikTok. Videos under the hashtag ""gym weirdos"" show instances of men attempting to flirt or bother women during their workouts. Studies indicate that a significant percentage of women feel uncomfortable and experience harassment while exercising in public. While some dismiss these complaints, others, including male trainer Joey Swoll, acknowledge the issue and advocate for proper gym etiquette. Gym spaces have historically been gendered, and the rise of women weightlifting has led to more instances of unwanted advances.","Women have long been hyper-vigilant about unwanted male attention at the gym. But before smartphones, the sense they were being stared at was more of a feeling than a certainty. Now catching perceived offenders in action has become its own sport on TikTok, with women covertly leaving their phones on record and then watching the resulting video to see who was staring at their behind while they were doing squats. On the app, the pitiless hashtag âgym weirdosâ has over 1.9m views, with videos showing men attempting to flirt with or pick up women who just want to get through their sets unbothered. Gina Love is one such TikTok detective. She goes to the gym at least four times a week, because the endorphin boost that comes from a good deadlift counteracts the daily stress of life. âWatch this creep come over to my personal bubble while doing [Romanian deadlifts],â Love wrote in the caption of an encounter she posted on TikTok, which was liked over 50,000 times. âThe gym was practically empty, and so many corners to be in and he chose this one.â In the clip, the man stands directly behind Love as she lifts dumbbells before deciding to leave. âI would say I experience creeps 15% of the times I work out,â Love, who is 29 and lives in Atlanta, told the Guardian. This usually manifests as a man staring at her for an âuncomfortably longâ amount of time. âItâs almost like theyâre trying to undress you in their heads,â Love said. Some might say inappropriate looks or creepy comments are as much of a feature in the gym for women as broken workout equipment or crowds. One study from 2021 found that 76% of women feel uncomfortable exercising in public due to harassment. In another survey from Run Repeat, 56% of women reported facing harassment during their workouts. Love sometimes leaves the gym when the staring is too much. âIt makes me feel disgusted, anxious and my survival instinct kicks in,â she said. âIâll typically cut my workout short because I canât get back into feeling comfortable with that person around me.â Love swaps stories with friends: one recently told her that a man had tried to secretly record her during a workout. Comments on her videos, and others posted by women with similar experiences, elicit different reactions. Some commenters agree that gyms feel like predatory spaces. But others dismiss the womenâs complaints as overreactions. âItâs not your personal space,â one person wrote in reply to Loveâs clip. âWTF is a personal bubble at a public gym?â another asked. Joey Swoll is a male trainer and TikToker who calls himself the âCEO of gym positivityâ. He frequently reposts these videos with commentary on gym etiquette, either exonerating the so-called âcreepâ or validating the frazzled womanâs feelings to his 6 million TikTok followers. Last month, an influencer named Jessica Fernandez posted a video from the gym showing a man glancing in her direction as she worked out. âI hate this, I hate when thereâs weirdos,â she said under her breath in the clip. âFeral, feral, feral, like fucking feral.â The man then asked her if she needed help with a weight, and she declined. Swoll responded to her video, writing: âWomen are harassed in gyms and it needs to stop, but you are not one of them. An act of kindness or a glance does not make you a victim.â The video was liked over 812,000 times, and Fernandez ultimately apologized for her post. Swoll and Fernandez did not respond to requests for comment. Why canât men mind their own business at the gym? Natalia Mehlman Petrzela, a historian and author of the new book Fit Nation: The Gains and Pains of Americaâs Exercise Obsession, said that gyms had long been gendered spaces. Historically, separate menâs and womenâs gyms existed, or health clubs hosted intentional âladiesâ daysâ. âWhen I hear about men ogling or hitting on women at the gym, I am often reminded of how for decades, women exercising was considered a kind of sexy spectacle,â Petrzela said. In June of 1972, for instance, New York held its first Mini-Marathon, which was televised and hosted by the hosiery brand Lâeggs. Playboy Bunnies flanked the starting line of the race. âItâs clear from the footage that some of the male spectators were there to leer at, rather than cheer on, the womenâs athletes,â Petrzela said. Even as second-wave feminism of the 1970s and 80s encouraged women to sign up for workout classes en masse, late-night hosts constantly joked about watching Spandex-clad personalities like Debbie Drake or Jane Fonda gyrate on TV for something âother than the exerciseâ. In the 1980s, after co-ed gyms became the norm, columnists wrote articles about how gyms were âthe new singles barsâ, a concept that powered the 1985 romantic comedy Perfect, starring John Travolta as a reporter who falls for a perpetually sweating health coach, played by Jamie Lee Curtis. The majority of todayâs gyms are co-ed, and the idea of going back to women-only workout spaces remains controversial. Last year, Connecticutâs supreme court ruled that these areas violated a state law banning discrimination based on gender. Despite this, certain sections of the gym tend to be unofficially sex-segregated. âWomen are overrepresented in the studios and on cardio equipment while men disproportionately flock to the weight floor,â Petrzela said. âBut the boom in popularity of women weightlifting, and thus being more present in a part of the gym that has traditionally been more male, means that there are probably more instances of those unwanted advances.â This means that women like Love, who find so much joy in working out, have to negotiate with their sense of safety any time they want to head to the gym. âThis behavior from men encourages me to work out at the earliest time possible, typically when the gym opens,â she said. âI tend to go with a friend because creeps are more timid when there are two girls together. I try to keep my clothing incognito: oversized hoodie and a hat. Itâs sad that girls canât be comfortable wearing whatever they please to work out without being harassed.â",Guardian,2/02/2023,âWatch this creepâ: the women exposing gym harassment on TikTok,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/01/gym-weirdos-tiktok-videos-women-recording-sexual-harassment
67,"The author discusses the trend of styling homes like celebrities' luxurious showrooms and the allure of house porn on social media. They explore the concept of a ""non-aesthetic home"" as a counter to this trend, where TikTok users share videos of messy, lived-in spaces. The author experiments with living in a non-aesthetic home but quickly finds themselves overwhelmed by the mess and unable to let go of their neurotic tendencies. Eventually, they give in and start cleaning again.","You have seen the videos: the celebrities trotting through their squillion-dollar manors on camera, beckoning towards the signifiers of their (and their underpaid assistantsâ) impeccable, lavish taste. If you scrunch your eyes enough, you can picture yourself living there too: among Troye Sivanâs stupidly chic tchotchkes; in Dakota Johnsonâs entirely green kitchen; alongside Kylie Jennerâs inexplicable, outsize James Turrell sculpture. Because I am a writer, my only hope is to marry rich. But that has not stopped me from trying â to the distress of many housemates â to style my hovel like these palatial showrooms, on the off-chance that I become suddenly famous and Architectural Digest decides to email me. I spend my days endlessly fussing and rearranging homewares. I like to think of myself as a Marketplace maven, except for the times I wimp out of a tough negotiation and end up getting scammed by a side table seller (actually this is every time). I tell any and all houseguests that turning on overhead lighting is like killing my firstborn. Well, no, that one is a lie. Overhead lighting would be worse. Call it mass delusion, but I am far from alone. House porn, while hardly a new phenomenon, has made victims of us all over the last three years, sucking us into its fastidiously styled vortex as we languished at home; just look at the deluge of Instagram accounts hawking midcentury goods and bubbly glassware. Buying trend pieces like checkerboard rugs, tiled tables and mushroom lamps makes us feel celebrity-adjacent â like we, too, have a design agency on speed dial and more than $5 to our name. (I am embarrassed to say I own two-thirds of these items.) Yes, overconsumption is bad. Yes, screw fast furniture, algorithmic tastes, egregious displays of wealth, etc etc. But no amount of protest can dim the tiny, monkey part of my brain that lights up when I place a candle into an absurdly shaped holder at just the right angle.

Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning But another form of therapy is spreading on TikTok as an antidote to this trend. Itâs a call to arms for the ânon-aesthetic homeâ â a hashtag with close to nine million views and counting. Users share videos of broken cabinetry, toys strewn across the floor, sauce stains on walls and doors. You get the point â which is that, like everything on social media, real life doesnât (and neednât) resemble the interiors we see online. âReminder,â one popular video goes. âItâs okay to have a non-aesthetic, visibly lived-in home.â When I encounter this video in my feed, I groan like a petulant child. Also like a petulant child, I eventually acquiesce: would forcing myself to live in a ânon-aesthetic homeâ make my life â¦ better? I set some ground rules for my new, supposedly unencumbered existence: no cleaning up crumbs, no dish-washing, no furniture fussing, no tidying up of any kind unless absolutely necessary â so basically what it feels like to be a straight man. Within 10 minutes, there are flecks of toast on the dining table and I can feel myself heading into withdrawal. A vein is throbbing in my temple. My hand clenches; the involuntary urge to reach for a dish cloth surges through me. Maybe, I say to my housemate â who has graciously allowed me to sully our home for 48 hours â just maybe, I will come out of this a more relaxed person. She immediately laughs. By the end of the day, I am longing for death: sweet release from this nightmare specifically designed to inflict pain on me. There are glasses stacked on the counter, a tea towel crumpled somewhere, a coffee brewer left abandoned in the sink, a rice cooker open like a gaping maw on the bench. I accidentally knock a chair an inch to the left and am not allowed to reset it. âArggghhhhhhhh!â I scream into the void and an extremely untidy void screams back. My partner comes over and does not notice the whirlwind that has beset the space, because â fine â objectively the space does not look so different, only slightly more ruffled. But I am not objective. I am obdurate and neurotic, and all I can see is clutter (which probably means I shouldnât have ghosted my therapist). âWhat if Architectural Digest walks in RIGHT NOW??â I moan. My pleas go unheard. We are more than halfway through the experiment. The house is now well and truly ânon-aestheticâ, unless that aesthetic is âfood fightâ. I now understand why my parents loved mopping so much. With hours to go, I leave the house for temporary reprieve â so blissfully unaware of whatâs to come. I am prone to exaggeration, but I promise this next part is the unadorned truth: I return home to find the dryer completely unhooked from the wall after a particularly vigorous cycle, hanging precariously from a single hinge, all of its contents emptied onto the floor still sopping.

68,"The author discusses the use of coded language and emojis on social media platforms like TikTok to avoid censorship or shadow-banning. They mention an incident involving Julia Fox, who misunderstood the meaning of ""mascara"" in a TikTok comment and faced backlash. The author highlights the challenges of navigating online communication and suggests that the only sure way to avoid controversy is to stay off the internet.


","OK, quick: define âmascaraâ. If you answered âa substance you apply with a wand to your eyelashesâ or something along those lines, then congratulations â you are officially not a young person on TikTok. If you run in those circles, however, then âmascaraâ is code for a variety of things ranging from a vibrator to a penis to a romantic partner. Julia Fox, the Uncut Gems actor, came to this eye-opening revelation in an extremely awkward way last week. She made a jokey comment on a viral TikTok video in which someone talked about their âmascaraâ being stolen and was promptly accused of making light of sexual assault. After a frankly ridiculous backlash, Fox apologised and explained that she thought the person was talking about âmascara like as in makeupâ. Which, if you are not very young (Fox turns 33 on Thursday) and not extremely online, is a perfectly natural thing to think. âMascaraâ is far from the only code word being used on social media. There are well-founded concerns that posting about âcontroversialâ or explicit subjects might get your account âshadow-bannedâ, meaning the platform artificially limits your reach. To avoid this happening, users have started getting creative. People will talk about having âseggsâ, for example, or use âaccountantâ as a stand-in for sex worker. Anti-vaxxers on Instagram apparently refer to vaccinated people as âswimmersâ. My personal favourite? âLe dollar beanâ is code for lesbian (itâs how TikTokâs text-to-speech feature pronounces âle$bianâ). Emojis are also deployed artfully: the corn emoji (ð½) is a censor-friendly way to talk about pornography. This modern-day cockney rhyming slang has been termed âalgospeakâ, because you are gaming the algorithm. Perhaps Foxâs faux pas has put the fear of God into you (as it has me). Perhaps you are wondering if the next time you make an innocent gag on a TikTok about sausage rolls you will be accused of genocide denial. I wish I had failsafe advice on how to avoid this fate.

TikTok denies allegations of Chinese Communist party access to user data and hopes to address concerns before Congress. The White House has not commented on supporting a legislative ban or the ongoing security review.","As the US legislative battle over TikTok continues to escalate, Shou Zi Chew, the chief executive of the video-sharing app, will make his first appearance before Congress to testify next month. Chew will testify before the House energy and commerce committee on 23 March, Republican representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers confirmed in a statement on Monday, as scrutiny of the Chinese-owned app over data privacy concerns grows. The news comes after the app was banned on government devices and school campuses in a number of states in recent months, as well as on federal devices after a ban was passed in Congress in December. Next month the House foreign affairs committee plans to hold a vote on a bill aimed at blocking the use of TikTok entirely in the US. âByteDance-owned TikTok has knowingly allowed the ability for the Chinese Communist party to access American user data,â McMorris Rodgers said, adding that Americans deserve to know how these actions affect their privacy and data security. TikTok has denied these claims, stating: âThe Chinese Communist party has neither direct nor indirect control of ByteDance or TikTok,â according to a company spokesman. It confirmed on Monday that Chew will testify. âWe welcome the opportunity to set the record straight about TikTok, ByteDance and the commitments we are making to address concerns about US national security before the House committee on energy and commerce,â the spokesman said, adding the company hopes âby sharing details of our comprehensive plans with the full committee, Congress can take a more deliberative approach to the issues at handâ. McMorris Rodgers and other Republican lawmakers have demanded more information from TikTok regarding the appâs impact on young people, concerns about harmful content and details on potential sexual exploitation of minors on the platform. TikTok was first targeted in earnest by the Trump administration in 2020, with a sweeping executive order prohibiting US companies from doing business with ByteDance, TikTokâs parent company. In the three years since, the company has sought to assure Washington that the personal data of US citizens cannot be accessed and its content cannot be manipulated by Chinaâs Communist party or anyone else under Beijingâs influence. While Biden revoked the Trump administration ban in June 2021, the reversal was made with a stipulation that the US committee on foreign investment (CFIUS) conduct a security review of the platform and suggested a path forward to avoid a permanent ban. That review has been ongoing as the CFIUS and TikTok have been in talks for more than two years aiming to reach a national security agreement to protect the data of US TikTok users.

How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book!â wrote Jane Austen in Pride and Prejudice. This weekend, 210 years after the publication of the second of her six novels, Austenâs work is providing as much enjoyment as ever â and to a younger audience than the author probably ever dreamed of. âWe have seen an increasing number of young Janeites visiting,â said Alice Hodges, who works at the Jane Austen Centre in Bath. These include children as young as eight. As well as screen adaptations and young adult fiction reimaginings of Austen and her novels, interest is being driven by a proliferation of internet memes and TikToks. These have spawned so many videos, images and hashtags online that it prompted a recent study led by a Cambridge academic entitled OMG Jane Austen. One of its authors has suggested Austen is the most memed writer after Shakespeare. The Bath museum features actor guides who play characters from the books, something that goes down well with younger visitors, says Hodges. It also offers the chance to try on costumes and write with quills. Eleven-year-old Clem Melling, who lives near Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, will be visiting the centre in June for her next birthday. âJane Austenâs writing is so energetic and fun, I love how witty, funny and clever she is,â she says. âThe focus on friendships and relationships means that you arenât concentrating on historical details all the time. The way she makes funny, sarcastic comments about her characters makes it feel as though sheâs talking to you like a friend.â Clemâs sister, Gillie, 10, is also a Janeite. Her favourite character is Eleanor Tilney from Northanger Abbey âbecause sheâs very calm and more relatable to modern girls, especially an introverted girl like meâ. Their mum, Hazel Davis, 46, a writer, welcomes her daughtersâ interest in Austen. She says: âI am a bit tired of books for children and young adults that are dystopian or apocalyptic. Itâs nice to read books with the girls that address human concerns but without angst. âThereâs no dumbing down with Austen. Sheâs smart, funny and insightful, and itâs so lovely that they relate to her writing so much. Itâs also a great, fun way to teach history â and especially feminist history. Many of her role models are intelligent and sparky women fighting to change their circumstances.â Julia Golding runs an Austen-inspired podcast, What Would Jane Do?, and is the author of the Jane Austen Investigates series of books, which reimagine the author as a child detective. She, too, has noticed a lot of younger readers coming to the work of the writer, who died in 1817. âIt may seem unlikely at first â what does this generation with all their social media options and frenetic visual culture find in Austen?â says Golding. âThen you realise thatâs the answer. Jane Austen allows everyone to step aside and take a breath in the beautiful worlds she creates. Then we see that we share more with the past than we imagined.â Even in a world where young girlsâ role models seem to be found on Love Island, Instagram and TikTok, there is a space for Austen, says Golding. âHer works are strangely applicable to our online existence. In the smaller worlds of her novel â a village, a great house â everyone is under a microscope, just as young people are with their connectivity,â she says. âJane Austen mightâve worn a bonnet and muslin but you feel, reading her, that she wouldâve been an amazing best friend for us now and help us get out of trouble.â Younger readers often come to Austen through reimaginings such as Goldingâs books, or film adaptations. Olive Jenkins, 16, who lives near Esher, Surrey, discovered her four years ago when she saw the 2005 film of Pride &amp; Prejudice on Netflix. âFrom then, I felt a connection to how true the love presented in this story was, despite complications that make the plot interesting,â says the A-level student, who went on to read the book after seeing the film. âI felt that, despite the tricky language, she imparts a very clear and euphoric idea of love, which is a sense that I only ever get when reading classical literature.â Dr Rita J Dashwood, who specialises in 18th- and 19th-century studies at the University of Liverpool, has researched how media riffing off Austenâs work has affected the authorâs legacy and brought new readers to the source material. âThe number of recent young adult novels that reimagine Austenâs works â particularly her most popular one, Pride and Prejudice â such as Ibi Zoboiâs Pride (2018) and Alice Osemanâs Solitaire (2014), as well as new media series such as The Lizzie Bennet Diaries (2012) for YouTube, make Austenâs novels accessible to young people in new and engaging ways,â she says. âMy experience as a university lecturer is also that, by the time students come to university, they have admired Austen for years, having encountered her both through the original novels and popular culture adaptations of her work.â",Guardian,29/01/2023,OMG!

71,"Several college campuses in the US have banned TikTok on their Wi-Fi networks, leading students to express frustration on the platform. These bans are part of a larger battle over data privacy concerns and Chinese influence on TikTok. State and federal lawmakers have imposed bans, while schools can block certain websites and apps on campus networks. However, experts suggest these bans are easily circumvented, and critics argue that they are politically motivated and ineffective. Calls for broader efforts to address data privacy issues on all social media platforms have been made.","The US battle with TikTok over data privacy concerns and Chinese influence has been heating up for years, and recent measures have brought college campuses to the forefront - with a number of schools banning the app entirely on campus wifi. Students have responded, of course, on TikTok. Taking advantage of viral sounds, they have expressed outrage at their favourite app being blocked at universities like Auburn, Oklahoma and Texas A&amp;M in the past few months. âDo they not realize people in college are actually adults?â one user wrote. âWe should make our own independent decision to use TikTok or not,â another said. But how did we get here? The actions come amid a cascade of TikTok bans by state and federal lawmakers in the US, who say the appâs China-based parent company, ByteDance, could collect sensitive user data and censor content that goes against the demands of the Chinese Communist party. TikTok was first targeted in earnest by the Trump administration in 2020, with a sweeping executive order prohibiting US companies from doing business with ByteDance. That measure was later revoked by Joe Biden in June 2021, but the companyâs problems were far from over. The current president stipulated that the US committee on foreign investment (CFIUS) conduct a security review of the platform and suggested a path forward to avoid a permanent ban. That review is ongoing, with no timeline released for a final decision. Meanwhile, states have taken action of their own, with Congress passing a ban of TikTok on all federal devices in December and 31 individual states banning the app on government devices, most of which were passed in the last two months. Most of the campus bans have been carried out in states that have already passed their own rules against the app, but questions remain about how impactful such measures will be. How does banning TikTok work? Schools often block or regulate traffic to certain websites on campus wifi networks, including harmful content and pornography and such measures can extend to specific apps. Similar measures have been taken in the past like with controversial anonymous social media platform Yik Yak. But tech experts say these bans are quite easy to circumvent, as the app will only be banned on shared campus wifi and not on individual devices. To bypass the block, students can simply turn off wifi and use personal cellular data, as one expert told me in my story on the topic this week. âThis specific ban will likely count as barely an inconvenience for the students subject to it, and it would be incredibly difficult, if not impossible, both technically and ethically, to enforce students using TikTok on their own personal devices,â said Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at cybersecurity firm Vulcan Cyber. An increased number of students exclusively using data rather than wifi could cause additional issues, like data networks being clogged on campuses, making student devices run more slowly and ineffectively. âThis is an extension of the clumsy and extreme state actions we have seen taken against TikTok at state levels,â said Angelo Carusone, president of the non-profit media watchdog Media Matters for America. âThe ban will be ineffective and does nothing except score political points and tax already flimsy infrastructure.â âA red herringâ? Many internet freedom advocates have questioned the policies, saying they amount to censorship and are largely ploys for influence at a time when targeting Chinese technology is politically beneficial. Others say such actions will only ramp up in coming months as election season approaches and politicians try to outdo each other with new measures. âItâs fertile ground, but TikTok is a red herring because such security concerns exist with all platforms,â Carusone said. âIt ends up being a hyper-political issue that does not respond to actual threats.â Meanwhile, many who oppose such measures have called for a broader effort to address some of the issues raised by TikTokâs recent legal battles, including the need for a national data privacy law, mandating data transparency, and encrypting messaging on social platforms. âThese problems exist on every social media app out there, not just TikTok,â said Gillian Diebold of the Center for Data Innovation.

72,"Several US college campuses, including Auburn University, University of Oklahoma, and Texas A&M, have banned TikTok on their Wi-Fi networks due to data privacy concerns. These bans are seen as an extension of actions taken by state and federal lawmakers against TikTok, citing potential data collection and censorship by its parent company, ByteDance. Critics argue that such bans are ineffective and politically motivated. Students can easily bypass the bans by using cellular data, and some experts suggest addressing broader data privacy issues across social media platforms instead.","Thereâs a new frontline opening up in the US war on TikTok: college campuses. The China-based app has already been banned on all federal government devices and on government devices in 31 states over data privacy concerns. Now restrictions are spreading to universities, with the Auburn University, University of Oklahoma, Texas A&amp;M and others all blocking the platform from school wifi networks in recent weeks. Such bans are possible because school policies allow for the blocking of traffic to certain websites on campus wifi networks, measures that are typically reserved for harmful content and pornography. But those policies can also extend to specific apps, which has been done in the past with platforms like anonymous social media account Yik Yak. Students at schools impacted by the bans have already taken to TikTok to complain, using popular memes and viral sounds to speak out. âThis regime is ridiculous,â one user wrote. Others seem to be testing the limits of such policies: âIâm not allowed to post TikToks anymore, so letâs see if I can,â another user said. âDo you guys see this video?â (The policies only prevent access to TikTok on school networks and do not prevent posting to the app using cellular data.) Some internet freedom advocates are also questioning the policies, calling them a misguided form of censorship. And others say such bans amount to pandering at a time when targeting Chinese technology is politically beneficial. âThis is an extension of the clumsy and extreme state actions we have seen taken against TikTok at state levels,â said Angelo Carusone, president of the non-profit media watchdog Media Matters for America. âThe ban will be ineffective and does nothing except score political points and tax already flimsy infrastructure.â The university bans come amid a cascade of actions against TikTok in recent months by lawmakers who say its China-based parent company could collect sensitive user data and censor content that goes against the demands of the Chinese Communist party. In late December, Congress passed a measure banning the platform on all federal government devices and similar bans have taken hold in more than 30 states in the past year, including Maryland and Georgia. Many internet freedom advocates have highlighted the irony of states and schools purportedly combatting Chinese censorship by censoring these apps themselves. âIf it werenât so alarming, it would be hilarious that US policy makers are trying to âbe tough on Chinaâ by acting exactly like the Chinese government,â said Evan Greer, deputy director of non-profit advocacy group Fight for the Future. âThis is classic, state-backed Internet censorship.â While bans on state and school devices are easier to implement, the university measures will be much more logistically difficult, experts say, since students can still easily get around them by using cellular data instead. âThis specific ban will likely count as barely an inconvenience for the students subject to it, and it would be incredibly difficult, if not impossible, both technically and ethically, to enforce students using TikTok on their own personal devices,â said Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at cybersecurity firm Vulcan Cyber. This could also lead to data networks being clogged on campuses, making student devices run more slowly and ineffectively. TikTok spokesperson Jamal Brown criticized the ban, and warned there could be unintended consequences for studentsâ ability to share information and connect on campus. âWeâre disappointed that so many states are jumping on the political bandwagon to enact policies that will do nothing to advance cybersecurity in their states and are based on unfounded falsehoods about TikTok,â he said. Most of these bans were enacted by schools that take government funds in states such as Texas where lawmakers are already waging political war on TikTok. This chapter marks just the latest example of global culture wars playing out on college campuses, Carusone said. Whether the counterculture movement of the 1960s, the Satanic panic of the 1980s, or allegations of liberal indoctrination on college campuses that began in the 1990s and continue today, young people are often used as pawns in larger political battles. âCollege campuses can be an important frontline for how the rest of the culture and the political landscape deals with the actual problem,â he said. âPart of the reason political figures feel as though they can get away with these kinds of things is that they feel there wonât be political consequences, they think young people donât have political power.â Carusone said the battle will only ramp up in coming months, as we move into a presidential primary season during which being âtough on Chinaâ is seen as beneficial to both Democrats and Republicans. âThis is going to be a new focus where theyâre all going to try to out-match each other,â he said. âItâs fertile ground, but TikTok is a red herring because such security concerns exist with all platforms. It ends up being a hyper-political issue that does not respond to actual threats.â The bans distract from legitimate issues at hand, said Gillian Diebold of the Center for Data Innovation, including data privacy, app security and national security. What would be more effective, she added, are measures like passing national data privacy legislation, or mandating transparency around what data is collected and enforcing end-to-end encryption on all social media apps. âTargeting one single app is not going to make a dent in combatting these real issues,â she said. âThese problems exist on every social media app out there, not just TikTok.â",Guardian,20/01/2023,The new frontier in the US war on TikTok: university campuses,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/20/us-tiktok-bans-university-campuses
73,"The author explores the popularity of true crime content on TikTok and its influence on amateur sleuthing. They humorously describe their own attempt to create a ""binder"" of personal data in case they are ever murdered, mimicking the style of true crime investigations. The author highlights the absurdity and fascination surrounding the genre while acknowledging its potential ugliness. The passage showcases the author's affinity for true crime and the theatrical nature of their endeavor.


","If I was a more dedicated podcast listener, I am certain I would be a nutter for true crime, a genre with which I share many core values: a zeal for prying into the lives of total strangers, a generally melodramatic way of talking, an overactive imagination which crafts grand, paranoid narratives from the most quotidian of events. (These are also the traits of anyone who did theatre in high school.) TikTok, apparently, agrees. When Serial exploded the genre in 2014, the power of amateur sleuths â and the sway they possessed over the real-world results of justice â was still a novelty. Now, nearly a decade on, new mysteries sweep through TikTok at dizzying pace. Everyone from awkward boyfriends to supposedly nefarious fiances are held to account on the platform by users conducting their own frenzied investigations, hoping to catch their suspects cheating, philandering and premeditating. The jurors: a million deranged zoomers. The tone: nothing short of fever pitch â the type that accompanies all good conspiracy theories. All of this can be ugly. But it can also be funny: as in a video which has made the rounds in the past month where one true crime obsessive shows off their fastidiously arranged binder containing fingerprints, handwriting samples, locks of hair, medical records â in case they, you know, get murdered and someone decides to start a podcast about it. See above: theatre kids. Theyâve labelled this a â5 things in case I go missing binderâ, which is a very dry way to describe your own kidnapping. Like all TikToks, the video makes it look somehow sane and easy to collect all the things that would be necessary in a murder investigation. But I wasnât so sure. *In an extremely true crime voice* I knew I had to investigate, and by investigate I mean assemble my own assortment of personal data in the unlikely scenario that I am murdered. (If you are reading this, please do not murder me.) I make a quick decision to forgo the fingerprint samples, as I have not had access to an ink pad since I was seven and deep into my spy era, when I would subject everyone around me to spontaneous and annoying âforensicâ âinspectionsâ. This says a lot about me. Moving onwards: a lock of hair. Luckily, I am able to unearth a pair of barber scissors from the back of the toiletries cupboard. I grit my teeth and lop off one measly bang â then I realise, via a very unscientific Google search, that you are meant to rip your hair out from its roots so that a DNA sample can eventually be procured by a bored 20-year-old scrolling through TikTok. Because I have the pain tolerance of a toddler, I opt out of this cruel and unusual punishment and instead sticky-tape the chunk Iâve already chopped off to a sheet of A4 paper. Next, a handwriting sample â easy enough, though I am convinced my carpal muscles have atrophied to the point that merely holding a pen could give me an immediate RSI. As usual, I am being melodramatic. I am not, however, being melodramatic when a bolt of fear strikes me at the thought of attaining my medical records â the fourth requirement in this binder. For posterity, I phone up the last doctorâs office I haphazardly looked up. They put me on hold for 15 minutes and the line goes dead. I apologise to all future podcasters who are now unaware I had asthma from the ages of five to 12. At last, my binder is almost complete. The final piece is a list of everyone I know and their contact details because, according to the TikTok, âmy friends and exes are the first people they need to bring in for questioningâ. Personally, it seems like the primary suspects should be my enemies, but what do I know? I reach out to an ex and tell him I am including him in my file. âIf you were to murder me,â I ask him, âhow would you do it?â Perhaps, I think, he will reply with something ludicrous: a sensational homicide plot straight out of a slasher. Or maybe heâll be cautious, or even outraged that I could implicate him in such wicked deeds. Instead, his response is entirely unblinking. âSlow poison or choking,â he texts back instantly, as if he has stewed on this many times before. This is when I know the binder has gone too far.

74,"Over 20 children in Indonesia were injured after participating in a TikTok trend involving a street snack infused with liquid nitrogen known as ""dragon's breath."" The government has issued warnings about the dangers of consuming food with liquid nitrogen, as it can cause burns, food poisoning, and even death if consumed before evaporation. The Ministry of Health has called for supervision of establishments using liquid nitrogen and educational measures in schools to raise awareness of the risks.","More than 20 children have been hurt in Indonesia after taking part in a TikTok trend in which they are filmed devouring a street snack infused with liquid nitrogen known colloquially as âdragonâs breathâ. The government has warned of the dangers of using liquid nitrogen in ready-to-eat food and urged greater vigilance after some children suffered stomach burns and food poisoning while eating chiki ngebul or chikibulis â a rainbow assortment of candies coated in a cloud of liquid nitrogen mist. The liquid nitrogen causes the snack to appear to smoke when consumed but if it is consumed before the liquid nitrogen has evaporated, there is the potential for intestinal burns and perforations, and in the most severe cases it can lead to death, said Dr Dicky Budiman, an Indonesian doctor and researcher of global health security at Griffith University. Skin burns and severe breathing difficulties are other potential risks, the Indonesian ministry of healthâs director general, Maxi Rein Rondonuwu, said in a statement. No deaths have been reported, but the ministry said around 25 children have been affected, with two hospitalised. Budiman said the number of children affected could be much higher. The ministry has asked local health agencies to supervise restaurants using liquid nitrogen whilst informing them of how consumers can enjoy it safely. âMobile hawker food outletsâ are advised against selling such snacks at all. It has also asked schools to educate children about the dangers. On TikTok, dozens of videos, accompanied by dance music, show teenagers and young children with tendrils of smoke coming from their mouths as they devour chiki ngebul. In one video that has racked up nearly 60,000 views, a toddler can be seen puffing the smoke through the hole in the sweet. Although the snack has been around for several years and liquid nitrogen is commonly used in food, such snacks are now easier to access than they historically have been, said Budiman. âMaybe now itâs decreasing [in price] and not only easier to access but also the number of new businesses using this liquid nitrogen is also increasingâ, he said. Theyâre often sold by street vendors, and many food handlers donât know how to use liquid nitrogen properly, while children arenât aware of its dangers, said Budiman. âFor some teenagers, the experience [of] dangerous things [generates] more enthusiasm. They [are] eager to try it. Thatâs a dangerous thing,â he said.",Guardian,17/01/2023,Children hurt eating liquid nitrogen âdragonâs breathâ snack in Indonesian Tiktok trend ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/17/dragons-breath-tiktok-trend-children-hurt-indoneseia-eating-liquid-nitrogen-dragon-snack-chiki-ngebul
75,"Alex Reifsnyder, a TikTok user with 167k followers, uses a physics simulator called Floating Sandbox to create shipwreck simulations. His videos, depicting ships sinking from tidal waves, icebergs, and lightning, attract millions of views. Viewers find the content satisfying and therapeutic, with some requesting additional destruction. Reifsnyder believes his videos are educational and not meant to mock tragedies. The appeal of such simulations lies in the human tendency to pay attention to situations that provide information about threats or danger at a low cost.","A shark swims slowly and serenely beneath the Bismarck seconds before it sinks deep into the ocean. Seemingly out of nowhere, the battleship tilts and falls; its bow crashes on to the seabed. Its hull floods before briefly resurfacing out of the water. Then the voiceover says: âOh! Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh! Boom!â The Bismarck snaps in half and sinks. This was not the Bismarckâs real end, but a shipwreck simulated by Alex Reifsnyder, a 27-year-old retail supervisor from Pennsylvania. Reifsnyder uses the physics simulator Floating Sandbox to sink ships with tidal waves, icebergs and lightning for between one and two hours almost every night. On his TikTok page @an_angry_flyy, 167,000 loyal followers cannot get enough. Not even they seem to know exactly what draws them. A comment under one video from October reads: âDonât know what I am watching â¦ and why â¦ but I still come back every day.â Though some are given a soundtrack of slow, sinister music and others upbeat pop, all Reifsnyderâs videos seem to capture the terror of an eerie expanse of ocean that has the power to crush you and drag you down. The comment section reveals that viewers cannot help but picture themselves onboard: âImagine your boat goes completely airborne,â reads one, while others joke: âIâm fine, I had my seatbelt on,â and âIâd survive.â There is also a clear appetite for further destruction: âCan fire be added or an explosion?â asks one commenter. Another requests: âCould you drop it from the sky into the water?â More than 1.7 million people watched the Bismarck go boom in early October, and Reifsnyderâs most popular video has 21m views. In it, an unfathomably tall wave approaches the Bismarck as Hans Zimmerâs Cornfield Chase from the film Interstellar plays. The ship is lifted up into the air; its stern slams into the ocean and snaps in half. Water pours into the ship. In pieces, it sinks to the seabed. âIâve always had an interest in the Titanic, the Britannic, the Lusitania. Iâve watched a lot of history videos on these ships,â says Reifsnyder, who began wrecking ships in July 2022 after two years of failing to get fans by streaming the shooting game Call of Duty. Finding fans has not been a problem this time. âA lot of people find it really satisfying,â he says. âItâs actually pretty therapeutic to watch boats sink. In my streams, I create a very relaxing and inclusive environment for everybody and anybody.â Initially, Reifsnyderâs viewers were mostly men aged 15 to 35, but recently others have hopped onboard. âI have noticed more females coming in and watching,â he says, âI even have people that speak languages that I canât even recognise.â Reifsnyder is bilingual and occasionally speaks Spanish on streams. âA lot of people tell me I have a great narration voice,â he says. His commentary varies from deadpan and descriptive to excitably absurd: âItâs going to get yeeted into the air!â, âOh my, into the spikes she goes.â Dr Coltan Scrivner, an expert on morbid curiosity, argues that what keeps people coming back is that it is a form of learning. âHumans, like other animals, have a built-in cognitive bias that encourages them to pay attention to situations that can inform them about threats or danger,â says the research scientist at the Recreational Fear Lab in Aarhus University, Denmark. Scrivner says such âthreat informationâ is especially appealing âwhen the cost to look is low â such as when we watch the news, play a game or see a simulation. âOur minds see a simulated shipwreck as an opportunity to learn important and consequential information at a very low cost. This makes it difficult to look away.â Reifsnyder, too, views his content as educational, not about mocking tragedies. Unlike other games, thereâs ânobody onboardâ the ships of Floating Sandbox, and no population counter that ticks down as a vessel sinks. âThis is all about history, and weâre learning physics here,â Reifsnyder says. âHydrodynamic physics are accounted for in the game, thermodynamics are accounted for, gravity is accounted for.â Or to put it another way: Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh!

76,"In the absence of Alex Reifsnyder, TechScape's rotating cast of writers continues to cover tech news. Elon Musk remains a prominent figure, with recent tweets and the decline of Tesla's share price. The behavior of tech executives like Musk raises concerns about their disregard for norms and consequences. On the other hand, Apple's rumored release of a virtual and augmented-reality headset may revive interest in the metaverse. TikTok faced backlash after it was revealed that staff members spied on reporters, damaging the company's reputation.


","Hello and welcome to TechScape. Alex is now off on paternity leave, and in his place a rotating cast of writers will give their takes on the world of tech. Apologies to any readers who have begged Alex for fewer stories about Elon Musk and crypto, but in a post-Twitter takeover world there are no quiet weeks for tech reporters. In the last few weeks, Musk has handed over documents for the latest edition of the âTwitter Filesâ to controversial author Alex Berenson (with the not-so revelatory news that Twitter was asked not to spread vaccine misinformation); hinted that weâre getting 4,000-character long tweets; and tweeted messages about the arrest of disgraced influencer and the âking of toxic masculinityâ Andrew Tate. All of this has happened while the share price of his electric car company, Tesla, has cratered. For good or ill â and it appears mostly, so far, to be ill â Musk became the main character of 2022, Trumping tech. Which is why I hope youâll forgive us for focusing quite so much on him â and continuing to do so into 2023. Because, like Trump, Muskâs way of doing things has a butterfly effect beyond Twitter. Musk (pictured above) is redrawing the TechScape, and how we as journalists (and politicians as regulators) should treat it. Alex Hern has, like I have, long treated big tech with a healthy dose of scepticism. The Guardian was among the main outlets to hold Facebookâs feet to the fire during the Cambridge Analytica scandal; it uncovered issues with TikTokâs content moderation system; it (rightly) laughs at the metaverse. Itâs long been obvious that social media executives canât always grapple with the issues they need to, given their companiesâ central role in our society, and I personally have felt that theyâre just not up to the job of understanding their own impact. Yet with hindsight we might now appreciate how lucky we were. Even if big techâs executives werenât always up to the task, they recognised the enormity of the problem. Mark Zuckerberg made plenty of bad decisions and acted many times in his own flagrant self-interest, but he seemed to realise his companyâs position in our lives meant he had to try and keep his platform in check. Thereâs little sense of that with Musk. The risk is that, just as politicians started flouting the norms after they realised Donald Trump got away with it, other tech executives could start doing the same. We may look back on 2022 and think we never had it so good when it comes to big techâs behaviour â which is a worrying thought. The metaverse â¦ lives? Breaking news this week that the flatlining folly known as the metaverse could â and I stress could â be resuscitated. Ever since Facebook overhauled its entire business and rebranded itself as Meta in late 2021, the metaverse has been little more than a dream of Mark Zuckerbergâs looking for a use case. The reason? No consumer wants to spend thousands of pounds on virtual reality hardware (pictured above) that could increase the likelihood of tripping in their own home just to enter a universe with sub-Sims graphics. Until now. Bloomberg reports that Apple is due this spring to unveil a virtual and augmented-reality headset, in what is the worldâs worst-kept secret. Itâs a significant moment, not least because thereâs a supposition (which may be wide of the mark) that Apple could do to virtual reality headsets, and therefore the metaverse, what it did to the smartphone in 2007. Back then, people didnât see the point of having an all-in-one device that could replace oneâs camera as adeptly as it could take a call. They didnât always see the point of apps. But 16 years on, weâre in thrall to Appleâs world. The theory is that the headset, which may be called Reality Pro, could propel the metaverse out of the realm of wonky tech nerds and into the mainstream. But as with everything Apple, itâll come at a (hefty) cost. The metaverse just got interesting again. Ticktock for TikTok? Another major news story broke in the tech world. TikTok slipped up for the first time â and it was a biggie. Two days before Christmas, TikTok sent an internal email from parent company ByteDance general counsel Erich Andersen revealing that staff members spied on reporters covering the company. I have some experience covering TikTok and, like a phalanx of reporters, I have been searching for the story that torpedoes the company. Not out of malice, but because every tech company has skeletons in the closet. So far, plenty of talented reporters couldnât find much beyond the issues that blight every big tech company: bullying (Â£), content moderation missteps and white lies (Â£) that aim to make the platform seem less intrusive than it is. It turns out that we didnât need to dig to find the smoking gun. TikTok did it for us. Itâs hard to overestimate how much of an own goal their spying is for TikTok. Sinosceptic politicians in the UK and US, for instance, might argue it confirms their fears that the company is not truly westernising itself, and they might argue that claims TikTok is unmooring itself from Chinese government control are little more than lip service. The spying decision is, in its own way, as significant as Elon Musk ripping up of the rule book on how to be a big tech executive. Itâs the worst possible start to 2023 for TikTok, and means the company must rebuild trust not just with politicians and users but also with the reporters who cover the company.

77,"A growing number of content creators on platforms like TikTok are making videos about self-described tics, Tourette syndrome, and other self-diagnosed disorders, potentially driven by limited mental health treatment options. In other news, supporters of Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro stormed the country's congress and other key locations, echoing the US Capitol invasion. Also, an eight-year-old student's shooting of a teacher in Virginia was deemed deliberate, Naomi Osaka withdrew from the Australian Open, and England plans to ban certain single-use plastics.


","Good morning and welcome back to the first Morning Mail for 2023. New research says video-sharing platforms like TikTok are seeing a growing number of content creators making videos about their self-described tics, Tourette syndrome and other self-diagnosed disorders. This has coincided with increasing numbers of youth who have presented to clinical providers or psychiatric services with functional tic-like behaviours.

78,"Rufford ford, an ancient river crossing in England, has been closed due to its popularity on TikTok. The ford, known for its treacherous conditions after heavy rain, attracted millions of views on social media as cars attempted to drive through it. Local authorities decided to close the crossing due to safety concerns, as over-optimistic drivers risked their vehicles and safety for viral fame. The closure disappointed YouTubers who had capitalized on the ford's popularity but also highlighted the demand for online content featuring cars driving through water.","Deep in the English countryside is an ancient river crossing that has been used, in various forms, for at least 1,000 years. It featured in the Domesday Book, attracted Cistercian monks who built an abbey nearby, and more recently served as a handy shortcut for Nottinghamshire commuters. But Rufford ford has now been closed, after clips of cars driving through it attracted hundreds of millions of views on TikTok. âThat ford has been there since Adam was a lad,â said Neil Clarke, a local councillor. He decided to close the crossing this month after requests from the fire and police services, who were unable to cope with a small rural lane becoming one of the most famous roads in the world. âWith the age of social media it has become a tourist attraction. People are driving there specifically to have a go at going through the ford. They donât realise how deep it is and suddenly their car starts floating,â Clarke said. Rufford ford cuts across Rainworth Water, a small river east of Mansfield. When the weather is dry, the river crosses the road as a small trickle that is easily traversed. But after heavy rain it becomes several feet deep and up to 30ft (9 metres) wide, and the crossing resembles a log flume at a theme park. Over-optimistic drivers have a moment of realisation as their cars are turned into a boat. As their engines fill up with water, they are left begging onlookers to tow them out. For years this was a local concern. Then in 2020, a local teenager called Ben Gregory started uploading videos he had filmed to YouTube of cars conking out in the water. Suddenly, a small Nottinghamshire lane was a global tourist attraction with an obsessive fanbase. âPeople love seeing pain and failure,â said another YouTuber, who insisted on being referred to by his online username midlifecrisis101x. âThey donât want to seeing people winning. What they want to do is to watch idiots and go: âIâm having a really bad day but heâs having a worse one.ââ This 50-year-old YouTuber has spent months filming at the ford alongside Gregory. He said audiences delighted in watching other people failing. âItâs wanton stupidity. Youâve got a perfectly good motor vehicle and a sign that says road closed. Why are you going to put your car in that?â Capturing a car failing can take hours of time, with the YouTubers filming hundreds of crossings before getting footage that elicits peak schadenfreude, such as a waterlogged BMW or Mercedes. âIt is relaxing there â itâs like fishing. But youâre fishing for cars,â midlifecrisis101x said. As for the motivation of those crossing the river, he believes there is a deep âbloodlustâ on the part of drivers who want to drive a vehicle worth tens of thousands of pounds through a flooded ford. âItâs like when somebody knows theyâre about to do something wrong, they wonât look around, and they carry on and do it anyway.â The global interest in Rufford ford quickly became hard to manage. Large crowds turned up on the narrow, tree-lined country lane, parking their cars and bringing their families to spend a day cheering drivers attempting the crossing. Local businesses did a strong trade in ice-creams. Nottinghamshire police had to divert officers to manage numbers. Other YouTubers and influencers turned up, creating a bank of cameras filming every crossing. Occasionally, the fire service had to send staff to help pull cars out. Midlifecrisis101x said: âI had a guy come over from Germany and spend a week in his car in the car park. Twice. Heâd just sit there with his supply of food and watch.â The videos became valuable YouTube content, with the creators receiving a cut of the siteâs advertising revenue, earning tens of thousands of pounds. But the crowd control really began to get out of control over the course of this year as the videos made their way from a core loyal audience on YouTube to TikTok, where algorithm-driven recommendations drove millions of new viewers to the mill. This intense attention provided by TikTok, according to midlifecrisis101x, resulted in a change in the type of person who was coming to the ford. âTikTok attracts a more excitable audience who want instant entertainment, they want 15 to 20 seconds of high-adrenaline consumption. The high-energy people came to Rufford ford. It was originally fishing for cars, and then TikTok brought more energy â and not in a good way.â Clarke, who is the cabinet member responsible for highways and environment at Nottinghamshire county council, said crowds were encroaching on the road and it was becoming a public safety hazard. âWe had complaints saying weâre spoiling everyoneâs fun. Iâm sure itâs great entertainment and people go to watch the spectacle, but I donât think people realise thereâs a lot of danger and hazard. Very quickly things like this can change to a tragedy.â The councillor said the ever-growing online attention had caused people to attempt riskier crossings in recent months. âThere was a motorcyclist who approached it at 50mph, went full pelt, and came straight off head over heels over the handlebars. He went so fast he bounced all the way along the water before collapsing on the other side in a heap. It is life-threatening.â For now, locals will have to wait while the council decides what to do with the accidentally viral road crossing. Clarke said a replacement bridge was out of the question on cost grounds, but traffic calming measures are being considered. Meanwhile, the group of Rufford ford YouTubers are convinced theyâve tapped into strong demand for online content about cars driving through water â and hope to recreate their camaraderie at a new site. âIt is a beautiful location and other fords arenât the same,â said midlifecrisis101x. âBut thatâs why weâre focusing on the chemistry on-screen.â",Guardian,7/01/2023,TikTok car-fishing craze leads to closure of ancient Rufford ford,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/07/tiktok-car-fishing-craze-leads-to-closure-of-ancient-rufford-ford
79,"A new TikTok trend involves memes featuring borzois, long-nosed dogs, and various objects that resemble them. The popularity of borzois on TikTok, along with Muppet song covers, has led to the creation of these memes. Objects such as taps, pencil dots, and even a slice of pizza are being compared to borzois, evoking humor and a sense of poignancy. The trend highlights the fleeting nature of life and the influence of FKA twigs' music, even when covered by a Muppet.


","OK Calla, apparently there is a new TikTok trend that has not yet filtered through to Instagram, where geriatric millennials like me can âdiscoverâ it. Tell me about it. Jo, Iâm so glad you asked. To understand this meme, you need to know two very important things about TikTok. The first is that the good people of the clock app are absolutely mad about borzois, or Russian wolfhounds. You know, the lanky, wispy-haired dogs that look like they have just appeared on a misty bridge at midnight to ask you their riddles three. A large part of this popularity is due to a borzoi named Esper, who sadly died last year. Esper was owned by Jacob Chattman, a US actor whose account is dedicated to the animals he calls hose goats. The hose goats, in turn, are dedicated to ruining his life by howling. The second thing you need to know is that if a song exists, there will be a Muppet cover of it on TikTok. They often sink below the waves but occasionally the algorithm will drag one to the surface and whenever that happens, a meme is born. You had me at âlanky, wispy-haired dogsâ. So what do the memes look and sound like? The essential feature of the borzoi is its extremely long nose. Just a lone pair of nostrils and then miles and miles of snout before you reach the eyes, which always convey the expression of an animal that has suffered a moral injury. They look like a stray sock with eyes on. So a few months ago, people started dueting videos of borzois with a googly-eyed sock puppet. Then people realised that if you draw two little dots on a HB pencil, that also looks like a borzoi. Around Christmas time, a video of another dog that looks like a pencil with eyes was dueted by a pencil with eyes that looked like the dog, paired with the FKA twigs song Cellophane as sung by Miss Piggy. And now I cannot escape it. Everything looks like a borzoi. Surely not that many objects look like a long-faced European dog? Hotel room taps. The pump dispenser on a bottle of moisturiser. Other dogs with slightly less long noses (one of the earliest memes featured a Silken windhound). Anteaters. A doorstop. A collection of taxidermy at Oxford Museum. A banana. Shelving brackets. A skinny slice of pizza. Whatever this thing is in the birthing ward with Jacob Chattman and his partner and new son (congrats btw). They are everywhere. Oh my. I find this both very funny and weirdly â¦ poignant? I want to adopt all these weird little triangular objects. How can a skinny slice of pizza make me feel so much? It may be because sighthounds, with their short life spans, remind us of the ephemeral nature of life. Their soulful eyes, or two burnt patches on a skinny piece of pizza, tell us that every moment is to be treasured. But I suspect the real reason is that FKA twigs is a very good songwriter, even when being covered by a Muppet.",Guardian,6/01/2023,"Why is TikTok obsessed with dogs that look like pizza slices, and why is that making me sad?",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/06/why-is-tiktok-obsessed-with-dogs-that-look-like-pizza-slices-and-why-is-that-making-me-sad
80,"In 2022, live pop shows made a comeback after a challenging period for the music industry. Along with high-priced tickets, the trend of sharing concert experiences on social media became prominent. Designers increasingly aimed to create visually appealing sets that would translate well on platforms like TikTok and Twitter. Considerations included the ability to capture captivating footage and minimizing environmental impact. Notable tours by Lady Gaga, Lorde, Rosala, and the 1975 incorporated designs that embraced the aesthetic and theatricality of social media. The return of live shows generated viral moments and a sense of joy for both performers and audiences.","After a punishing two years for the live music industry, pop shows returned with full force in 2022, with many of the worldâs top-tier stars jostling to see their fans in a live setting once again. Punters have been faced with an embarrassment of riches, from Harry Stylesâ multi-night US arena residencies to Charli XCXâs Grecian rave fantasia to Dua Lipaâs Studio 54-esque disco spectacular. But even if you couldnât afford the higher-than-ever price tags for big pop shows â the result of a significant labour shortage and the need for artists to recoup losses after two years without touring â it was also easier than ever, in 2022, to experience shows from afar. The yearâs most-talked about tours â Lady Gagaâs Chromatica Ball, Lordeâs Solar Power tour, RosalÃ­a for Motomami and the 1975âs At Their Very Best â felt as though they were designed to be shared on social media, with clips from each show proving inescapable on TikTok and Twitter. Each night of Gagaâs tour trended on Twitter; each new 1975 show has led to a flood of new footage of frontman Matty Healy doing all manner of outrageous things from kissing fans to eating raw meat. For fans watching online, the beats of each show became as indelible as the actual hits. Tobias Rylander, who designed the 1975âs tour, says heâs always trying to put together âa show that reads well on social mediaâ. Over his time working with the band over the past decade, he says, his designs have become increasingly âInstagram-readyâ â the bandâs previous tour, for example, featured vertical screens, âso people could actually hold their phone the way they wanted to and take pretty pictures.â Rylander even says that he tries to design shows âso that any fans googling or YouTubing the show will be able to tell, by the colour of the thumbnail, what year it was and what song it wasâ. For the 1975 At Their Very Best tour, Rylander and the band wanted to highlight the performers onstage â a shift from the bright LED screens and coloured lights of past shows â so he instead conceptualised a house set lit in white, like a theatre production. Part of this was due to Covid: Rylander says that because lighting technology, trucks and crews are âtwice, if not three timesâ more expensive than pre-pandemic, âwe couldnât afford the big, expensive tech lightsâ. Rylander and the band were also conscious of their environmental impact, and the house set allowed them to build a show with few bespoke parts that would have to be shipped from continent to continent. Instead, the set is largely built of steel and aluminium, and has created âminimal landfill wasteâ. Still, one thing didnât change: âWe wanted the set to read well on camera, both moving image and still.â Rylander isnât the only designer keeping fan footage in mind when working with pop stars. LeRoy Bennett, a lighting and production designer who works extensively with Lady Gaga, as well as Paul McCartney, Ariana Grande and the Weeknd, says that he and Gaga were âabsolutelyâ thinking about social media when designing the Chromatica Ball. âI take that approach quite a bit because social media has become such a big part of the world,â he says. When conceptualising the Chromatica Ball, Bennett was drawn to the âstark, strong, harshâ world of brutalist architecture; the resulting show featured a dramatic grey set bright enough to be perfectly captured for social media and neutral enough for Gagaâs outlandish outfits to stand in stark relief. âThe people way at the back have to see the artist â so when you light an artist, you have to pretty much do what you would do for a television show,â he says. âItâs a combination of theatre and TV, and a rock show and a pop show. It lends itself to that social media-friendly atmosphere.â The clean, dynamic design of the Chromatica Ball is mirrored in the sets of RosalÃ­a, the 1975 and Lorde. RosalÃ­a performs on a brightly lit white backdrop against which she and her dancers dance and scoot around the stage. Lordeâs show is architectural and geometric â and plainly striking enough for one fan to get a tattoo of the showâs bold centrepiece. All four shows look great on TikTok. In RosalÃ­aâs, the gigantic vertical screens on each side the stage outright mimic the video-sharing appâs interface. Phones are situated around the stage for her musicians and dancers to broadcast to the screens throughout the show, with certain moments â selfie videos with fans taken from high-up, a spare ballad with a phone propped against the piano lid as she plays â echoing the familiar visual formatting and intimacy of popular videos on the platform. Chiara Stephenson, a stage designer who has worked with BjÃ¶rk and the xx, and who worked on Lordeâs tour, describes herself as a âtheatre creatureâ â she trained under Michael Grandage and Christopher Oram â and says she wanted to bring a âtheatrical sensibilityâ to the Solar Power shows. Unlike Bennett and Rylander, Stephenson says that she wasnât thinking about social media when working on the tour, despite the telegenic setup. âWith the amount of people coming to see the show over the months, you canât get away with it just being aesthetic,â she says. âWhat [Lorde] is doing is so rooted and grounded in the music that the law for us was: whatâs enhancing the music? Whatâs telling a story?â Lordeâs intention, she says, was to step away from the gargantuan LED screens that are often standard in pop shows and return to something more analogue, but still distinctive. âIâm most excited, when youâre in an arena or theatre, feeling the three-dimensionality of the light coming through whatever the sculpture or design is on stage,â Stephenson says. âThatâs something you canât ever really capture â Iâm delighted that it photographed well, but that wasnât the guiding reason.â Even so, itâs undeniable that many of the yearâs most viral moments on TikTok were derived from live shows this year: RosalÃ­a elaborately chewing gum during her song Bizcochito, Healy relentlessly touching his crotch, Gaga belting a power ballad while wearing an Edward Scissorhands-style claw and standing on a flaming stage. Perhaps these moments are reverse-engineered to go viral or, perhaps, fans are just sharing more content than they used to, thrilled to be back in arenas and metres away from their heroes. âDoing shows after all this time, itâs a joyous moment for the audience,â says Bennett. âPeople always want to go to see live entertainment. I mean â you can only watch so much TV.â The 1975âs At Their Very Best UK tour starts in Brighton on 8 January",Guardian,5/01/2023,Screen and heard: is TikTok changing the way pop stars perform?,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/05/screen-and-heard-tiktok-changing-pop-shows-rosalia-lorde-1975

Hancock announced the closure in a post, thanking users for their support. He recommended following him on TikTok instead. The app was not Hancock's only digital venture, as he had also planned to address the Conservative party conference as a hologram. He recently announced he would not seek re-election and participated in a reality TV show.","Matt Hancock has closed his personal app, five years after its launch made it a 24-hour social media hit. The Matt Hancock MP app was launched in 2018 when the West Suffolk MP was culture secretary as part of Theresa Mayâs government. He said he hoped it would keep his constituents up-to-date and âpromote a healthy, open and impartial debate within its communityâ. However, within hours it was full of users, many who were journalists or people trolling the MP, who realised that they did not have to live in Hancockâs patch to become members. One early post that gained popularity was someone posing as Ed Balls, mimicking his famous âEd Ballsâ tweet. Settings were later changed to discourage non-constituents from registering. In a post released on the app on Tuesday, Hancock announced he was calling time on his virtual venture.

82,"Social media platforms TikTok and Twitter are facing criticism for allowing the spread of misinformation by followers of Andrew Tate, who was arrested in connection with a human trafficking investigation. False claims and conspiracy theories surrounding his arrest have circulated on the platforms. Tate, known for his misogynistic views, was arrested in Romania. Supporters have claimed he was framed, while others blamed ""the Matrix."" Concerns have been raised about the impact on legal proceedings and the role of social media in promoting Tate's content. TikTok and Twitter are being urged to take action.


","Social media firms are under fire this weekend for allowing the spread of misinformation by followers of âking of toxic masculinityâ Andrew Tate after his arrest in connection with a human trafficking investigation. In the hours after his detention, TikTok and Twitter were flooded with posts falsely claiming he had been freed and conspiracy theories saying he had been set up, Observer analysis shows. Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said: âHaving conspiracy theories proliferating which might put at risk the integrity of an investigation or the safety of those involved is unconscionable.â Tate, 36, a British-American internet personality best known for his misogynistic views, was arrested with his brother Tristan in Romania on 29 December as part of an investigation into human trafficking, rape and organised crime. An investigation by the Observer in August into the former kickboxer and Big Brother contestant revealed that TikTok was aggressively promoting his content to users including boys and young men. Members of Tateâs online academy had been instructed to post deliberately controversial clips in an effort to boost engagement and manipulate the algorithm. After his arrest last week, a statement from prosecutors said four people, including two Britons, were suspected of being part of a criminal group that sexually exploited women after luring them with promises of a relationship. The women were allegedly subjected to âphysical violence and mental coercion through intimidation, constant surveillance, control and invoking alleged debtsâ and forced to make pornographic videos. Six potential victims had been identified. Further details of the specific allegations against Tate have not been made public. On Friday, it was confirmed that he would spend the next 30 days in detention as Romaniaâs Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism continues its inquiries. On social media, thousands of supporters have already reached their verdict. On TikTok and Twitter, Tateâs fans claimed without evidence that he had been framed, using hashtags such as #freetopG and #tateinnocent. âPeople lie because they hate Tate,â one wrote on Twitter. âIâm 100% sure Tate is innocent. FREE TATE,â said another. Others blamed âthe Matrixâ for setting him up. This was fuelled by Tate himself in a tweet posted after news of his arrest: âThe Matrix sent their agents,â he wrote on Friday. Since the release of the 1999 sci-fi film about people living in a simulation, where a man is given the choice to take a red pill and âwake upâ, the metaphor has been repeatedly repurposed in a range of conspiracy theories, as well by fringe online groups who use âredpillâ to mean men waking up to the ârealityâ that feminism subjugates them. On TikTok on Friday, the most-liked recent video about Tate was one that appeared at first to be a factual report but ended by asking viewers: âWhat do you guys think is the real reason Tate was arrested? Was it the Matrix, or did Tate actually commit a serious crime?â On Twitter, where Tate has more than 4m followers after his account was reinstated in November, many posts referenced #Pizzagate â a debunked theory that predated QAnon and claimed senior Democrats were behind a child sexual abuse ring â and suggested he was being used as a scapegoat by real paedophile rings. In a video made shortly before his arrest, after a Twitter spat with the climate activist Greta Thunberg, Tate had appeared on camera with a pizza box in front of him in what some speculated was a reference to the conspiracy. âThey want to cover up Pizzagate with Andrew Tate,â one Twitter user wrote, tagging Elon Musk. Other accounts posted old videos suggesting Tate had been cleared, despite him remaining in detention. One clip viewed 780,000 times on Twitter by Saturday claimed to show him being freed from custody. âAndrew Tate got Released Matrix attack Failed,â the caption read. The fierce defence of Tate and spread of misinformation since his arrest will add to concerns about the impact on any future legal proceedings and raise questions for the social media platforms that helped propel him to the mainstream.

83,"The US government has approved a ban on TikTok usage on federal government devices, citing national security concerns over its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The ban requires federal employees to remove the app unless used for national security or law enforcement purposes. The move adds to ongoing uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future in the US. While some argue for more comprehensive action against the app, others highlight the potential impact on free speech and suggest alternative measures to address data and privacy concerns.","The US government has approved an unprecedented ban on the use of TikTok on federal government devices. The restrictions â tucked into a spending bill just days before it was passed by Congress, and signed by Joe Biden on Thursday â add to growing uncertainty about the appâs future in the US amid a crackdown from state and federal lawmakers. Officials say the ban is necessary due to national security concerns about the China-based owner of the app, ByteDance. But it also leaves many questions unanswered. Hereâs what you need to know. Why did the ban happen? The US government has banned TikTok on federal government-issued devices due to national security concerns over its China-based parent company, ByteDance. The US fears that the Chinese government may leverage TikTok to access those devices and US user data. TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter said the company was âdisappointedâ that Congress moved forward with the proposal and that it was âa political gesture that will do nothing to advance national security interestsâ. The ban means that, in about two months, federal government employees will be required to remove TikTok from their government-issued devices unless they are using the app for national security or law enforcement activities. The director of the US Office of Management and Budget and other offices have 60 days to come up with standards and processes for all government employees to remove the app from their phones. Several federal agencies such as the White House and the defense, homeland security and state departments have already banned TikTok, so it wonât change anything for those employees. And earlier this week, Catherine Szpindor, the chief administrator of the House of Representatives, also instructed all staff and lawmakers to delete the app from their devices. How did we get here? US security concerns about TikTok have existed for years. Donald Trump first attempted, unsuccessfully, to ban TikTok in 2020, but bipartisan efforts to regulate and rein in use of the app reached a fever pitch in 2022 after news outlets reported ByteDance employees were accessing US TikTok user information. National security concerns were reinforced by warnings from the FBI director, Christopher Wray, that the Chinese government could use the app to gain access to US usersâ devices. Several, predominantly Republican-led states â including Texas, South Dakota and Virginia â have also recently banned the use of TikTok on state government-issued devices. In April, Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a similar ban to the one now taking effect, calling TikTok a âTrojan horse for the Chinese Communist partyâ. The measure, the contours of which were largely replicated in the ban that was passed on Friday, was unanimously approved by the Senate earlier in December. Have other countries taken similar actions against TikTok? While other countries such as Indonesia have imposed temporary bans on TikTok, the biggest country that continues to prohibit the use of the app is India. India permanently banned TikTok along with more than 50 other Chinese apps after a deadly border dispute with China, citing national security concerns. National bans in other countries have not lasted more than, at most, a few months. Should we be more worried about TikTok than other apps? It depends on whom you ask. Several digital privacy and civil advocacy groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Fight for the Future say while the potential for China to exploit access to TikTok is indeed concerning, other apps and services offer government entities, including in the US, similar access to user data. âUnless weâre also [going to] ban Twitter and Facebook and YouTube and Uber and Grubhub, this is pointless,â said the Fight for the Future director, Evan Greer. âYes, itâs possibly a bit easier for the Chinese government to gain access to data through TikTok than other apps, but thereâs just so many ways governments can get data from apps.â But lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have introduced bills and applauded efforts to limit the use of TikTok. In addition to Hawleyâs bill, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida introduced a bill to ban the company from operating in the US entirely. âThis isnât about creative videos â this is about an app that is collecting data on tens of millions of American children and adults every day,â Rubio said in a press release announcing the bipartisan bill. The Democratic senator Mark Warner of Virginia has also encouraged efforts to ban TikTok on government devices and called for more states to âtake action to keep our government technology out of the CCPâs [Chinese Communist partyâs] reachâ. What are the geopolitical implications of this ban? The US has ramped up its efforts to address potential national security concerns from China over the last few years, including adding more China-based companies and entities to a commerce department blacklist limiting exports to those firms. The focus on TikTok is part of this larger campaign, but some groups warn that a ban on TikTok would lead to similar moves from China. âBlanket bans on apps based on a companyâs foreign ownership will only hurt US businesses in the long run because countries could seek to block US online services over similar national security concerns,â said Gillian Diebold, a policy analyst at the Center for Data Innovation. Like other privacy advocates, Diebold said that âpolicymakers should pursue more promising solutions that address the underlying risks. âFor example, to address data concerns, lawmakers should prioritize passing federal privacy legislation to protect consumer data that would explicitly require companies to disclose who they share data with and hold them accountable for those statements,â Diebold said. Could the US ever ban TikTok outright? There have been several attempts at banning TikTok from operating in the US entirely. Rubioâs bill, for instance, would block all of the companyâs commercial operations in the US. But the viability of such bans have yet to be proved. Trumpâs previous attempt to ban new users from downloading TikTok was blocked in court in part due to free speech concerns. The EFF general counsel, Kurt Opsahl, said a total ban is a violation of free speech and while Rubioâs bill and similar proposed laws to ban TikTok purportedly âprotect America from Chinaâs authoritarian governmentâ, they actually adopt âone of the hallmarks of the Chinese internet strategyâ. âA government is within its rights to set rules and restrictions on use of official devices it owns, but trying to ban TikTok from public use is something else entirely,â Opsahl said. âTikTokâs security, privacy and its relationship with the Chinese government is indeed concerning, but a total ban is not the answer,â he continued. âA total ban is not narrowly tailored to the least restrictive means to address the security and privacy concerns, and instead lays a censorial blow against the speech of millions of ordinary Americans.â",Guardian,31/12/2022,Why did the US just ban TikTok from government-issued cellphones?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/30/explainer-us-congress-tiktok-ban
84,"TikTok has been banned on all federal government devices in the US due to security concerns. The ban was included in a spending bill signed by President Joe Biden. Federal employees must remove the app, except for national security or law enforcement purposes. Similar bans have been implemented by state governments. Legislation to ban TikTok completely has also been introduced. Concerns revolve around data access by the Chinese government. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, claims US user data is stored locally, but reports of data access have raised alarms.","TikTok has been banned on all federal government devices in the US, with limited exceptions, after Joe Biden signed a $1.7tn (Â£1.4tn) spending bill on Thursday containing a provision that outlaws the China-based app over growing security concerns. The ban â which was approved by Congress in a vote last week â is a major step targeting the fastest-growing social media platform in the world as opponents express worry user data stored in China could be accessed by the government. Various government agencies will develop rules for implementing the ban over the next two months. It will mean that federal government employees are required to remove TikTok from their government-issued devices unless they are using the app for national security or law enforcement activities. It follows a flurry of legislative action against the platform in the US, after more than a dozen governors have issued similar orders prohibiting state employees from using TikTok on state-owned devices. Earlier this week, Congress passed legislation to ban TikTok on devices issued to members of the House of Representatives. Meanwhile, there has been a push to ban TikTok outright in the US, with legislation introduced by Senator Marco Rubio earlier this month to âban Beijing-controlled TikTok for goodâ. That bill echoes moves from the previous administration, after Donald Trump issued an executive order in August 2020 prohibiting US companies from doing business with TikTokâs parent company ByteDance. The order was later revoked by Biden in June 2021 under the condition that the US committee on foreign investment (CFIUS) conducted a security review of the platform and suggested a path forward. In a statement, TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter said that the CFIUS agreement, which is still under review, would âmeaningfully address any security concerns that have been raised at both the federal and state levelâ. âWeâre disappointed that Congress has moved to ban TikTok on government devicesâa political gesture that will do nothing to advance national security interestsârather than encouraging the Administration to conclude its national security review,â she said. Although ByteDance is based in China, the company has long claimed all US user data is stored in data centers in Virginia and backed up in Singapore. But political pressure began to build anew after BuzzFeed reported in June that China-based ByteDance employees had accessed US TikTok user data multiple times between September 2021 and January 2022. Legislators have expressed concern that the Chinese Communist party could manipulate young users with pro-China content on its algorithmic home page and access sensitive user data. âTikTok, their parent company ByteDance, and other China-based tech companies are required by Chinese law to share their information with the Communist party,â Senator Mark Warner said in July when calling for further investigation of the platform. âAllowing access to American data, down to biometrics such as face prints and voice prints, poses a great risk to not only individual privacy but to national security,â he added. The legislative pressure on TikTok comes as the app has exploded in popularity in recent years, amassing a user base of more than 1 billion after reporting a 45% increase in monthly active users between July 2020 and July 2022. In 2022 it became the most downloaded app in the world, quietly surpassing longstanding forebears Instagram and Twitter. With the meteoric rise has come broad concerns about the appâs impact on its relatively young users. Nearly half of people between 18 and 30 in the US use the platform, a recent Pew Research Center report showed â and 67% of users between the ages of 13 and 18 use the app daily.",Guardian,30/12/2022,US bans China-based TikTok app on all federal government devices,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/30/us-tiktok-ban-government-devices-china
85,TikTok has been banned on devices issued by the US House of Representatives. The ban was initiated by the chief administrative officer due to concerns about the app's data protection and ties to China. It follows previous warnings about the app's risks and comes as Congress passed a spending bill that includes a provision banning TikTok on government devices. Several US states have also restricted TikTok on state-managed devices. TikTok has criticized the bans as political gestures.,"TikTok has been banned from any devices issued by the US House of Representatives, as political pressure continues to build on the Chinese-owned social video app. The order to delete the app was issued by Catherine Szpindor, the chief administrative officer (CAO) of the House, whose office had warned in August that the app represented a âhigh risk to usersâ. According to a memo obtained by NBC News, all lawmakers and staffers with House-issued mobile phones have been ordered to remove TikTok by Szpindor. âHouse staff are NOT allowed to download the TikTok app on any House mobile devices,â NBC quoted the memo as saying. âIf you have the TikTok app on your House mobile device, you will be contacted to remove it.â The move was also reported by Reuters. In a statement the US house of representatives confirmed the ban, saying âwe can confirm that the Committee on House Administration has authorized the CAO Office of Cybersecurity to initiate the removal of TikTok Social Media Service from all House-managed devices.â In August the CAO issued a âcyber advisoryâ labelling TikTok a high-risk app due to its âlack of transparency in how it protects customer dataâ. It said TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, âactively harvests content for identifiable dataâ and stores some user data in China. TikTok says its data is not held in China, but in the US and Singapore. The CAO move comes amid multiple attempts to restrict the use of TikTok by government and state employees. Last week Congress passed a $1.7tn spending bill, which includes a provision banning TikTok from government devices. The ban will take effect once President Joe Biden signs the legislation into law. According to Reuters, at least 19 US states have partially blocked the app from state-managed devices over security concerns. In a statement released after the Congress ban, TikTok said the move was a âpolitical gesture that will do nothing to advance national security interestsâ. This month the US senator Marco Rubio, a former Republican presidential contender, unveiled a legislative proposal to ban TikTok from the US entirely. Rubio said it was time to âban Beijing-controlled TikTok for goodâ. Biden has revoked presidential orders targeting TikTok issued by his predecessor, Donald Trump, which included requiring TikTok to sell its US business. However, the US Committee on Foreign Investment, which scrutinises business deals with non-US companies, is also conducting a security review of TikTok. According to a recent Reuters report, TikTok is offering to operate more of its US business at armâs length and subject it to outside scrutiny.

87,"University of Idaho professor Rebecca Scofield has filed a defamation lawsuit against TikTok user Ashley Guillard, a self-proclaimed psychic. Guillard accused Scofield of killing four students from the university, spreading baseless claims through TikTok videos. The lawsuit states that Guillard's false accusations have damaged Scofield's reputation and caused her fear for her safety. Despite cease and desist letters, Guillard continued making defamatory posts. No suspects have been publicly identified in the murder case, and Moscow police have warned against speculative and false information.","A University of Idaho professor has filed a defamation lawsuit against a self-proclaimed psychic on TikTok after the tarot card reader accused her of killing four of the schoolâs students, whose murders shocked the US last month. The federal lawsuit filed by the universityâs history department chair Rebecca Scofield on Wednesday alleges that TikTok user Ashley Guillard spread baseless claims which falsely linked the professor to the 13 November slayings of Xana Kernodle, 20; Ethan Chapin, 20; Maddie Mogen, 21; and Kaylee Goncalves, 21, in Moscow, Idaho. âAshley Guillard â a purported internet sleuth â decided to use the communityâs pain for her online self-promotion,â the lawsuit seeking damages said of Guillard, whom Scofield has never met before. Guillard has sought to take credit for solving other high-profile murders, including that of musician Takeoff, the third member of the rap group Migos. âShe has posted many videos on TikTok falsely stating plaintiff Rebecca Scofield â¦ participated in the murders because she was romantically involved with one of the victims,â the lawsuit added. âGuillardâs statements are false. Professor Scofield did not participate in the murders, and she had never met any of the victims, let alone entered a romantic relationship with them.â Guillardâs TikTok account â which states âAshley is Godâ in the bio â features dozens of videos in which she hypothesizes over the killings, often through tarot card readings. Guillard claims that Scofield had been romantically involved with one of the students and ordered their murders in attempts to hide the relationship, according to the lawsuit. In one of the videos, Guillard wrote: âI donât care what yâall say â¦ REBECCA WAS THE ONE TO INITIATE THE PLAN.â In another video, Guillard said: âRebecca Scofield is going to prison for the murder of the 4 University of Idaho Students whether you like it or not.â The lawsuit recounts how Scofield was with her husband in Portland, Oregon, visiting friends when the students were murdered. âGuillardâs videos have been viewed millions of times, amplifying Guillardâs online persona at the expense of professor Scofieldâs reputation,â said the lawsuit, which states that none of the victims ever took a class with Scofield. âShe does not recall ever meeting any one of these students,â the lawsuit said. It added: âShe does not know why Guillard picked her to repeatedly falsely accuse of ordering the tragic murders and being involved with one of the victims. Professor Scofield does know that she has been harmed by the false TikToks and false statements.â On 29 November, a lawyer sent a cease and desist letter to Guillard on behalf of Scofield. Guillard continued to post videos accusing Scofield of the murders in Moscow. On 8 December, a second cease and desist letter was sent, asking Guillard to take down her âdefamatory postsâ, the lawsuit said. âRather than change her conduct, Guillard made a TikTok showing the cease-and-desist letter â¦ and explaining that if professor Scofield, through counsel, believed that Guillard was making false statements, counsel would need to âfile actual legal documents in a federal court â¦ asking me to remove itâ.â Scofieldâs lawsuit describes how she fears that she and her family could be targeted with physical violence. Guillard has since released several TikToks in response to the lawsuit, including one in which Guillard taunts Scofield by stating: âIâm ON FIRE with excitement! SEE YOU IN COURT REBECCA SCOFIELD!!â In another video, Guillard writes: âYou sure you want to do this Rebecca SCOFIELD? This isnât going to end well for you.â So far, no suspects have been arrested or even publicly identified in the case, leaving the university community on edge. A Moscow police statement from earlier this month warned against âspeculation, without factual backing, [that is] stoking community fears and spreading false factsâ. âWe encourage referencing official releases for accurate information,â it said. The relative of one person who was considered a person of interest in the case â but has since been cleared as a suspect â spoke about how difficult the rampant speculation has been. The aunt of Jack DuCoeur, the ex-boyfriend of Kaylee Goncalves, told the New York Post her nephew ânot only lost the love of his life, and what we all thought and he probably thought as well, would be his future wife â you know, get married and have kids and all of thatâ. But also, the aunt â Brooke Miller â said, âhalf of Americaâ thinks DuCoeur could âbe responsibleâ for the murders, particularly online users. Guillard has been among those to insist on calling DuCoeur a potential suspect and that he somehow may have been involved in the murders despite the police clearing him. â¢ This article was amended on 26 December 2022.

88,"According to research by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), TikTok's recommendation algorithm promotes self-harm and eating disorder content to teenagers within minutes of them showing interest in these topics. The study found that even under-18 users were exposed to dangerously restrictive diets, pro-self-harm content, and material romanticizing suicide. The algorithm was shown to be particularly effective in pushing such content to vulnerable accounts. TikTok stated that the study did not reflect real-life user experiences and highlighted its efforts to consult with health experts and provide supportive resources.","TikTokâs recommendation algorithm pushes self-harm and eating disorder content to teenagers within minutes of them expressing interest in the topics, research suggests. The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) found that the video-sharing site will promote content including dangerously restrictive diets, pro-self-harm content and content romanticising suicide to users who show a preference for the material, even if they are registered as under-18s. For its study the campaign group set up accounts in the US, UK, Canada and Australia, registered with ages of 13, the minimum age for joining the service. It created âstandardâ and âvulnerableâ accounts, the latter containing the term âloseweightâ in their usernames, which CCDH said reflected research showing that social media users who seek out eating disorder content often choose usernames containing related language. The accounts âpaused brieflyâ on videos about body image, eating disorders and mental health, and also liked them. This took place over a 30-minute initial period when the accounts launched, in an attempt to capture the effectiveness of TikTokâs algorithm that recommends content to users. On âstandardâ accounts, content about suicide followed within nearly three minutes and eating disorder material was shown within eight minutes. âThe results are every parentâs nightmare,â said Imran Ahmed, CCDHâs chief executive. âYoung peopleâs feeds are bombarded with harmful, harrowing content that can have a significant cumulative impact on their understanding of the world around them, and their physical and mental health.â The group said the majority of mental health videos presented to its standard accounts via the For You feed â the main way TikTok users experience the app â consisted of users sharing their anxieties and insecurities. Body image content was more harmful, the report said, with accounts registered for 13-year-olds being shown videos advertising weight loss drinks and âtummy-tuckâ surgery. One animation that appeared in front of the standard accounts carried a piece of audio stating âIâve been starving myself for youâ and had more than 100,000 likes. The report said the accounts were shown self-harm or eating disorder videos every 206 seconds. The researchers found that videos relating to body image, mental health and eating disorders were shown to âvulnerableâ accounts three times more than to standard accounts. The vulnerable accounts received 12 times as many recommendations for self-harm and suicide-related videos as the standard accounts, the report said. The recommended content was more extreme for the vulnerable accounts, including methods of self-harm and young people discussing plans to kill themselves. CCDH said a mental health or body image-related video was shown every 27 seconds, although the content was dominated by mental health videos, which CCDH defined as videos about anxieties, insecurities and mental health conditions, excluding eating disorders, self-harm and suicide. The group said its research did not differentiate between content with a positive intent â such as content discovering recovery â or negative content. A spokesperson for TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese firm ByteDance and has more than 1 billion users worldwide, said the CCDH study did not reflect the experience or viewing habits of real-life users of the app. âWe regularly consult with health experts, remove violations of our policies and provide access to supportive resources for anyone in need,â they said. âWeâre mindful that triggering content is unique to each individual and remain focused on fostering a safe and comfortable space for everyone, including people who choose to share their recovery journeys or educate others on these important topics.â TikTokâs guidelines ban content that promotes behaviour that could lead to suicide and self-harm, as well as material that promotes unhealthy eating behaviours or habits. The UKâs online safety bill proposes requiring social networks to take action against so-called âlegal but harmfulâ content being shown to children. A DCMS spokesperson said âWe are putting a stop to unregulated social media causing harm to our children. Under the Online Safety Bill, tech platforms will need to prevent under-18s from being exposed to illegal content assisting suicide and protect them from other harmful or age-inappropriate material, including the promotion of self-harm and eating disorders, or face huge fines.â â¢ In the UK, the youth suicide charity Papyrus can be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or email pat@papyrus-uk.org.

The low-priced toys, with over 3,000 designs, have seen a 300% increase in UK sales this year, with a total of 200 million sold worldwide. Their success is attributed to the power of social media, as fans share their collections online. Squishmallows appeal to consumers through trends like wellness and collecting, providing comfort and sensory appeal. Plans are underway to expand the brand into new product areas.


","Times are tough and budgets are squeezed, so it is perhaps no surprise that the runaway success story in Toyland this Christmas is Squishmallows, the squidgy, huggable pillows-with-a-face that became a viral sensation on TikTok. The Â£8 toys are flying off retailersâ shelves with UK sales up 300% this year and stores on track to sell 4m. This pattern is being repeated around the world as total Squishmallows sales doubled in less than a year to surpass 200m this summer â a success story that FrÃ©dÃ©rique Tutt, toy expert at market researchers NPD, said reflected the staggering âpower of social mediaâ. For the uninitiated, Squishmallows are a line of whimsical, stuffed creatures. They can be fruit, vegetable or animal or, in keeping with this quirky world, a hybrid â think pug dressed as watermelon or penguin in a pineapple costume. They rose to prominence on social media as fans â the toys are particularly popular with teenage girls â shared their collections online, resulting in more than 9bn video views on TikTok alone. This was aided by famous devotees such as Kim Kardashian, Lady Gaga and the US social media star Charli DâAmelio posting about the toys to their huge numbers of followers. Tutt said Squishmallows united several big consumer trends including wellness and collecting. âIt is a bit of âcuddlesâ,â she said of the sensory appeal of the supersoft, cushionlike toys. âPeople are also collecting more than ever, we see that in our data with things like PokÃ©mon and Panini stickers. Pull those things together and add the power of social media, and Squishmallows became a viral sensation.â Launched in 2017, there are now 3,000 Squishmallow designs, each with a unique name and biography, a facet that stokes their appeal for collectors who seek out characters they relate to. For example Cam the Cat, one the US brandâs first characters, likes skateboarding, the beach and cat naps. Gerhard Runken, the senior vice-president of brand and marketing at Jazwares, which owns Squishmallows, said the low-priced toys struck a chord during the Covid era when people were spending more time at home and needed a âlittle hug or something soft to play withâ. The toys are popular with children and adults who relate to them in different ways, he said. âSquishmallows are fun to have around the house, you can collect them, theyâre fun to sleep with, lay on, and share,â said Runken of the toys, which range in size from 18cm to 50cm, with the largest ones selling for Â£50 to Â£60. âWhile we donât say in our brand statement that we are a mental health pillow, we embrace how they help people.â One of the most appealing things about the toys is how they feel, he said. They are covered in a special stretchy fabric while the filling, which utilises recycled plastic bottles, feels like a marshmallow. âWe process it more than other peopleâs fillings and it really gives us that cloud-type feel,â explained Runken. Even the legendary investor Warren Buffett is a collector, in a sense. His Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate recently bought the investment company that owns Jazwares. The Squishmallows brand has big plans for the future as it moves beyond toys into new product areas such as clothing, bedding and stationery. The Entertainer toy chain said it would sell 1m of the toys this year. âSquishmallows has been phenomenal,â said its founder, Gary Grant. âYou see people touching, pulling and stretching them. It is not just any soft toy, it is very cuddly and tactile. âThe other thing that weâve noticed is the age group appeal is much wider than children. Where weâve got shops in university towns and cities, weâve had university students buying them.

90,"Pop songs with bridges, once a staple in the genre, are becoming less common, raising concerns among artists and fans. TikTok, streaming services, and algorithms are cited as factors contributing to this shift. Shorter song lengths and the desire for repetition may explain the trend. However, bridges still have potential to stand out and engage listeners. Music is evolving, and while bridges may be evolving or taking new forms, their absence doesn't necessarily diminish the quality of music","Back in March, the Australian singer Hatchie tweeted: âWhy are pop songs with a bridge a dying breed?â She wasnât the only one pondering that question; it was a sentiment that would be echoed in a post by the TikTok musician Boy Jr in August, who â to the tune of Video Killed the Radio Star â told her 300,000 followers that the very platform she was posting from had, along with streaming services and algorithms, âkilled the bridge in pop songsâ. In another TikTok post that garnered 100,000 likes in November, user, R00keries wrote âshoutout to every artist that still writes bridges in their songs â¦ theyâre the best part and I hate that theyâre going awayâ. Indeed, if you have listened to pop music at all in the past few years, you may have noticed that something is missing. The bridge â that part of the song where verse and chorus give way to an alternate section that ramps up the tension (or the fun) â is seemingly on the wane. Where a big, barnstorming section â perhaps complete with an epic key change, a la CÃ©line Dionâs My Heart Will Go On or, er, Avril Lavigneâs Sk8er Boi â may have once been de rigueur, these days you often just get another verse or a moody final chorus. Bridge-free hits of recent years have included the country-inspired smash Old Town Road by Lil Nas X, Gayleâs pop-punk breakout single ABCDEFU, and Harry Stylesâs Late Night Talking, whose muzak-y R&amp;B sound largely loops for its three-minute running time. Of all of the UK No 1 singles in 2022, only a handful have a definitive bridge â among them Kate Bushâs 1985 hit Running Up That Hill, which found viral success again thanks to Stranger Things. On his heartstring-tugging single Forget Me, Lewis Capaldi offers a redo of the chorus, and even Taylor Swift â often acclaimed as the contemporary queen of the bridge by pop fans (and Time magazine), for tracks such as All Too Well and Cruel Summer â opted for a third verse on her No 1 single Anti-Hero, rather than going into full-on key-change mode. It is a trend that hasnât gone unnoticed by those in the know, with none other than Sting calling out the seeming dearth of bridges in a 2021 interview with the music producer and YouTuber Rick Beato. âThe structure is slightly simpler now â¦ itâs more minimalist,â he said. âThe bridge has disappeared. For me, the bridge is therapy â¦ the structure is therapy. In modern music, most of it, youâre in a circular trap â¦ Youâre not getting that release.â But is the bridge actually disappearing, and is TikTok â with its short, meme-heavy format â to blame? Twenty-year-old Caity Baser is a singer-songwriter from Southampton who started uploading her music to the social media app during lockdown, inspired by the likes of Kate Nash, Rizzle Kicks and her own dating dramas, and has since gone on to sign with EMI. âI was really stressed about going to uni, and having no money,â she says. âSo I wrote a song about it [Average Student]. I almost deleted it, but then I turned my phone back on and it had half a million views â¦â For Baser, it is unlikely that artists are specifically ditching bridges to appeal to the siteâs users (âI wonât not put a bridge in because Iâm like: âOh, TikTok wonât like it.â I love a bridgeâ), but rather that pop songs themselves are getting shorter, leading artists to be more concise. âI think [shorter songs] are a bit of a clever thing,â she says. âYou want to hear them again; you want to play them again.â It is a sentiment shared by Sophia Ikirmawi, a London-based music publicist. âSongs are definitely shorter but itâs not just for TikTok, itâs for streaming,â she says. âIf you have an album full of shorter songs, people can play through the album more quickly, and your sales will go up.â It is difficult to know exactly which parts of a song might go viral on an app such as TikTok which, in turn, could tempt artists to adopt more repetitive song structures, but Ikirmawi warns against generalisations. âI donât know how much people are thinking about TikTok,â she says. âItâs difficult to know what will go viral. Look at how random songs like an Abba track or [Thatâs Not My Name by] the Ting Tings can blow up on there â¦ youâd be foolish to change a song just to try and go viral.â Ikirmawi cites Harry Stylesâs As It Was, for example â with its âLeave Americaâ line which crowds screamed at the singer on tour as an unsubtle protest against him spending so much of his time in the US â as proof that the bridge still has potential to jostle out a singalong chorus for attention. Olivia Rodrigoâs Drivers License, released in 2021, is another example that goes against the grain, with its âRed lights / Stop signsâ crescendo arguably the most memorable part of the song. âThereâs a generation of pop singers who have grown up with Taylor Swift, and are obsessed with [her sound],â says Ikirmawi of Rodrigo and contemporaries such as Maisie Peters and Griff, both of whom are also partial to a bridge. For Charlie Harding, co-host of the Vulture podcast Switched on Pop, the âbridge or no bridgeâ question is inextricably linked with the evolution of music itself. âSong form in general is changing,â he says. âPeople are experimenting more and more. Bridges go back to classical pop, when you had to give the listener some kind of reprieve to earn your final section. There are probably a few reasons why people donât feel compelled to write a bridge today. One of those is certainly a long disconnect from classical pop, and songs have been getting shorter for a long time.â Harding adds that the ubiquity of software-made music based around eight- to 16-bar loops can make a bridge âdifficult to write, because youâve built your whole song around this loop, and now you need to generate completely new material. Frankly it might be too much of a deviation.â Besides, who is to say what a bridge is now anyway? For Harding, Swiftâs third Anti-Hero verse fulfils the same brief of dipping the energy before a final build up, even if it sounds more like a verse or a âdown chorusâ (the stripped-back, energy-free version of a refrain you hear just before a triumphant finale). He does, however, reject the idea that music is becoming simpler overall. While there may be âmore things that stay in commonâ throughout a song, in the form of chord loops, Harding sees it as âleaning into a different musical language â¦ Today you have layers upon layers of unique sounds that can make a four-bar chord loop really interesting, with new things constantly happening. Iâm very hesitant to say that things have become simpler or weâve become dumber; itâs just that different things are taking precedence.â It seems, ultimately, that bridges are not going away for good but merely evolving, or taking on new forms in the age of streaming and social media virality. And, even if you may be hearing fewer of them right now, that doesnât mean that music is necessarily worse for it. âLook at Jolene by Dolly Parton,â says Baser. âNo bridge â and itâs a smash. Thereâs no right or wrong.â",Guardian,9/12/2022,Is TikTok killing off the pop music bridge?,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/09/pop-music-is-tiktok-killing-the-bridge
91,"Governor Greg Abbott of Texas has ordered state agencies to ban TikTok on government-issued devices due to security concerns. The order cites TikTok's data-sharing practices with the Chinese government and the potential access China-based employees have to US user data. Other Republican lawmakers in different states have implemented similar bans, with Indiana's attorney general even suing TikTok for misleading users about content and data security. TikTok has responded, stating that the bans are fueled by misinformation and expressing disappointment at being cut off from government agencies.","Governor Greg Abbott of Texas on Wednesday ordered state agencies to ban TikTok on government-issued devices, citing security concerns of the appâs data-sharing practices with the Chinese government. âTikTok harvests vast amounts of data from its usersâ devices â including when, where and how they conduct Internet activity â and offers this trove of potentially sensitive information to the Chinese government,â according to one of the letters the governor sent to state agency leaders. âWhile TikTok has claimed that it stores US data within the US, the company admitted in a letter to Congress that China-based employees can have access to US data. It has also been reported that ByteDance planned to use TikTok location information to surveil individual American citizens,â it added. The letter also cited Chinaâs 2017 National Intelligence Law, stating that businesses are required to assist China in intelligence work including data sharing. It recounted that TikTokâs algorithm had already censored topics politically sensitive to the Chinese Communist party, including the Tiananmen Square protests. Several other Republican lawmakers across the country have implemented similar TikTok bans. Indianaâs attorney general went a step further and sued the social media app, claiming the video-sharing platform misleads its users, particularly children, about the level of inappropriate content and security of consumer information. Todd Rokita claimed in the complaint filed on Wednesday that while TikTok says it is safe for users 13 years and older, the app contains âsalacious and inappropriate contentâ available to young users âfor unlimited periods of time, day and night, in an effort to line TikTokâs pockets with billions of dollars from US consumersâ. As part of Abbottâs order, state agency leaders are required to immediately ban its employees from downloading and using the app on any government-issued device including cellphones, laptops, tablets, desktop computers and âother devices capable of Internet connectivityâ. In addition, Abbott announced a direct joint action by the stateâs department of public safety and department of information resources to address the appâs âvulnerabilitiesâ on personal devices by 15 January 2023. Every state agency will then be given a month to set its own policy regarding the use of the app on employeesâ personal devices. Abbottâs order follows in the footsteps of Marylandâs governor, Larry Hogan, who on Tuesday also ordered the ban of Tiktok and several other China and Russia-based platforms in the stateâs executive government branch. âThere may be no greater threat to our personal safety and our national security than the cyber vulnerabilities that support our daily lives,â Hogan, a Republican, said in a statement, adding: âTo further protect our systems, we are issuing this emergency directive against foreign actors and organizations that seek to weaken and divide us.â Similarly, Wisconsinâs Republican representatives in Congress on Tuesday called on Governor Tony Evers to delete TikTok from all state government devices, calling it a national security threat. âWisconsinites expect their governor to be aware of the dangerous national security threats TikTok poses and to protect them from this avenue for CCP intelligence operations,â said Senator Ron Johnson and the representatives Mike Gallagher, Tom Tiffany, Glenn Grothman, Bryan Steil and Scott Fitzgerald said in a letter. The Maryland directive comes a week after South Dakotaâs governor, Kristi Noem, also a Republican, banned state employees and contractors from accessing TikTok on state-owned devices, citing its ties to China. Similarly, the South Carolina governor, Henry McMaster, on Monday asked the stateâs department of administration to ban TikTok from all state government devices it manages. Nebraskaâs governor, Pete Ricketts, blocked TikTok on state electronic devices in August 2020. In response, TikTok said that the recent slew of bans âare largely fueled by misinformation about our companyâ. âWe are always happy to meet with state policymakers to discuss our privacy and security practices,â TikTok spokesperson Jamal Brown told the Associated Press. âWe are disappointed that the many state agencies, offices, and universities that have been using TikTok to build communities and connect with constituents will no longer have access to our platform.â",Guardian,8/12/2022,Texas bans TikTok on government devices amid China data-sharing fears,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/07/texas-bans-tiktok-government-devices-china-data-sharing-fears
92,"The Treasury's review of the news media bargaining code in Australia recommends assessing social media platforms like TikTok and Twitter for potential payments to news companies for their content. The code has already facilitated agreements between Google, Meta (owner of Facebook and Instagram), and news publishers. However, other platforms have not been included, and the report suggests periodic inquiries by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to determine their inclusion. Media companies advocate expanding the code to cover platforms like TikTok, while Google and Meta have existing agreements with news publishers.","Social media sites like TikTok and Twitter could be assessed for whether they should pay news companies for content, under recommendations from the Treasuryâs review of the news media bargaining code. In its first year of operation, the code was a success, facilitating 23 agreements between Google and news publishers, and 13 agreements between Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, and news publishers, according to a Treasury report released on Thursday. Andrew Forrestâs Minderoo Foundation also helped negotiate an agreement with the platforms representing 24 publishers in May this year. Publishers including Guardian Australia and Nine said that in the absence of the code, there would not have been meaningful licensing negotiations with the platforms. The ABC said it used the funding to appoint 57 regional positions, including reporters in 19 locations, 10 of which did not previously have them. Under the code implemented by the former Coalition government, the treasurer can designate a digital platformâs involvement and that would bring on strict rules around negotiations with news publishers. So far no digital platform has been designated â the Morrison government was able to leverage the threat of the code being applied to bring Meta and Google to the table. But this has meant some news publications have not been able to negotiate with the companies and other digital platforms such as TikTok and Twitter have not been included. Treasury recommended the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) conduct periodic inquiries into what other platforms should be included. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Media companies have already suggested expanding the code. In a submission to an ACCC review of social media, Nine said TikTok had a ârapidly growing and unfair market powerâ and was an âunavoidable business partnerâ for news in Australia, meaning it should be covered by the code. The report noted that some of the clauses in existing agreements would end the contracts should the digital platforms be designated under the code, meaning the news companies would not receive whatever outstanding funding had yet to be paid. Googleâs director of government affairs and public policy, Lucinda Longcroft, said Googleâs contribution to the news industry in Australia now covered 70 Australian news businesses, representing 200 mastheads, the majority of which were local or regional. Many of Googleâs agreements run for five years, while all of Metaâs agreements run for three years. The shorter run for Metaâs agreements raises questions about whether the company will come to the table with a new agreement when the deals expire. Meta cut a number of roles from its Australian news team as part of a global restructure last month that saw 11,000 people leave the company. The company had already indicated its plan to end in-house curation of Facebook news in Australia by 2021. Meta declined to comment on the Treasury report, but in a response to the cuts announcement last month, its Australia and New Zealand managing director, Will Easton, indicated the companyâs focus had shifted. âWhile we have maintained news partnerships resources in Australia, user preferences have shifted to creator-driven content in products such as Watch and Reels, and this is where we will focus moving forward.â The Treasury report has recommended a review of the code after four years of operation. The Public Interest Journalism Initiative criticised this proposal, however, saying it would be after many of the deals have expired. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, and the assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, said they would consider the recommendations of the report. Jones said the platforms âmust continue to negotiate in good faith with news businesses to ensure they are fairly remunerated for the news content they createâ.",Guardian,2/12/2022,Twitter and TikTok could be called to negotiate under Australiaâs news media code,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/02/twitter-and-tiktok-could-be-called-to-negotiate-under-australias-news-media-code

","Have we recovered from the victory hangover? There were iconic scenes at Melbourneâs Federation Square, prompting envy in the harbour city where no such live site exists. That will be remedied for this Sundayâs Socceroos clash with Argentina, with the New South Wales government announcing it will set up a live site in the Sydney CBD â specific location TBD. The victory was a heartfelt tale for player Bailey Wright, who shortly after leaving the field received a text from his wife about the condition of his seriously ill mother-in-law. âIâve just come in from a message from my wife,â Wright said. âI just want to dedicate this to my wife â bless her â and her mum. Iâll be honest, Iâm not sure if sheâs still with us.â Top news Christine McVie dies | The voice behind Fleetwood Mac classics including Everywhere and Donât Stop has âpassed away peacefullyâ following a short illness. She was 79 years old. Tributes have flowed from across the music industry, with sometimes fellow band member and Crowded House frontman, Neil Finn, calling McVie a âsupremely gifted songwriter and a warm and wonderful friendâ. Concussion in sport | An inquiry proposed by the Greens with Labor and Coalition support will examine concussion and repeated head trauma in contact sports at all levels, for all genders and age groups. It comes amid growing concern about chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a disease which former AFL concussion doctor Paul McCrory has been accused of downplaying the risks of. Medibank hackerâs data dump | The cyber-criminals behind the Medibank hack have declared âcase closedâ after posting a file on the dark web that looks to be the remainder of the customer data they acquired.

In September, Melanoma Institute Australia co-medical directors, Prof Georgina Long and Prof Richard Scolyer, took issue with the app for its popular #sunburnchallenge hashtag. Emissions target falling short | Australia is on track for a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030, short of the 43% target set by the Albanese government. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said the projection is still an improvement on the Morrison government, when projections âwere at only 30%â. âThat is, weâve lifted the outlook by a third in just our first six months,â Bowen said. US railroad strike | The House of Representatives voted to approve a bill to block a railroad strike, after president Joe Biden called on Congress to intervene, warning the strike would âdevastate our economyâ. The sticking point is a demand for sick pay, which is not provided to workers. Progressive pushback in support of worker demands resulted in a second House vote to mandate sick pay, but itâs unclear whether that will pass the Senate. China economy worries | As well as prompting social unrest, there are signs Chinaâs zero-Covid strategy is throttling the worldâs second largest economy. Chinaâs GDP is forecast to grow by 3.2% this year, well below the official target of 5.5%.

94,"TikTok will ban tanning videos and promote sun safety education after concerns were raised by Australian medical experts. The platform faced criticism for its popular #sunburnchallenge hashtag, which glamorized tanning. TikTok will implement pop-up banners against tanning content, remove concerning material, and promote user-generated content about sun safety and melanoma dangers. Melanoma is the most common cancer among 20 to 39-year-olds in Australia. The move has been welcomed by health professionals who aim to discourage tanning and reduce skin cancer risks.","Social media giant TikTok has announced it will actively ban videos that encourage tanning and add educational content to its platform after alarm from Australian medical experts over the platformâs sharing of pro-tanning material. In September, Melanoma Institute Australia co-medical directors Prof Georgina Long and Prof Richard Scolyer, speaking at the National Press Club, took issue with the video-sharing app for its popular #sunburnchallenge hashtag. Speaking alongside Olympian and melanoma survivor Cate Campbell, Long warned social media influencers were glamorising tanning with hashtags like âsunburnt tanlinesâ, which had more than 200m views. She urged platforms, television stations and influencers to âchange the cultural narrative around sunburn and tanningâ in Australia, which, alongside New Zealand, has the highest skin cancer incidence and mortality rate in the world. In response to the backlash, TikTok has announced a widespread education campaign that will impose a pop-up banner for an anti-tanning content â and for all searches around tanning, summer and sunburn. The campaign, targeting people between 20 and 39, will also remove âconcerning contentâ related to âdangerousâ tanning activities, including the popular #sunburnchallenge hashtag, which has more than 8.4m views worldwide. The TikTok trend encourages users to post videos of their most painful, blistering sunburns, âawkward tan-linesâ and peeling skin for dramatic effect, with tips on reducing the severity of a burn. TikTokâs general manager in Australia and New Zealand, Lee Hunter, said the platform would encourage user-generated content about sun safety and the dangers of melanoma among young people. Melanoma is the most common form of cancer among 20 to 39-year-olds in Australia and the nationâs most deadly form of skin cancer, accounting for more than 1,000 deaths a year. Cancer Australia estimates 17,756 new cases of melanoma of the skin will be diagnosed in 2022, making it the third most common cancer nationwide behind prostate cancer and breast cancer. âWeâll actively promote the creator content related to the campaign, which means everyone aged between 20 and 39 will see the message,â Hunter said. âAnd everyone who searches for a hashtag related to summer sun, tanning and many other summer time phrases will see the â¦ banner and will be provided with information that outlines the dangers of tanning.â The platformâs first video features youthful Australian influencer âstarrâ lathering sunscreen on a beach and dismissing tanning to her alter ego as âcookedâ. The Melanoma Institute Australia chief executive, Matthew Browne, said it had been lobbying the social media platform for months to curb concerning content on its platform, which could influence young and susceptible social media users. Thirty-two per cent 32% of the platformâs users are between 16 and 24. âOur medical directors put out a plea about the urgent need to stop the glamorisation of tanning, to save young lives, and we are delighted TikTok answered that call,â Browne said. âOne Aussie is diagnosed with melanoma every 30 minutes and it claims more lives than the national road toll. Tanning is actually skin cells in trauma. âThere is no safe way of sun tanning, including the concept of getting a protective âbase tanâ at the start of summer.â The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president, Dr Nicole Higgins, said it was a âsmart moveâ from TikTok amid the ongoing popularity for tanning among young people. âWe are having enough difficulty discouraging patients, particularly young people, from tanning themselves and risking skin cancer without social media platforms making that job even harder,â she said. âWe have the highest rates of skin cancer in the entire world, with more than 12,000 invasive melanoma diagnoses every single year. âI cut melanomas out of people very regularly, including young people â¦ What may seem glamorous or appealing can actually be deadly.â TikTok has faced backlash in the past over viral challenges, including the âblackout challengeâ where users to choked themselves until they passed out, and the âBenadryl challengeâ, encouraging large intakes of antihistamines in an attempt to produce hallucinogenic effects.",Guardian,1/12/2022,TikTok to ban videos that encourage sunburn and tanning after alarm from medical experts,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/01/tiktok-to-ban-videos-that-encourage-sunburn-and-tanning-after-alarm-from-medical-experts
95,"Matt Hancock, former UK Health Secretary, has surprisingly made it to the final of ""I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!"" despite initial backlash. Public relations experts attribute his success to support from young TikTok users, who were mobilized by his PR team to vote for him repeatedly. Hancock's TikTok account gained over 77,000 followers and his videos have been viewed 400 million times. Critics argue that his popularity among younger audiences will not redeem his tarnished political career.


","When Matt Hancock entered the Iâm a Celebrity â¦ Get Me Out of Here! jungle, pundits predicted he would be the first to be voted out. His decision to appear on the ITV show, despite his record during the pandemic and the fact he is a sitting MP, had provoked anger and disgust. More than 1,700 people complained to Ofcom, the broadcast regulator, and the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group issued a searing statement. âThe fact that he is trying to cash in on his terrible legacy, rather than showing some humility or seeking to reflect on the appalling consequences of his time in government, says it all about the sort of person he is,â a spokesperson said. But despite the criticism â or perhaps because of it â the former health secretary has won the backing of an unlikely crowd, lasting more than two weeks in the jungle and surviving eight eliminations to make it to the final today. Support from young TikTok users â boosted by a concerted effort from his PR team â appears to have been key to his on-screen success, according to public relations experts and political rivals. Over the past few days, before the final on ITV on Sunday evening, members of Hancockâs PR team were lobbying for votes on the app â encouraging people to vote for him repeatedly and giving them step-by-step instructions. One video, addressed to âteam Mattâ, said their mission was to âkeep Matt in the jungleâ. It added that they should âdownload the Iâm a Celebrity... app and vote five times,â or call the voting number. âAlways use all my votes to keep Matt in!â one TikTokker wrote in response. Another video was billed as a âstep by step guide to keep Matt in the jungleâ and showed someone scrolling through the app on their phone and voting for Hancock repeatedly. The TikTok campaign is not a breach of the rules: ITVâs website says viewers can vote up to five times each via the app, while those voting by text or phone can vote up to 600 times from a single number before it is deemed suspicious and unfair to the other contestants. But it is a deliberate strategy. Since 8 November, Hancockâs PR team has posted 24 videos of him on the app, all linked to his appearance in the jungle. He now has more than 77,000 followers and at least 511,800 likes across his official TikTok account, while videos of him overall have been watched 400 million times, according to TikTokâs internal data. Aside from Hollyoaks actor Owen Warner, the equivalent stats for other stars are far poorer. Former rugby player Mike Tindall, who was voted out last night, has less than 3,500 followers, with just over 26,000 likes, while what appears to be the official account for former England footballer Jill Scott, who was tipped as the favourite to win going into the final tonight, has about 2,180 followers and less than 900 likes. On Twitter and Instagram, the other Iâm a Celebrity... contestants admittedly have a bigger presence. But it is TikTok â where videos have been promoted by the algorithm and hashtags such as #matthancockfanclub have gained traction â that has been so crucial for Hancock, said PR guru Mark Borkowski. âI think TikTok has been quite important to him. I think [users] see him as some sort of anomaly, something that is winding up the older generation, so why donât we just play mischief?â Borkowski said. He added: âThe people instructing him back in Blighty have done a very good job with TikTok. A lot of it is instructing the audience what to do, to use the app, how to vote for Matt. And that bit has been clever.â But software used by Borkowskiâs team to track media coverage shows comments on articles and social media posts about Hancock, 44, are still largely negative. During his time as health secretary, the MP for West Suffolk oversaw the unlawful discharge of hospital patients into care homes at the height of the pandemic and broke transparency rules by failing to publish details of multibillion-pound government PPE contracts. He was subsequently forced to resign as health secretary after the Sun published footage of him kissing his aide Gina Coladangelo while social distancing rules were in place. While Borkowksi believes that the publicâs view of Hancock remains dim, he says younger fans could help him win. He does not believe it will pay off, however. âI donât think he has a political career after it. I think heâll be ridiculed,â Borkowksi said. âHeâs like a pantomime villain. I can see him doing odd advertising campaigns.â Ian Houlder, a Conservative councillor in Hancockâs West Suffolk seat, was equally scathing. He too believes Hancockâs success on the programme is down to younger audiences. âI think itâs down to demographics; itâs the Corbyn effect,â said Houlder, 73. He wants Hancock to resign but fears his TV stint will embolden him in future, and called on the local Conservative association to hold a membership vote on deselecting him. âWhat I hope is that he doesnât come back thinking: âIâm the most famous person in England and Iâm going to carry on as MP.â Iâll go absolutely spare. Itâs awful that he thinks he can just walk away from his constituency,â he said. Jo Hemmings, a behavioural and media psychologist, was more positive in her assessment. She said Hancock had defied expectations on the show by getting to the final and coming across as âsomeone who has more human qualities than perhaps they anticipated and as not such a bad guy after allâ. She admits to being baffled by the sea change in public opinion â from him being seen as the face of pandemic mishandling, rule-breaking and death to being viewed as likable campmate - and believes it will have upended producersâ expectations. âThey were playing with peopleâs minds by putting him in there. He clearly isnât perceived as a villain of the piece. I think he was put in to fulfil that role,â she said. âHe went in there to be laughed at, humiliated, punished and actually he has done well,â she added. âHeâs getting out of it what he intended to get out of it.â Hancockâs team said he had been âworking on constituency mattersâ in the jungle, adding that the programmeâsâproducers have agreed that Matt can communicate with his team if thereâs an urgent constituency matter while heâs on the showâ.âAs soon as Mattâs time in camp is up, he will return to Suffolk to hold surgeries where he will catch up with his constituents and discuss matters of concern,â a spokesperson said.

96,"Malaysia is holding a closely contested general election with a record number of young voters after the voting age was lowered to 18. Politicians have targeted the youth through Instagram and TikTok to secure their support. Concerns over voter turnout arise due to political infighting and recent flooding. The three main coalitions, including the ruling Barisan Nasional, are vying for power, but analysts predict there may not be a clear majority. Economic stability and addressing youth issues such as jobs and education are key campaign promises.","Malaysians are voting in a tightly contested general election on Saturday, after two weeks of fierce campaigning in which politicians have sought to woo millions of young voters by embracing Instagram and TikTok trends. Saturdayâs election is the first since constitutional changes lowered the voting age to 18 and automatically registered voters, meaning there are 6 million more voters than at the previous election in 2018. It is believed to be the first time people under 40 make up the majority of the electorate. More than 9,000 polling centres will open for 10 hours on Saturday but there is concern about voter turnout. On top of widespread flooding and forecasts of further rain, many voters are weary after years of political infighting. The government that won power in 2018 collapsed in less than two years, and the country has had three different prime ministers in four years. The current prime minister, Ismail Sabri Yaakob, of the UMNO party, called the snap election in October in an attempt to strengthen his Barisan Nasional (National Front) alliance. He is up against two other coalitions vying to form a government: Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope), led by the reformist opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, and Perikatan Nasional (National Alliance), led by the former prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin. UMNO had dominated Malaysian politics for decades, before it was ousted in the 2018 elections â a result driven by popular anger over the multibillion-dollar 1MDB financial scandal. Najib Razak, a former prime minister, was imprisoned recently for 12 years on charges related to 1MDB. Analysts say it is unlikely there will be a clear majority â which requires a minimum 112 of 222 parliamentary seats â after Saturdayâs vote. âThe question will be which coalition will have the bigger number of seats with a strong negotiating position,â said Dr Azmil Tayeb, a political analyst. A new battleground In the battle to win over first-time voters, politicians have embraced social media, with TikTok emerging as a new battleground in the race to secure youth votes. There are now 1.4 million 18- to 21-year-olds who are newly eligible to vote, out of a total voting population of 21.1 million. Muhyiddin Yassin, 75, the chair of Perikatan Nasional (PN), is among those to have tapped into TikTok trends during campaigning. In one video that has been liked hundreds of thousands of times, he swipes away the logos of rival political coalitions to the strains of the song Swipe by the Singaporean hip-hop artist Alyph. Syed Saddiq, who became Malaysiaâs youngest minister after the 2018 elections, is especially active on social media, posting clips of campaign speeches, pleas for young people to vote â as well as clips of his two cats. In one video, he does 60 seconds of press-ups (the time it takes to register for postal voting) to persuade people how quick the process is. Divya Latha Ramesh, 23, a student and first-time voter, said that in the run-up to the election her social media feeds had been saturated with politics. âRecently all my fyp [For You page] recommendations are about politics,â she said. âSocial media is a huge platform to attract young votersâ attention.â Divya Latha wants a government that will bring about a more equal society, reduce poverty and put an end to affirmative action policies that have for decades benefited the Malay majority over ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities in areas such as education. âI hope for a government that cares about its own people regardless of their race, age and skin colour,â she said. Raja Nur Arissa, 21, also voting for the first time, said while she had some friends who supported UMNO, young people were more likely to be conscious of the 1MDB scandal. âThere are not many from the younger generation that still support [Najib],â she said. Arissa, a student and a social media influencer, said she wanted a government that cared about human rights, and that would take weather-related disasters seriously. Some of her friends were affected during recent flooding, not once but twice, due to failures of the government warning system, she said. She hopes that, soon, younger leaders could also emerge. âAlthough they say experience makes a great leader, we should also give a chance to the younger ones to prove that the next generation can be better. Many youth now are struggling to make a living.â Azmil, the analyst, said that on social media the three major coalitions had focused on promising stability and economic prosperity. âEspecially for young peopleâs jobs, high cost of living, student debt, access to education, these are the typical promises. It resonates a bit more now as we have a global recession.â On the brink of power Anwar Ibrahim, the opposition leader and former deputy prime minister, has drawn huge turnouts at his events, according to Azmi Hassan, a senior fellow at Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research (NASR). But he said the atmosphere was more subdued than in 2018, when Anwarâs coalition benefited from huge public anger over the 1MDB scandal. Anwar has promised reforms such as limiting the prime ministerâs term to 10 years, and making assistance needs-based rather that race-based. He has been on the brink of power several times during his turbulent political career . It was Anwarâs reformist coalition â an unlikely alliance formed with his former rival Mahathir Mohamad â that defeated Barisan Nasional in 2018. Mahathir had promised Anwar he would succeed him as prime minister, but he resigned from office before the promise could be fulfilled. Dr Oh Ei Sun, a political analyst and a senior fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, said loyalty among UMNO voters should not be underestimated this year. âI think a party such as UMNO has the ability, an uncanny ability, to mobilise their voters to still come out to vote, therefore flooding would benefit UMNO,â said Ei Sun.",Guardian,18/11/2022,Malaysiaâs TikTok election: under-21s head to polls for first time,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/18/under-21s-given-vote-as-malaysia-goes-to-polls-in-tiktok-election
97,"TikTok has partnered with publishers and retailers, including HarperCollins UK, WH Smith, Bloomsbury, and bookshop.org, to sell books directly through its online marketplace. The move comes as #BookTok gains popularity, with over 90 billion views on book-related content. Users can now purchase books within the app, expanding TikTok's existing marketplace offerings. While some users appreciate the accessibility and immediate purchase options, concerns have been raised about commercialization and the lack of diversity in book selections.


","TikTok has proved to be a hugely successful way to promote books in recent years, with publishers attributing the popularity of books such as It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover and The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid in large part to recommendations on the app. Now TikTok has decided to sell books directly, announcing partnerships with publishers HarperCollins UK, WH Smith, Bloomsbury and bookshop.org, all of which will sell books via TikTokâs online marketplace. #BookTok is one of the social media platformâs most popular hashtags, reaching more than 90bn views to date, and as a result TikTok has formed several partnerships off the back of its success, including with the Hay festival and publisher Penguin Random House (PRH), where since September, app users have been able to tag any PRH title in their videos. However, these new partnerships mark the first time users have been able to buy books directly through TikTok. Any merchant signed up to TikTok Shop can advertise and sell products to users within the app. The marketplace has been gradually expanding to include fashion, consumer electronics, beauty and fresh and frozen goods â and now books. TikTok Shopâs senior director of e-commerce Patrick Nommensen, said: âIt has been incredible to witness the BookTok community sharing its passion for reading, and reshaping the publishing world in the process.â He added: âWith these new partnerships, weâre delighted to be making it even easier for book lovers to buy the latest BookTok recommendations without ever leaving the platform, while also providing new avenues for publishers both large and small to reach their audiences.â He also suggested that future publisher partnerships may be on the horizon, adding that he and his colleagues âlook forward to welcoming more merchants on to TikTok Shop UK in the future, as our platform continues to evolve as the ultimate destination for books and literature.â Jo Surman, group digital and technology director at HarperCollins UK, said: âWeâve really enjoyed the last year working with TikTok and our authors to create content engaging with the thriving TikTok community.â Selling books through the app was âthe natural next stepâ, she said. Meanwhile, Nicole Vanderbilt, managing director at bookshop.org, said: âWeâre pleased to be partnering with TikTok Shop â not only to give BookTokers and their communities another way to buy from their local independent through bookshop.org, but also to help booksellers enhance their own BookTok skills.â The increased commercialisation of BookTok hasnât always been received positively by TikTok users, however. When a TikTok book club was launched earlier this year, app user TheLibbyRuth said: âWhile I enjoy content created by businesses, I think the best part about TikTok is the authentic and unpolished aspect of it, and I would hate to see it become overly commercialised, especially with the lack of diversity in publishing.â BookToker zai_rambles, who focuses on books by and about Black people, said the shop was a good thing, but needs to be developed further. âOf course itâs making books a lot more accessible for people more casually on BookTok,â she said. âPeople donât only save the videos, now they can see the video and buy [the book] immediately which I think is definitely going to encourage people to read more.â The shop, however, is ânot varied enoughâ, she thinks. âIt is quite limited and there are very popular books there, yes, but Iâm finding that most of the books that I recommend or that I want to read are not on TikTok bookshop.â What makes BookTok âso beautifulâ, she believes, âis the fact that you can find so many different kinds of genres and stories.â The TikTok bookshop âneeds to mirror that as wellâ. As part of the launch of the books category of the TikTok shop, the social media platform has collaborated with some of its creators, including Laurens Little Library and AP Beswick, to âgrow the BookTok community furtherâ.",Guardian,17/11/2022,TikTok to sell books directly to users via marketplace,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/17/tiktok-to-sell-books-directly-to-users-via-marketplace
98,"Wakefield Wines, an off-licence in Wakefield, UK, has become a viral sensation on TikTok. People travel from across the country to film videos at the shop, known for selling the sought-after ""hydration drink"" called Prime by YouTubers Logan Paul and KSI. Despite the high prices, customers are drawn to the experience. While some adults are unaware of the shop's fame, young customers practice catchphrases from the videos. The shop's employee defends the prices, but KSI advises fans not to pay inflated amounts.","Darren Grieves has travelled 130 miles (209km) from Carlisle with his three children to spend Â£66 on four drinks from an off-licence in Wakefield. The wagon driver has brought Darcy, 12, and nine-year-olds Lacy and Ryan to a fairly nondescript shop in the West Yorkshire city centre that has become an unlikely TikTok sensation. Wakefield Wines â or Wakey Wines, as it is more popularly known â is a viral hit, with people travelling from all over the UK to film videos, which each have hundreds of thousands of views, quoting popular catchphrases like âWhatâs the best shop in Wakey? Wakey Wines!â, âAbdul come closer, Abdul go backâ and âBingo bingo Gala bingoâ. It began when the shop, which is otherwise a normal off-licence, became known for being one of the only places youngsters can get hold of Prime, a âhydration drinkâ made by the YouTubers Logan Paul and KSI. It has also been called the UKâs most expensive newsagent, selling bottles of the sought-after drink for Â£19.99, a whopping 10 times the price of the drink in Asda, where it is now sold out. On Thursday, the Grieves family bought two bottles of the blue raspberry flavour and one of the lemon lime, as well as a can of camel milk â also a hit on TikTok â for Â£66. âIâve been sucked into it,â Grieves said, clutching his Â£6.50 camel milk outside the shop and looking slightly bewildered. âThe kids got me into it and Iâve been watching the videos every day. Itâs gone absolutely crazy. âIâve never done anything like this before,â he added, laughing. âItâs not worth it.â Lacy disagreed though, saying her friends will be jealous that she got her hands on a drink that is sold out on the YouTubersâ website. âIâll take the bottle to school. People put water in them,â she said. Though it is now perhaps as big as Binley Mega Chippy, a takeaway in Coventry that was also a TikTok triumph, the shopâs fame has passed many of its grownup customers by, despite some clues, such as cigarette lighters with the shopâs catchphrases being displayed on the counter. Melanie Pickering, who works at a solicitors firm in Wakefield, was buying snacks in the shop when she learned of Wakefield Winesâ success. âI had no idea but I think itâs very cool actually. I always like small local businesses doing well,â she said. Also visiting was teacher Jim Hutchinson and a class of six 15-year-olds who had stopped by after a trip from St Helens in Merseyside to the National Coal Mining Museum nearby, at the insistence of one of the students. The initial impression was underwhelming for Poppy Birkett, who exclaimed: âIs this all the hype? Youâve got to be joking.â But the teenagers took pictures outside the shop, with Bella Chaffers saying people at school would be impressed. âMy friends have definitely heard of it. Everyoneâs seen it on TikTok,â she said. Abdul Jabbar, who has worked in the shop for seven years and is often enlisted to film the videos of the owner Mohammed Az Nazir bantering with the customers, said parents had told him kids practise the catchphrases at home before their visit. âThey get excited when theyâre here, sometimes shouting, others playing music,â he said. While weekends often see queues of dozens of people outside the shop, some days are still fairly normal. While Jabbar maintains the markup on the drinks is small and that the price gouging happens at their supplier, KSI has criticised the shop for the âoutrageousâ prices. He told fans: âNo, do not pay that much for Prime. I know people want Prime OK, just wait or camp out Asda nice and early, get in Asda nice and early and pay Â£2, OK, Â£2 for Prime.â But that does not seem to be stopping customers like Grieves, who thinks the prices are all part of the experience. So when is he going to drink the camel milk? âTo be honest, I donât really like milk. Iâll probably just give it to the dog.â",Guardian,16/11/2022,Wakey Wines off-licence selling Prime and camel milk goes viral on TikTok,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/16/wakey-wines-off-licence-prime-camel-milk-viral-tiktok-wakefield

Andoh later backed down from her comments, saying that she did not mean to upset anybody.","Bridgerton star Adjoa Andoh has backed down from comments made on live TV as millions across the UK tuned in to watch the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla. 
Coverage of the event was broadcasted on numerous channels, with British free-to-air public broadcast television network ITV providing extensive coverage of the dayâs events.
Starting from the early morning, the channel aired a special edition of Good Morning Britain, followed by a dedicated program that was anchored by presenters Tom Bradby and Julie Etchingham. 
The duo was joined by a host of guests, including reporters on The Mall, where thousands of people gathered to witness the newly crowned monarchs.
However, the dayâs proceedings were briefly marred by a comment made by Bridgerton star Adjoa Andoh during the channelâs coverage. 
After the royal family appeared on the balcony, ITV cut to their temporary studio for reactions. 
When asked for her thoughts, Andoh remarked: âWe have gone from the rich diversity of the Abbey to a terribly white balcony. I am very struck by that. I am also looking at those younger generations and thinking: âWhat are the nuances that they will inhabit when they grow?ââ
The comment stunned the ITV presenters, and Myleene Klass was seen staring at the actor as she spoke.
The clip was later shared on Twitter, where it received a mixed response. Some people criticised Andoh for her words, while others applauded her for speaking out.
âThey are a white family, for goodness sake! Does she think individual families should be subject to diversity quotas?â one person wrote on Twitter. 
A second added: âIâm so confused by Adjoa Andoh. What did she expect to see? The royal family is a white family!â
âCanât believe a white family would be â¦ white. The audacity!â Sky News host Rita Panahi sarcastically tweeted. 
Dr Shola Mos-Shogbamimu, a high-profile lawyer and political activist who herself frequents ITV panels, defended Andohâs comments, claiming she âtold no liesâ.

The news has saddened fans and reignited discussions around mental health and the pressures faced by K-Pop idols.","Moonbin, a member of the South Korean pop group Astro and its sub-unit Moonbin & Sanha, has died, according to police. He was 25.
Authorities told Korean news outlet Yonhap News that the singer, whose real name was Moon Bin, was found dead in his home by his manager in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, at around 8.10pm local time Wednesday.
âHe appears to have taken his own life but an autopsy is being reviewed to determine the exact cause of death,â police said.
The official cause of death is pending, Page Six reports.
Moonbinâs record label, Fantagio, released a statement on Twitter on Wednesday confirming his death.
âFirst of all, I apologise for the sad and heartbreaking news,â the post, loosely translated, began.
âOn April 19, Astro member Moonbin suddenly left us and became a star in the sky.â
The statement noted that Moonbinâs relatives and all of those who worked with him, including bandmates Cha Eun-woo, Rocky, Yoon San-ha, MJ and Jinjin, were âdeeply mourning the deceased in great sadness and shock.â
The team asked fans to ârefrain from speculative and malicious reports so that that the bereaved families, who are deeply saddened by the sudden sad news, can reverently commemorate and greet the deceasedâ.
Moonbinâs funeral will be held âas quietly as possibleâ with only family members, friends and colleagues attending, the statement also said.
Meanwhile, fans flooded the Candy Sugar Pop singerâs 3.8 million-follower Instagram account to honour him.
One heartbroken follower wrote: âYou changed my life. You made me sooooo happy, Bin. Thank you for everything. Iâll love you forever. Rest in peace, my love.â
Another added, âHe always had such a big smile on his face which could automatically make a people smile too but now thatâs happiness is gone making everyone sad and loss of smile.â
A third said, âAs an old K-Poper I hate K-Pop â¦ I feel that those bad days we had in the past have been repeated again â¦ R.I.P. #Moonbin.â

His family has said he ânever lost his brilliant mindâ even at the end. While Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has remembered him as the âbrightest star in the galaxyâ and King Charles said he was âsaddenedâ by the tragic news. 
Humphries â famed for iconic comedy characters like Dame Edna Everage and Sir Les Patterson â died on Saturday following recent health issues caused by a broken hip.
Just weeks ago, Humphries had spoken of the âridiculous reasonâ behind the health ailment that would ultimately claim his life. 
His wife Lizzie was at his side as were his daughters Emily and Tessa while his UK based sons Rupert and Oscar flew in to join them. His 10 grandchildren were also present when he passed.
In a statement the Humphries family said he died peacefully at Sydneyâs St Vincent Hospital in Darlinghurst, east of the CBD. 
âHe was completely himself until the very end, never losing his brilliant mind, his unique wit and generosity of spirit,â the statement said.
âWith over seventy years on the stage, he was an entertainer to his core, touring up until the last year of his life and planning more shows that will sadly never be.
âHis audiences were precious to him, and he never took them for granted.
âAlthough he may be best remembered for his work in theatre, he was a painter, author, poet, and a collector and lover of Art in all its forms. He was also a loving and devoted husband, father, grandfather, and a friend and confidant to many.
âHis passing leaves a void in so many lives.
âThe characters he created, which brought laughter to millions, will live on.â
The Victorian government is in talks with the family of Barry Humphries about how best to pay tribute which could include the possibility of a state funeral.
âWeâre in conversation with his family in relation to the best way to honour his legacy and his contribution to Victoria, so thereâll be more information to come,â Victoriaâs minister for tourism, sports and major events, Steve Dimopoulos, said on Sunday.
He added a range of options are being discussed.
âThe primary mover of these things is the family because itâs their gift effectively to decide in conversation with government,â he said.
âSo, yes, it could be that [a state funeral]. It could be many other things to honour his legacy.
âRidiculousâ health battle
Humphries had been readmitted to hospital just days after being discharged after his health âworsenedâ.
Entertainment reporter Peter Ford broke news of Humphriesâ readmission to hospital on Sevenâs Sunrise, sharing that the comic had been determined to be back on stage by the end of the year
âBarry wonât give up easily. Whether thatâs a realistic goal, I donât know â¦ I am told that Barryâs health has worsened in the last week,â said Ford.
But his health complications due to ongoing issues from hip replacement surgery, an ordeal heâd been suffering from for several months, proved too much. 
Humphries revealed in an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald last month that heâd been in âagonyâ since breaking his hip.
âIt was the most ridiculous thing, like all domestic incidents are. I was reaching for a book, my foot got caught on a rug or something, and down I went,â he explained, revealing he was undergoing âvery painfulâ rehabilitation sessions.
Tribute flow for Humphries
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese took to Twitter soon after the news of Humphriesâ passing with a photo of Dame Edna Everage. 
âFor 89 years, Barry Humphries entertained us through a galaxy of personas, from Dame Edna to Sandy Stone,â he wrote. 
âBut the brightest star in that galaxy was always Barry.
âA great wit, satirist, writer and an absolute one-of-kind, he was both gifted and a gift. May he rest in peace.â
Global comedy superstar Ricky Gervais shared his parting thoughts on Humphries. 
âFarewell, Barry Humphries, you Comedy genius.â

Farewell, Barry Humphries, you Comedy genius.
Comedian Matt Lucas of Little Britain fame also paid tribute. 
âI wonder if all geniuses are as lovely as Barry Humphries,â he said. 
âThank you for delighting and inspiring us. Quite simply, you were the greatest.â
Peter Ford shared his tribute to the Australian entertainment icon.
âEven though the last paragraph has been inevitable for many days, itâs still incredibly sad,â he said. 
âWhat a brilliant mind and what a legacy. Australia will send many other more funny people into the world â but I canât imagine any will match Barry Humphries.â
British comedian Mark Gattis, creator of The League of Gentleman series, said the world was âblessedâ to have Barry Humphries. 
âStaggeringly inventive and permanently fascinated. An artist, a genius and a very, very, very, VERY funny man. Goodnight, possum.â
An Australian comedy legend
Born in 1934, Humphries started his comedy career in 1953 when he was still in his teens, joining the newly-formed Melbourne Theatre Company and debuting a character that would soon become a legend in her own right: Purple-haired Melbourne housewife, Edna Everage.
A prolific actor and writer across stage, film and television, Humphriesâ international career skyrocketed when he relocated to London in the 1960s. 
Humphriesâ film career began with the 1967 Peter Cook movie Bedazzled and continued through 1972âs The Adventures of Barry McKenzie, 1981âs Shock Treatment, 1997âs Spice World and 2003âs Finding Nemo. 
But Humphriesâ was arguably best known hilarious stage and television appearances as characters like Everage and Patterson. Dame Edna was chat show gold: Take this classic 2004 appearance on Michael Parkinsonâs chat show, where Dame Edna has the host and fellow guests Dame Judi Dench and Sharon Osbourne eating out of the palm of her hand â all while constantly insulting all three. 
While Humphries was recently beset by health problems since his hip-breaking fall, the legendary entertainer was still able to make headlines with his famous wit in recent years: A 2021 live appearance on British television sparked laughs â and controversy â when Humphries appeared to confuse the fill-in host with the showâs regular host, who had recently come out as gay. Some viewers didnât realise Humphries was in on the joke, as he never broke his poker face while congratulating the wrong host for his bravery in coming out. 
Humphries, who wed four times, is survived by his wife of 24 years, Elizabeth Spender, and four children.

4,"Former Married At First Sight star Domenica Calarco was eliminated from the reality TV show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, leaving her campmates and viewers shocked. Despite many expecting her to be a finalist, Calarco said she had a feeling she was going home and was grateful for the lessons she learned during her time on the show. Calarco's most memorable moment on the show was her confrontation with TV veteran Kerri-Anne Kennerley during a food trial, which saw Kennerley quit the show after just three days.","Many expected her to be the next Queen of the Jungle â but instead, Domenica Calarco has been booted out of the jungle.
The former Married At First Sight star was given her marching orders on Monday nightâs episode of Iâm A Celebrity â¦ Get Me Out Of Here! in a decision that left her campmates â and plenty of viewers at home â gobsmacked.
Twitter lit up as fans reacted to the stunning decision:
Noooo Dom. Didn't think I'd like her, but I do. Thought she'd go all the way #ImACelebrityAU
What just happened. Shook #ImACelebrityAU
Omg I didnÃ¢â¬â¢t see that coming!  #ImACelebrityAU
Nooooo! Dom #ImACelebrityAU
I genuinely thought Adam would leave before dom #ImACelebrityAU
Wow! I thought Dom would have gone further!  #ImACelebrityAU
I am genuinely shocked Dom has been eliminated. I honestly thought they were setting her up for the final. #ImACelebrityAU
TOTAL SHOCK! Really thought she would be in the TOP 3! Ã°Å¸ââ¢Ã°Å¸ÅÂ´#ImACelebrityAU
broooo i properly thought dom was gonna win this!? #ImACelebrityAU
While clearly disappointed by the verdict, Calarco told her campmates that sheâd âhad a feelingâ she was going home.
âI had a feeling today. I actually had a feeling,â she insisted as she said her goodbyes.
âI just want to say, I had the best time ever, guys. Smash it! Enjoy the last six days and Iâll see you all at the end of this.â
During her exit interview with Dr Chris Brown and Julia Morris, Calarco explained that her intuition had kicked in ahead of the elimination.
âWeirdly, today I had a feeling my time was over. I think yesterday conquering a huge fear of mine I felt, âOK my time here is done, Iâll be happy to leave whenever I do,ââ she said.
âOf course I would have loved to have won and have that money for my charity.â
She added: âI am a completely different woman. I am leaving the jungle just a better person. Maybe a few kilos lighter. I have learnt so many lessons. I have met incredible people that I will call my friends for life. 
âI just think, I know in myself now I am so much stronger than what I thought I was. That is a huge lesson. For that I will be eternally grateful.â
Calarco provided plenty of memorable moments during her time in the jungle, but none even come close to her explosive confrontation with Kerri-Anne Kennerley, which saw the TV veteran quit the show after just three days.
During a food trial early in the season, Calarco slammed Kennerley for refusing to take part or even attempt to take a bite.
Exploding in rage, the reality star brought up the make-up clause in Kennerleyâs contract â which meant sheâd been allowed to break the rules and bring cosmetics into camp.
âMiss big contract lady, âCanât tell me what to do.â I donât want your [make-up], I donât want your Revlon 1989 lipstick, doll. Itâs not fair â itâs not fair to everyone in there who actually tries,â Calarco said.
âWhy are you here, bro? Legit, actually, why are you here?â she continued, as Kennerley sat stunned.
âI probably donât have to answer anything to you,â she said back.
âOf course you donât! Because your little contract states it,â Calarco shot back.
âLiterally no respect or decency for anyone else but yourself. Iâve never met anyone so selfish in all my life.â

5,"Jock Zonfrillo, a celebrity chef and judge on MasterChef, has been found dead in a Melbourne hotel just weeks after he moved out of the rental home he had been living in with his family. The cause of his death is yet to be confirmed. The news of Zonfrillo's death has been met with shock and grief from fans, colleagues, and former contestants of MasterChef. The show's 15th season, which was scheduled to air on Monday night, has been postponed due to his sudden passing. Zonfrillo had recently relocated to Rome with his family.","Celebrity chef Jock Zonfrillo was found dead inside a Melbourne hotel just metres away from the home his family had recently moved out of to make a fresh start overseas.
Zonfrillo, 46, was found dead by police about 2am on Monday following a welfare check at boutique hotel Zagameâs House in inner-city Carlton.
The swanky hotel, which offers rooms for $650 a night, eerily backs onto the rental home Zonfrillo had lived in with his family since 2020.
Local business owners say they witnessed police vehicles arriving at the hotel in the early hours of Monday.
Zagameâs House management denied the MasterChef judge died at their hotel when contacted by news.com.au, despite numerous reports confirming police were called to the building.
Zonfrillo, his wife and their two young kids had reportedly packed up their bags and moved to the Italian city of Rome just three weeks before his death. 
Their home was placed back on the rental market for $3000 a week in April.
A neighbour of Zonfrillo in the Carlton terrace where he and his family had lived told Seven News on Tuesday that Zonfrillo âleft three weeks agoâ.
Carlton resident Stuart Ayer said: âHe left about three weeks ago. Obviously heâs come back and who knows what happened.â
Zonfrilloâs family announced the MasterChef judgeâs death in a statement on Monday afternoon.
âWith completely shattered hearts and without knowing how we can possibly move through life without him, we are devastated to share that Jock passed away yesterday,â his family said in a statement.
âSo many words can describe him, so many stories can be told, but at this time weâre too overwhelmed to put them into words.
âFor those who crossed his path, became his mate, or were lucky enough to be his family, keep this proud Scot in your hearts when you have your next whisky.
âWe implore you to please let us grieve privately as we find a way to navigate through this and find space on the other side to celebrate our irreplaceable husband, father, brother, son and friend.â
Tributes have poured in from all over the world for the late chef.

Zonfrillo was scheduled to take part in a number of media interviews both ahead of and following the first episode, which was due to air on Monday night.
One of these interviews involved the father-of-four appearing as a guest on Channel 10âs The Project in the evening of his death.
He had battled with a crippling addiction to heroin which had taken hold of his life by the time he was 15.
âIâm not proud of it at all,â he said about his drug use. âItâs embarrassing and itâs embarrassing for my parents. But Iâm thankful to have been able to come through the other side of that and Iâm thankful for all the people who helped me at the right moments.â
After getting clean, he followed a successful career path and joined the Channel 10 program in 2019 for the 2020 season alongside Melissa Leong and Andy Allen.

7,"Conservative politician Penny Mordaunt has gained attention following her prominent role in the coronation of King Charles and Queen Camilla last Saturday. As Lord President of the Privy Council, she was required to carry the Sword of State and hand Charles the Jewelled Sword of Offering, becoming the first woman to do so. Mordaunt's stylish appearance was also noted, with her bespoke teal dress and cape from Safiyaa, and matching hat designed by Jane Taylor. Her feat of upper body strength while carrying the Sword of State earned admiration from viewers, as did her poised demeanor. Some observers have even speculated that Mordaunt could be a future prime minister.","King Charles and Queen Camilla were the central focus of Saturdayâs coronation, but viewers frequently found their eyes straying elsewhere: towards a potential future prime minister of the United Kingdom.
Conservative politician Penny Mordaunt featured prominently during the ceremony in her role as Lord President of the Privy Council, which required her to carry the Sword of State, and to hand Charles the Jewelled Sword of Offering. She was the first woman in history to do so.
The Sword of State, which dates back to the 1600s and is also used during the state opening of Britainâs parliament, is 121 centimetres long and weighs 3.5 kilograms. Ms Mordaunt, 50, had to hold it aloft at a right angle from her body for long stretches of the two-hour event.

Her feat of upper body strength earned admiration from viewers, some of her political opponents among them. So did her stylish appearance, which contrasted strikingly with the parade of older, largely robed men around her.
Ms Mordaunt wore a bespoke teal dress and cape from London-based label Safiyaa, and a matching hat designed by Jane Taylor.
The outfit was embroidered with gold ferns, a âfeminisedâ reference to the traditional Privy Council uniform, and its colour was described as âPoseidonâ, a nod to her constituency in the seaside city Portsmouth.
âGot to say it, Penny Mordaunt looks damn fine! The sword bearer steals the show,â said Emily Thornberry, a Labour MP, prompting her amused followers to ask whether her Twitter account had been âhackedâ.
âThe Penny is mightier than the sword,â said another Labour MP, Chris Bryant.
Ms Mordaunt also impressed the American singer Courtney Love, who said she was âobsessedâ with the Tory politician.
âIâm now obsessed with Penny Mordaunt,â said Ms Love.
âObsessed! I couldnât take my eyes off her.â
Author Caitlin Moran joked that Ms Mordaunt and her sword were âthe âPippa Middletonâs Bumâ of the coronationâ, reminding viewers of Princess Catherineâs wedding and her sisterâs attention-grabbing dress.
The British press echoed that thought, with The Telegraph and The Guardian both labelling Ms Mordaunt âthe Pippa Middleton of the coronationâ, while The Daily Mailâs royal editor anointed her âthe âPippaâs bumââ of the event.

Ms Mordaunt is currently Leader of the House of Commons in parliament, and previously served as Britainâs defence minister. She twice ran for the Conservative Partyâs leadership in 2022, losing to Liz Truss and then to the current Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak. However her showing was strong enough in both instances to make her a future contender.
Her role in the coronation required less politicking, though according to Ms Mordaunt, there was some training involved.
âItâs drawing on all of my military drill experience,â she joked to Politico before the event, alluding to her time as a reservist in the Royal Navy.
âI will be carrying the Sword of State, which is the heaviest sword, so Iâve been doing some press-ups to train for that,â she quipped to The Timesâ Red Box podcast.
âIt has to be carried at right angles to the body â hence the need to do press-ups â pointing upwards, out in front of you, for some time. We practised with some replicas that were weighted. And itâs a huge honour to do it.â
Ms Mordaunt further joked that her experience as a reservist had trained her in the art of âstanding for long periods of timeâ without fainting.
In a social media post after the ceremony, she struck a humble note.
âHonoured to be part of the coronation with thousands of others who played their part,â Ms Mordaunt wrote.
âIâm very aware that our armed forces, police officers and others have been marching or standing for hours as part of the ceremony to keep us all safe. In comparison, my job was rather easier.
âHuge and heartfelt thanks to all who made this so remarkable. Iâm so proud of you all and the King and Queen today.â
That sparked one final moment of appreciation for her fashion sense, courtesy of the broadcaster Rylan Clark, who is set to host the BBCâs Eurovision coverage in a few days and replied: âCan I have your cape for Eurovision please?â",news.com.au,2023-05-06T17:49:00Z,Penny Mordaunt labelled âPippa Middleton of the coronationâ,https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/royals/pippa-of-the-coronation-world-swoons-over-penny-mordaunt/news-story/618131fdd44707382c9d23eafcb0db07
8,"Japanese company Kirin Holdings is set to acquire Blackmores, Australia's largest vitamin business, for $1.88bn. Kirin will pay $95 in cash per share to Blackmores shareholders, with the deal expected to go through in August following a shareholder vote in July. Marcus Blackmore, a major shareholder and former chairman of Blackmores, is in favour of the deal, stating that Kirin will be a ""brand custodian"" for the company. Kirin's CEO, Yoshinori Isozaki, welcomed the acquisition, saying that it presents an opportunity to transform the company's health science domain.","Much-loved Aussie vitamin brand Blackmores is set to be taken over by a major Japanese firm as part of a takeover deal worth a staggering $1.88 billion. 
On Thursday, Kirin Holdings â the parent company behind Lion, which owns Aussie beer brands including XXXX, Hahn and Tooheys â revealed it planned to take over 100 per cent of the countryâs biggest vitamin business. 
Under the plan, Kirin would pay shareholders a whopping $95 cash per share in order completely takeover the firm, with Blackmore shares jumping more than 20 per cent on the news.
If the deal goes through, Blackmores will be removed from the Australian Securities Exchange as soon as August.
Blackmoresâ shareholders will vote on the proposed deal in a July meeting.
However, it is expected to pass easily as the Blackmores board already unanimously advised shareholders to support the deal.
Major shareholder and former chairman Marcus Blackmore â whose father Maurice Blackmore founded the company in 1932 â is also on board, declaring Kirin would be a strong âbrand custodianâ for Blackmores.
âI believe this presents the next evolution of the business my father founded 90 years ago,â the 78-year-old said.
He also told Reuters he had wanted a way out for 18 months after developing an âantagonisticâ relationship with its board.
âWhen youâve spent 57 years at a business, you donât want to see the business suffer, and you want to see the business successful. I have no doubt in my mind that Kirin will deliver on that promise to me,â he said.
According to the Australian Financial Review, Mr Blackmoreâs 18 per cent stake in the company is worth $334 million. 
Kirin president and CEO Yoshinori Isozaki also welcomed the proposed sale in a statement.
âBlackmores presents an exciting opportunity to transform the scale and reach of our Health Science domain,â he said. 
âKirin Group is working to create social value and economic value by solving social issues through our business activities, and we have been transforming our business from a brewing business to a business model creating value across Food & Beverages and Pharmaceuticals domains, based on the concept of Creating Shared Value.â
The looming sale comes hot on the heels of a major recent controversy which saw social media users push for a company boycott after Mr Blackmore declared his opposition to the proposed Voice to Parliament and pledged his support for Northern Territory senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Priceâs âvote noâ campaign.
âIf Jacinta tells me I should vote no, I am voting no. She obviously knows a lot more about the Aboriginal issues than I do,â he told the Financial Review in February.
His comments saw the hashtag #Boycottblackmores shoot to the top end of Australiaâs Twitter trending list with outrage at Blackmoreâs stance flowing in thick and fast.
At the time, a Blackmores Group spokesperson said it was not able to comment on the views of Mr Blackmore who has not been an employee or director of the company since late 2020.
âHis views are completely independent of Blackmores Group,â they said.
âBlackmores is committed to supporting the health and wellbeing of all people and values and celebrates diversity, inclusivity and equality for employees, customers, partners, and those in the community.â",news.com.au,2023-04-27T01:34:30Z,Japanâs Kirin Holdings scores Blackmores vitamins in $1.85b takeover,https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/australias-blackmores-vitamins-snapped-up-by-japanese-beer-juggernaut-in-185b-takeover/news-story/6a22aba56f2b182e5cb260ae63328743
9,"Australian retail icon, David Jones, has come under fire after a customer service fail highlighted how some of the biggest brands are frustrating shoppers. Marketing expert and Queensland University of Technology professor Gary Mortimer shared a less-than-ideal shopping experience on Twitter after looking for help to pick the right $1,000 suit and to get the right size. David Jones apologised for not meeting customer expectations and blamed the service shortfall on the concessions being run by other brands, which are responsible for staffing, inventory, and service. Furthermore, department stores have been affected by online shopping and increasingly price-conscious shoppers. ","If youâre paying more than $1000 for some fancy new clothes you might expect store staff to fawn over you â or at the very least help ensure you get the right size. 
But a customer service fail at an Australian retail icon this week has highlighted how some of the biggest brands are frustrating shoppers. 
âIt was not what I expected,â said Queenslander Gary Mortimer of his shopping trip to David Jones in Brisbane. 
Professor Mortimer, who is a marketing expert at Queensland University of Technology, documented his less than ideal shopping experience on Twitter. 
âRespectfully, Iâve been wandering around David Jones Brisbane CBD for 10 minutes with a $1000 MJ Bale suit â just looking for a team member.â
In his uploaded video he wandered around the floor only to find the MJ Bale concession as well as concession after concession, and register after register, devoid of staff.
David Jones told news.com.au that âclearly in this instance we have not achieved customer expectations,â and said it had apologised to the customer. 
MJ Bale said it was âappalled to say the least,â at the customer service fail. 
The retail expert told news.com.au that he was at the Queens Plaza store about 2pm on Wednesday. Stopping by the stand of high end Australian brand MJ Bale he said there was no staff member there to help him pick the right suit. 
After 10 minutes at the concession, and after finding a suit, he then walked around the shop floor for another 10 minutes to try and locate someone â anyone â to help with sizing and direct him to the change room. 
âNot what I expected at David Jonesâ flagshipâ
âMaybe 15-20 minutes isnât too bad â but what was surprising was the lack of staff in many of the concessions in the menswear department,â Prof Mortimer said. 
âItâs definitely a âprice versus expectationâ situation. If youâre buying a higher-quality product, you expect higher levels of quality service.
âThis is not what I would have expected to experience at a David Jones CBD flagship store.â 
Prof Mortimer said the challenge for department stores was more of the floor space was being given over to concessions, not run by the store itself, meaning the customer experience could be wildly different depending on what brand you were purchasing. 
âItâs those brands that are responsible for staffing, inventory and service.â
But Prof Mortimer said it was more than that. Service in department stores could also vary depending on what branch of the same chain you were in. 
âI had quite the opposite experience at David Jonesâ Sydney Elizabeth Street store earlier in the week,â he said.
The Sydney CBD store is David Jonesâ undoubted Australian flagship.
A recent refit cost a whopping $400 million with the 12 storey retail behemoth featuring an entire floor dedicated to shoes, a top end food hall, multiple eateries and exclusive brands like Loewe and Balenciaga. 
âThere was plenty of staff there and great service too,â he said. 
The brand is the same but the challenge for David Jones â and other stores â is that there is often a very different shopping experience between their flagship branches and smaller, suburban outlets. 
âWe have been investing in service training nationally and have seen improvements in customer satisfaction levels,â a David Jones spokesman told news.com.au. 
âWe have met with Mr Mortimer and taken his feedback and apologised directly. David Jones remains committed to improving its instore and online experiences.â
A MJ Bale spokeswoman said the lack of staff wasnât up to scratch. 
âMJ Bale prides itself on our exceptional customer service, and weâre appalled, to say the least.
âWe will endeavour to make sure this never happens again.â
Certainly Australian department stores have gone through torrid times with the rise of online and increasingly price conscious shoppers. 
David Jones has been owned by the South African firm Woolworths Holdings â no connection to the supermarket of the same name â which bought the chain in 2014 for more than $2 billion.
But in December 2022, it agreed to sell DJs for what is thought to be just $100 million to private equity firm Anchorage Capital. The sale price was only a quarter of the cost of the Sydney CBD store refurbishment. 
However, the overall value of David Jones has been diminished by hundreds of millions of dollars after Woolworths Holdings either sold off â and rented back â many DJs stores or didnât include them in the sale to Anchorage.
Over the past two years David Jones has closed suburban stores in Brisbaneâs Toowong and Upper Mt Gravatt, while Myer recently announced it would exit its flagship store just up the Queen Street Mall from David Jones.
Yet both David Jones and Myer have done better of late. In March, DJs said sales were up 13.6 per cent in the first two months of 2023 while concessions, like MJ Bale, soared by 32 per cent. It said CBD stores were busy with customers as people shrugged off the last of the pandemic. 
Meanwhile, in January, Myer said it recorded its best result in nearly 20 years under CEO John King with profits for the half year up 104 per cent and sales rising by 37.9 per cent. 
The balance sheet is looking better but is that coming at the expense of in store customer service?",news.com.au,2023-05-05T03:40:16Z,David Jones blasted after customer fails to find staff member for 20 minutes,https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/not-what-youd-expect-epic-fail-in-david-jones-store/news-story/f62680afc98529b5f98acc368d3108ff
10,"A Twitter user named Brad Turner has sparked debate by claiming that the values of Australia's Anzac Day are ""no longer reflected"" in the country's actions. He argued that the society that holds paramount ideals of egalitarianism, mateship, and sacrifice is forgotten on the other 364 days of the year. He also criticized Australia's confrontation with China on behalf of the United States and claimed that the country marches right past veteran suicides, war crimes, illegal wars, and widespread inequality and corruption. While some people agreed with Turner, others hit back and said Anzac Day was still important and separated the fluff of ordinary living to reflect on sacrifice.","A Twitter user has sparked debate online with a controversial claim about Australiaâs relationship to Anzac Day.
Australians and New Zealanders gathered to commemorate the 108th anniversary of the landing of Anzac troops at Gallipoli in World War I on Tuesday. Services were held in cities and towns, big and small, to mark Anzac Day â the most solemn day on the Australian calendar.
But writing on Monday night, Brad Turner â who describes himself as a former Navy submariner and AFP officer â took to the social media platform to argue that the values of the annual celebration were âno longer reflectedâ in Australiaâs actions.
He took particular aim at Australiaâs confrontation with China on behalf of the United States.
Australia is a society that dutifully gets up early every April 25 to gather, Mach & remember our Dead.  Speeches are made, politicians speak of sacrifice & honour whilst possessing or embodying neither. That same society that holds paramount ideals of egalitarianism, mateship &Ã¢â¬Â¦ pic.twitter.com/sbHHbRiYAF
âAustralia is a society that dutifully gets up early every April 25 to gather, march and remember our dead,â he wrote in the post, which has been viewed more than 20,000 times.
âSpeeches are made, politicians speak of sacrifice and honour whilst possessing or embodying neither. That same society that holds paramount ideals of egalitarianism, mateship and sacrifice is forgotten on the other 364 days of the year. 
âOn those days Australia marches right past veteran suicides, war crimes, illegal wars and widespread inequality and corruption. Is it really a day of remembrance? Or is it theatrics so society can pretend they care about victims of war or our conduct as a country with an aim to feel better about apathy and inaction as a nation towards these things.
âWe donât notice any of these things because we are too busy marching. But this time itâs headlong into another pointless American war with China. The things we celebrate about our nation on Anzac Day are sadly no longer reflected in Australiaâs actions. They have not been in some time.â
A number of people agreed with Mr Turner.
âI donât like Anzac Day. It overlooks our follies in joining Britain and US wars. WWII was noble. The rest were con jobs to enrich the industrialists. Our people have all these solemn events only to assuage their âje ne câest quoiâ because they donât feel any guilt but should,â one wrote.
âOur politicians spend more on memorial monuments and museums that they can put their name on a plaque on the wall than they do for the actual veterans who are suffering from PTSD or other âsouvenirsâ they have brought back from their tours,â another agreed.
âFlag waving patriotism has taken over Anzac Day. We are one step away from parades of military hardware while the populace salute. What should be a reflection on the horrors of war has become itâs celebration. John Howard did this,â a third said.
âListening to the Labor government yesterday follow in the footsteps of the Coalition, justifying spending billions antagonising China at Americaâs request is not the âlest we forgetâ I think about,â a fourth wrote.
But others hit back and said Anzac Day was still important.
âMate â¦ itâs about remembering the sacrifice and loss of our mates â¦ lest we forget,â one wrote, adding, âI donât worry about [politicians] anymore grandstanding on the day. Itâs our day not theirs to remember our mates.â
Another said, âIt is tradition. It separates the fluff of ordinary living to reflect on sacrifice not only of the dead, of lives unlived, of the unfathomable grief but also of the living dealing with the trauma and moral injury of tooth and claw war. It is not a celebration which distracts.â
âI understand this perspective, but at the same time I ask myself â is there any harm in this form national reflection? I agree there have been some military follies following the absolute necessity of WWII, but would add that there is no guarantee that the next engagement is such,â a third wrote.",news.com.au,2023-04-25T04:41:10Z,"Anzac Day: Twitter user says values âno longer reflectedâ, slams âillegalâ wars, US-China confrontation",https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/military/no-longer-reflected-controversial-anzac-day-claim-goes-viral/news-story/73b149cdcb54b838a5ecbb5c79660551

13,"SpaceX successfully launched its Starship rocket, the most powerful rocket ever built, at its Starbase facility in Texas. The rocket, designed to transport up to 100 people from Earth to the Moon and Mars, was not expected to survive, and SpaceX and the Federal Aviation Authority agreed on a splash down in the Gulf of Mexico with no recovery. However, the rocket exploded due to a technical hitch before landing in the Gulf of Mexico. The launch was streamed online, attracting over a million viewers. SpaceX founder Elon Musk congratulated the team on Twitter and said he had learned a lot for the next test launch in a few months.","The most powerful rocket ever built was successfully launched today, before dramatically exploding due to a technical hitch.
Elon Musk, the founder of the company behind the rocket, SpaceX, had previously given the launch a 50/50 chance of success.
Mr Musk only wanted the rocket to get off the ground and not destroy the pad â two markers which SpaceX can successfully tick off, The Sun reports. 
But an âunscheduled disassemblyâ saw the rocket explode before landing in the Mexican Gulf, according to SpaceXâs current diagnosis.
âCongrats SpaceX team on an exciting test launch of Starship!,â Mr Musk wrote on Twitter soon after.
âLearned a lot for next test launch in a few months.â
Congrats @SpaceX team on an exciting test launch of Starship!Learned a lot for next test launch in a few months. pic.twitter.com/gswdFut1dK
The debut orbital launch of the $4.4 billion next-generation spacecraft took place at the SpaceXâs Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas.
Over one million people tuned into SpaceXâs lifestream of the test launch.
The 33-engine, nearly 123 metre tall, rocket is the eccentric billionaireâs biggest feat yet.
Starship has been designed to be the vehicle that makes humans interplanetary.
It is expected to take humans to the Moon through Nasaâs Artemis mission in 2025, and eventually to Mars sometime in the 2030s.
The mega-rocket is designed to transport up to 100 people from Earth to the Moon and Mars, so will eventually have its interior kitted out to support humans on months-long space voyages.
The team didnât bother decking out the interior as it would be on a Moon or Mars mission, as this edition of Starship was never intended to survive.
SpaceX and the USâ aerospace regulator the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) agreed on a splash down in the Mexican Gulf ocean with no recovery.
All boaters were banned from the waters below prior to the launch, to make room for the rocketâs so-called âbelly flopâ into the sea.
Todayâs launch follows a failed attempt on Monday, which was due to a pressurisation issue, according to SpaceX at the time.
When Starship was scheduled to launch on Monday, the coastguard was forced to remove a boat from the water.
It is possible they would have received a hefty fine, or even had their boating licence revoked.
All rocket launches in the US are bound by environmental standards set by the FAA, which had previously stood in the way of the 33-engine rocketâs flight approval.
Instead of being recovered like it would be in future missions, whatâs left of Starship will join its predecessors at the bottom of the pacific, where old rocket parts now act as artificial coral reefs for marine life.
However, it is likely most of the rocket burned up in the atmosphere.

Perth, in Western Australia, might be renowned for its slow-moving charm, but it has recently been given the title of being home to the countryâs most stressed out drivers.
Motorists in Fremantle, about 20 kilometres southwest of the city, topped the charts for road raging drivers, with them accounting for 72.7 per cent of stressed out tweets, according to data collected by Budget Direct. 
Seven out of the top ten roads that caused the most stress were also in Western Australia, with Perthâs Reid Highway, Leach Highway and Welshpool Road scoring 100 per cent for stressful tweets. 
Behind them were WAâs Kwinana Freeway, Roe Highway, Tonkin Highway and the Mitchell Freeway, with the latter only over taken by Victoriaâs Nepean Highway. 
The roads that caused the fewest stressed tweets were Victoriaâs Tullamarine Freeway, the Dandenong Bypass, Warrigal Road, South Gippsland Highway and the West Gate Freeway. 
In equal pole position with Fremantle for having the most rage behind the wheel were drivers in Queenslandâs coastal city of Mackay.

Behind it was Parramatta in NSW, Darwin in the Northern Territory, Wagga Wagga in NSW, Brisbane in Queensland, Byron Bay in NSW, Bendigo and Ballarat in Victoria, and Townsville in Queensland. 
While NSW and Victoria have the biggest population density, they didnât even crack the top three in terms of states with the most angry driving tweets. 
Drivers in the Northern Territory were the worst offenders, with 63.2 per cent of driving-related tweets being stressed which according to Budget Direct, made it the state where drivers were âmost likely to spark road rageâ. 
Queensland was the next worse offender with 57.4 per cent, then the ACT, WA, NSW, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania, respectively.
Drivers who were the least stressed on the road lived in NSWâs Newcastle, with their stress rate tweets just 44 per cent. 
Surveyed Australians indicated they were most peeved on the road by dangerous driving, aggression, or rudeness from other motorists. 
Tasmanians were found to be the least irritable, based on combining the situations that make people feel angry or annoyed. 
Meanwhile, Queensland drivers were the most easily ticked off.

15,"A photo of a fake ""Chinese police car"" with Chinese characters for ""police"" stencilled on the bonnet and ""special police"" along the side, and a Chinese police badge on the front door, has sparked outrage on social media. Reddit users quickly pointed out that the car was not actually affiliated with the Chinese government and that the markings were just decoration. While the cars may not be officially affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party, many online said they still served a purpose. The sightings sparked calls from the Greens at the time to tighten laws in the ""grey area"" around impersonating foreign police in Australia.","A photo of a fake âChinese police carâ in Melbourneâs southeast has sparked outrage on social media.
The photo, uploaded to Reddit on Sunday, showed a dark Nissan sedan with Chinese characters for âpoliceâ stencilled on the bonnet and âspecial policeâ along the side, and a Chinese police badge on the front door.
âWhy is there a marked Chinese police car in the southeastern suburbs of Melbourne?â user MediocreStream wrote along with the photo.
Reddit users quickly pointed out that the car was not actually affiliated with the Chinese government and that the markings were just decoration.
âChinese students think itâs funny,â one wrote. âSource: Iâm from over there. Also: Itâs not funny. China is literally known to kidnap dissidents that arenât even Chinese citizens anymore from overseas.â
It comes after a bombshell investigation last year revealed China was secretly running illegal âpolice stationsâ overseas, including at least one in Sydney, in order to harass and spy on its citizens living on foreign soil.
While the cars may not be officially affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party, many online said they still served a purpose.
âItâs passed off as cosplay but is used to intimidate local Chinese communities as an extension of CCP power,â one Reddit user wrote.
But another said, âBelieve it or not, itâs just some young and stupid Chinese students showing off their stupidity. CCP intimidating programs usually involve threatening parents/children/relatives in China, not by showing some police cars. Source: I am Chinese Australian.â
A Victoria Police spokeswoman said she was unable to comment without more information about the time, date and location of the photo, and which station it was reported to.
Cars with similar markings were spotted in Adelaide and Perth in 2019, following rallies in Australia supporting Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrators.
At the time, WA Police said officers spoke to the driver of one of the vehicles who âstated he purchased the decals onlineâ and âplaced them on his car as a jokeâ.
After violent clashes between pro-Hong Kong and pro-China protesters at Adelaideâs Rundle Mall, the organiser of the rally told the ABC people felt âintimidatedâ by the car spotted around the city.

âI think itâs highly inappropriate, especially when you pretend to represent a foreign law enforcement unit in a Western country,â she told the broadcaster.
âInitially we thought it was a bit of a joke. We did receive reports of it a few days before our protest â¦ Could this be an organised effort by the Chinese government or is it really just two completely separate instances of a prank?â
SA Police later tracked down the owner of the BMW. 
They would not reveal further details about the car or its owner but warned people to be careful if they were approached by anyone who arouses suspicion.
âWhile the markings on the BMW by themselves do not appear to constitute an offence, police are still making inquiries,â a police spokeswoman told The Advertiser.
The sightings sparked calls from the Greens at the time to tighten laws in the âgrey areaâ around impersonating foreign police in Australia.
Political activist Drew Pavlou shared the latest photo on Twitter, writing, âItâs illegal to impersonate Australian police officers but somehow itâs fine to impersonate foreign police in Australia. We need legislation making it illegal to impersonate foreign police otherwise it is too easy for the CCP to intimidate and terrorise dissidents in Australia.â
Later on Monday he posted another photo a Jeep 4WD with the same insignia, which he said had been spotted on the NSW south coast by a follower of his page.
âWhile we are not able to verify the authenticity of the images provided, police have previously looked into reports of vehicles with similar insignia and no offence was identified,â a NSW Police spokeswoman said.

Some social media users said the decals, which can be purchased online for around $10, were sometimes put on cars by Chinese students who ""think it's funny"". Others argued it was ""passed off"" as a joke but was ""used to intimidate local Chinese communities as an extension of CCP power"".","More photos have emerged of a fake âChinese police carâ in Melbourne that sparked outrage on social media earlier this week.
The dark grey Nissan Altima sedan has Chinese characters for âpoliceâ stencilled on the bonnet and âspecial policeâ along the side, and a Chinese police badge on the front door.
A photo of the car in Melbourneâs southeast suburbs first went viral after being uploaded to Reddit on Sunday. 
âMore photos of same fake Chinese police car in Australia, this time spotted in West Melbourne,â political activist Drew Pavlou wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, sharing two pictures of the same car parked on Adderley St.
âIt is absolutely unacceptable to impersonate the Chinese police in Australia. Anonymous members of Chinese Australian community have sent this to me in fear.â
In another twist, a search of the Commercial Passenger Vehicles Victoria public register shows the car is an approved rideshare provider for platforms such as DiDi or Uber.
Some social media users said the decals, which can be purchased online for around $10, were sometimes put on cars by Chinese students who âthink itâs funnyâ.
But others argued even though the cars might not be officially affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party, it was âpassed offâ as a joke but was âused to intimidate local Chinese communities as an extension of CCP powerâ.
Victoria Police on Thursday confirmed it was âaware of images of a vehicle in Melbourne which appears to have been fitted out with various unofficial decals to give the appearance that it is a Chinese government vehicleâ.
âAt this time no specific offences have been detected and we have not received any reports in relation to the matter,â a spokesman said.
On Monday, Mr Pavlou shared another photo of a Jeep 4WD with the same insignia, which he said had been spotted on the NSW south coast by a follower of his page.
âWhile we are not able to verify the authenticity of the images provided, police have previously looked into reports of vehicles with similar insignia and no offence was identified,â a NSW Police spokeswoman said.
Cars with similar markings were spotted in Adelaide and Perth in 2019, following rallies in Australia supporting Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrators.
At the time, WA Police said officers spoke to the driver of one of the vehicles who âstated he purchased the decals onlineâ and âplaced them on his car as a jokeâ.
In South Australia, after violent clashes between pro-Hong Kong and pro-China protesters at Adelaideâs Rundle Mall in 2019, the organiser of the rally told the ABC people felt âintimidatedâ by the car spotted around the city.
âI think itâs highly inappropriate, especially when you pretend to represent a foreign law enforcement unit in a Western country,â she told the broadcaster at the time.
âInitially we thought it was a bit of a joke. We did receive reports of it a few days before our protest â¦ Could this be an organised effort by the Chinese government or is it really just two completely separate instances of a prank?â
SA Police later tracked down the owner of the BMW. They would not reveal further details about the car or its owner but warned people to be careful if they were approached by anyone who arouses suspicion.
âWhile the markings on the BMW by themselves do not appear to constitute an offence, police are still making inquiries,â a police spokeswoman told The Advertiser.
The sightings sparked calls from the Greens at the time to tighten laws in the âgrey areaâ around impersonating foreign police in Australia.
It comes after a bombshell investigation last year revealed China was secretly running illegal âpolice stationsâ overseas, including at least one in Sydney, in order to harass and spy on its citizens living on foreign soil.
This week, authorities in the US arrested two men in connection with one such âsecret Chinese police stationâ, funded by Beijing, operating in the heart of New York City.
Two US citizens were arrested and charged with conspiring to act as agents of the Chinese government and obstructing justice in connection with the New York site.
Harry Lu Jianwang, 61, and Chen Jinping, 59, appeared in court in Brooklyn on Monday. The pair allegedly operated the police station in Manhattanâs Chinatown district which was shut down late last year.
China has said the âpolice stationsâ were actually âoverseas service centresâ where Chinese citizens in the US could renew documents such as driving licences.
But US officials have said they were set up at the behest of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, claiming they undertook activities including identifying and harassing Chinese nationals in the US who were critical of the Communist Party regime.
Beijing hit back at the arrests and accused the US of âCold War thinkingâ â a common rebuke from Chinese officials.
âChina firmly opposes the US sideâs slandering, smearing, engaging in political manipulation, and maliciously concocting the so-called transnational repression narrative,â foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters.

17,"A conspiracy theorist has claimed that new U-turn bays installed on Narre Warren North Road, near Melbourne, are part of a sinister plan to restrict people to living in so-called 15-minute cities. These communities are designed to provide all essential services within walking or cycling distance, reducing dependence on cars and promoting healthy and sustainable living. However, some believe they are part of a plot to keep people under government control, and the new U-turn bays, along with pillars with weird blue lights, are intended as checkpoints. The theory has been criticised, with some pointing out the bays were added for safety reasons.","A 15-minute city conspiracy theorist has made a bold claim about the construction of multiple U-turn bays on a Victorian road, as debate over the urban-planning concept continues globally. 
In a video shared to Twitter, an Australian podcaster filmed herself driving along Narre Warren North Road which is situated 38km southeast of Melbourne and is currently undergoing upgrades.
The roadworks commenced in 2020 and are part of the state governmentâs Big Build project which entailed the addition of extra lanes, installation of traffic lights and road safety improvements. 
Final asphalting works, guardrail and signage installations, line markings and vegetation works are currently underway with the project expected to be completed by mid this year.
In line with the project, extra U-turn bays were created for safer and easier access to streets adjacent to the main road. 
However, the conspiracy theorist believes these turnaround lanes have been installed to serve a more dire purpose, believing more 15-minute or 20-minute cities are set to pop up in the future. 
Also known as smart cities, the notion is an urban development idea where everything you need access to is located within a short distance.
This may include schools, shops, GP clinics and even the office or your place of work, all within the same zone. 
The concept is the brainchild of Franco-Colombian urbanist Carlos Moreno who came up with the idea to prompt more sustainable, convenient and healthier living.
Key elements of the theory include keeping essential services close, creating a sense of community solidarity and inspiring green urban living.
However, not all are convinced, with some conspiracists comparing the theory to a Stalin-style plot to keep people in lockdown or under the governmentâs control.
In the case of the woman who filmed herself driving along Narre Warren North Road, she believes the road upgrade project will become a âCheckpoint Charlieâ for smart cities.
âThis used to be a country road. Not only are they building wires and towers but theyâre also putting in interestingly three or four U-turn opportunities,â she explained in the video.
âI guess thatâs because youâll get a warning â youâre about to leave your 20-minute city, your district, your zone (and itâs your) last chance to turn back obviously before the fines start.â
As she drives further down the road, the woman highlights three âpillars with weird blue lightsâ positioned in the middle of the road next to several parked tradie cars. 
âUp here to the right youâll see three bollards â¦ I think this right here is the checkpoint,â she claims in the video. 
âThereâs now all of these opportunities to pull a U-turn and go back the way you came.
âIn the future, going out to the countryside is not something theyâre going to allow you to do without you handing over your money.â
The tweet, which has received over 1.3 million views and 692 likes, has amassed debate over the urban planning concept online with many arguing the woman has taken her thoughts âtoo farâ.
âThis is ridiculous. U-turns, or access for emergency vehicles? Or both? Forget something and need to go back home? A U-turn is handy. This is not a nefarious thing,â one person tweeted.
â15 minute (cities) have been around for ages and have nothing to do with climate change lockdowns. Itâs literally about ease of access and reducing dependency on cars,â a second person said.
âNo one is preventing you from going further away in your car.â
A third comment read: âThe wires reduce accidents. The breaks in the wire provide access points for emergency vehicles to turn. 
âThese safety measures can be found on roads around Australia.â
Meanwhile, one man suggested the push for electric vehicles (EV) over petrol cars could be another excuse to restrict people to their âzoneâ.
âIâm thinking this is one of the major reasons they want EV versus gas vehicles, fewer and less range!â he said. 
The debate online follows huge rallies around the world as conspiracy theorists criticise the concept, which has already come into effect in 16 cities globally including Paris and Shanghai. 
Edmonton Canada was also another city which tried to implement the idea, however received backlash from its residents.
âYou will spend 90 per cent of your life in this 15-minute area as they are monitoring your carbon footprint,â a flyer circulating warned.
Meanwhile, those who agree with the theory have slammed its critics, including registered nurse Christopher Patterson and national radio broadcaster Triple J Hack. 
âThere are a lot of noted intellectuals on TikTok telling me I should be suspicious of convenience,â Triple J Hack reporter Shalailah Medhora said in a radio package last month. 
Dr Patterson, who is also a University of Wollongong lecturer, explained there are numerous health benefits to the theory that many sceptics are overlooking.
âThe main (benefit) is giving people back their freedom (and) time,â Dr Patterson said.
âThe time you get back you could put into (your) health or sitting in green spaces to connect back with your community and family.â",news.com.au,2023-04-18T04:26:22Z,15-minute cities: Womanâs bizarre claim about Victorian road project,https://www.news.com.au/technology/motoring/on-the-road/checkpoint-charlie-woman-makes-wild-smart-city-claim-about-victorian-road/news-story/d5a6df870d6b7b29f73330371624b62c

His pivot to Twitter comes after the site has become more welcoming to mostly conservative accounts previously banned for spreading hate speech and disinformation under Elon Musks new direction. It's unclear what Carlson's plans mean for his remaining contract with Fox, which runs until 2025.","Tucker Carlson will be reviving his show on Twitter, after being abruptly dismissed from Fox News last month. In a tweet captioned âWeâre back,â Carlson on Tuesday shared a video discussing his next moves. The former host said he would be taking his show to Twitter, which he described as âthe last remaining platform in the worldâ to allow free speech. Carlson offered few details but promised a ânew version of the show weâve been doing for the last six and a half yearsâ. He did not mention when the show may air. But he did echo many of the same points he has often asserted: that the so-called mainstream media is full of propaganda and lies. âTwitter is not a partisan site, everybodyâs allowed here and we think thatâs a good thing,â he said. âAnd yet, for the most part, the news that you see analyzed on Twitter comes from media organizations that are themselves thinly disguised propaganda outlets.â Carlsonâs pivot to Twitter comes after the site has become more welcoming to mostly conservative accounts previously banned for spreading hate speech and disinformation under Elon Muskâs new direction. The billionaire took over the site in October 2022 and promptly allowed previously banished accounts to return, including that of Donald Trump. Carlson did not make any mention of Musk in his video. Twitter responded to a request for comment with a poop emoji. Musk, who has referred to himself as a âfree speech absolutistâ, tweeted on Tuesday: âWe have not signed a deal of any kind whatsoever. Tucker is subject to the same rules &amp; rewards of all content creators.â Itâs unclear what Carlsonâs plans mean for his remaining contract with Fox, which runs until 2025. Typically, television companies include a no-compete clause when someone leaves the air. Axios reported on Tuesday that Carlsonâs lawyers sent a letter to Fox accusing the network of fraud and breach of contract. The letter reportedly argued that the noncompete provision in Carlsonâs contract with the network is no longer valid. Fox and and a representative for Carlson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. During the Trump presidency, Carlson had become one of the most successful hosts on the network, garnering a dedicated following while spouting xenophobic and racist rhetoric on his show. His show was terminated last month, in the aftermath of the $787.5m settlement of a $1.6bn defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems, over the broadcast of Donald Trumpâs lies about voter fraud in his 2020 presidential race defeat by Joe Biden. Fox News has not commented on the reason for Carlson going off air. But multiple outlets have reported that abusive comments about executives contributed to the decision. Sources close to Carlson have disputed that. Since his departure, leaked videos and text message have shown Carlson making misogynistic and insinuating remarks; saying the Fox Nation streaming channel âsucksâ; and calling a Dominion lawyer a âslimy motherfuckerâ. Following Carlsonâs departure from Fox News, his former employers have replaced his popular show with an interim program called Fox News Tonight, which features rotating pundits from the network until a replacement can be found.

1,"Twitter has admitted to a privacy breach that allowed tweets meant only for users' Circles to be seen by the wider site. The feature enables users to share private thoughts with a selected list of friends, but a security incident earlier this year allowed tweets to be viewed by those outside of the Circle. For weeks, users had been reporting Circles tweets receiving likes and views from accounts that should not have been able to see them. The issue was eventually identified and fixed by the Twitter security team. However, Twitter did not address reports that similar privacy breaches were occurring to ""private"" accounts.","A privacy breach at Twitter published tweets that were never supposed to be seen by anyone but the posterâs closest friends to the site at large, the company has admitted after weeks of stonewalling reports. The siteâs Circles feature allows users to set an exclusive list of friends and post tweets that only they can read. Similar to Instagramâs Close Friends setting, it allows users to share private thoughts, explicit images or unprofessional statements without risking sharing them with their wider network. But, in an email to affected users seen by the Guardian, Twitter admitted tweets had escaped this containment. âA security incident that occurred earlier this year,â the email says, âmay have allowed users outside of your Twitter Circle to see tweets that should have otherwise been limited to the Circle to which you were posting.â For weeks, users had been reporting Circles tweets receiving likes and views from accounts that should not have been able to see them. Twitter, whose press office has been largely destaffed and set to autoreply to requests for comment with a poo emoji, did not acknowledge the reports. Now, the company says the issue âwas identified by our security team and immediately fixed so that these tweets were no longer visible outside of your Circleâ. âTwitter is committed to protecting the privacy of the people who use our service, and we understand the risks that an incident like this can introduce and we deeply regret this happened,â the company said. The email did not address separate reports that similar privacy breaches were occurring to âprivateâ accounts, whose tweets should not be displayed to anyone save for their approved followers. Since Elon Musk acquired the company in late 2022, Twitter has shed at least 60% of its headcount, with wave after wave of layoffs stripping teams to the bone. Over the same period, the site has experienced numerous outages, leading Musk to declare that it would not be stable until a âcomplete rewriteâ of the siteâs underlying code was completed. Similar cost-cutting measures have led the service to stop paying bills for office space, janitorial supplies and web hosting, with mixed success. Even as Musk attempted to institute a full return-to-the-office mandate, Twitter employees in countries including Singapore and London faced eviction from their workplaces over unpaid rent bills. More pressingly, layoffs in site-wide moderation teams have opened the company up to massive fines in countries including Germany, where effective content moderation is a legal requirement. The âsystematic failureâ of the social network to moderate well allows for fines of up to â¬50m (Â£44m) a case, the German lawyer Chan-jo Jun told TechCrunch last month.",Guardian,6/05/2023,Twitter admits to âsecurity incidentâ involving Circles tweets,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/06/twitter-admits-to-security-incident-involving-circles-tweets

Nish Kumar is one of our foremost political satirists and Guardian journalist Coco Khan is unfailingly witty about current affairs.

HV Thereâs a podcast for that This week, Rachel Aroesti chooses five of the best podcasts about planet Earth, from a deep dive into our oceans to an experiential travel adventure Naturebang Presented by Becky Ripley and Emily Knight, two BBC Radio 4 documentary producers, Naturebang is â unsurprisingly â a show about nature and wildlife. Yet itâs one that is particularly well-suited to those who donât normally gravitate towards straightforward science documentaries: each episode focuses on a natural phenomena and then asks how we might apply it to human society. Looking at bull elephants provides an opportunity to think about fatherhood; an investigation into the busyness of ants leads to a discussion of leisure time; and the traditions of the Great Tit allow for a meditation on cultural orthodoxy and immigration. Utterly fascinating, even if biology isnât really your thing. Your Place or Mine Part fact-packed travel guide, part gentle parlour game, this pod sees guests attempt to convince presenter Shaun Keaveny that their chosen location is well worth a visit. Some of the places pitched are classic holiday destinations, but others are locales you may never have considered: comedian Daliso Chaponda suggests Lilongwe in Malawi; chef Ching He Huang chooses Taipei; actor Aatif Nawaz goes for Lahore. Despite the chat being divided into rather dry-sounding sections â weather, hazards, landmarks and travel â our wisecracking host and his knowledgeable sidekick, historian and geographer Iszi Lawrence, ensure that it is always shot through with silliness and fun. The Deep-Sea Podcast Considering that 71% of our planetâs surface is covered in water, this show may just be the most on-topic of all when it comes to podcasts about the earth. Hosted by long-time pals Dr Alan Jamieson, a world authority on the deepest levels of our oceans, and Dr Thomas Linley â an expert in deep-sea fish â this accessible and often exhilarating series covers topics from bioluminescence to seamounts in an attempt to overhaul the stereotype of the deep-sea as a terrifying, unknowable place. The pair have also attracted some surprisingly starry guests, including Titanic director and avid sea explorer James Cameron. Trees A Crowd The passion project of actor David Oakes (who can be seen playing Earl Godwin in Netflixâs Vikings: Valhalla), this show is indeed a detailed exploration of Britainâs trees â 56 different types of them, to be exact, from the much-worshipped Rowan to the anti-inflammatory Dogwood, the gloriously pink Spindle to the giant Aspen â but itâs also much more than that. The affable Oakes is frequently joined by those whose work is deeply entrenched in the natural world, including artists, zoologists, wildlife photographers, adventurers and activists, leading to conversations that feel like a brain-cleansing break from technology-riddled modern life. Armchair Explorer Traverse the wildest corners of the earth from your sofa with the help of this podcast from travel writer Aaron Millar, who encourages listeners to live vicariously through some of our most fearless explorers.

The moderation systems and measures put in place to mitigate those risks will also be checked by the EU. Platforms will also be banned from building profiles of child users for companies to target them with ads. Those platforms that can be reached by minors must also put in place measures to protect their privacy and keep them safe. Users must also be able to report illegal content easily.

4,"""The Flash"" movie, which was previously rumored to be scrapped due to star Ezra Miller's legal and reputational issues, has now been called one of the greatest superhero movies of all time by press and cinema owners at Las Vegas' CinemaCon. The movie, which is loosely based on the Flashpoint comic book run, will reset the DC multiverse and feature two versions of The Flash played by Miller, along with the return of Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck as Batman and Sasha Calle as Supergirl. The film is expected to ""break the universe"" and change the past, with potential ramifications for DC that go beyond what has been seen in advance publicity.","What a difference a few months makes. Talk as recently as September was that Andy Muschiettiâs The Flash might be scrapped due to the legal and reputational difficulties faced by star Ezra Miller. Flash forward to the present day, and it is being called one of the greatest superhero movies of all time following a screening for press and cinema owners at Las Vegasâ CinemaCon this week. Letâs just put that into perspective. According to the assembled geekerati (who have only been given permission to tweet at this time), this is a movie that might just be up there with The Dark Knight, the original Superman, Black Panther, Avengers: Endgame and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. And itâs made not by all-conquering Marvel but Warner Bros-owned DC. This is the studio that gave us the original Suicide Squad movie, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League, all films that made even comic book fans wonder if they actually liked superhero films. It arrives with a new regime at DC Studios, led by former Marvel man James Gunn, with the promise that it will reset the DC multiverse in a way that allows us to forget everything weâve seen before. Or at least, all the stuff Gunn doesnât fancy moving forward with. The Flash is loosely based on the seminal Flashpoint comic book run, which saw Barry Allen waking up in an alternate reality where Superman is a frightened weakling, Batman is Thomas Wayne (Bruceâs dad) and the Amazons and Atlanteans are destructive forces who seem to be engaged in perpetual war. While Muschiettiâs film is likely to cherry-pick from its source material, we do know that Miller will play two versions of The Flash (in the comics, the second Flash was the Reverse-Flash: in the film it will be a Flash from an alternate timeline). Michael Keaton will return to the role of the caped crusader, and so will Ben Affleck, while Sasha Calle is reportedly a revelation as Kara Zor-El/Supergirl. A new trailer, released this week with impeccable timing, shows us that the new film will see Allen âbreaking the universeâ and changing the past. Itâs likely there will be ramifications for DC that go way beyond what weâve yet seen in advance publicity. Frankly, this looks epic! The wonderful thing about multiverse movies is that they are primed and ready to explain away all kinds of superhero universe bad planning (of which there has been a lot at DC since 2013âs Man of Steel ushered in the Zack Snyder era) as simply the result of clashing alternate timelines. Moreover, if the new Supergirl does end up wowing audiences, or Michael Shannonâs General Zod gets the opportunity to shake the DC foundations that he should have received a decade ago, there is ample opportunity to bring them back in future episodes. Rumour is this will be Batfleckâs final turn in the cape and cowl, but if heâs well received â well thereâs no reason that has to be set in stone. Perhaps that skulking, meat-headed guy with the guns from Dawn of Justice was just a bad Bruce Wayne from another universe where everythingâs back to front and audiences love to turn up in their gazillions to watch really terrible movies. There are other reasons to be cheerful here. If the hype turns out to be true, The Flash may just present a much-needed blueprint for how to represent Batman (Batmen?) in ensemble comic book movies, a feat that nobody has ever really successfully achieved before (with the possible exception of Snyderâs directorâs cut of Justice League). Now all we need is for Robert Pattinsonâs dark knight to turn up, and it could be time to really get this superhero party started.",Guardian,28/04/2023,âOne of the best superhero movies everâ: can The Flash live up to the Twitter hype?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/28/one-of-the-best-superhero-movies-ever-can-the-flash-live-up-to-the-twitter-hype

The DSA requires compliance measures such as publishing an independent audit of its compliance with the legislation. Failure to comply with the act could result in fines of up to 6% of global turnover and, in extreme cases, a temporary suspension of service. The designated companies now have four months to comply with the act's obligations.","Twitter is among the tech firms that will face the toughest level of scrutiny under a new European Union regulatory regime for monitoring digital platforms, after warnings from Brussels that the Elon Musk-owned platform is unprepared for the new rules. The company, which Musk bought in October 2022, has been designated a âvery large online platformâ under the blocâs Digital Services Act, which means complying with measures such as publishing an independent audit of its compliance with the legislation. It will be joined by 16 other major names including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Wikipedia, Snapchat and TikTok. Twitter has been repeatedly warned that it is not ready for the new rules, with breaches risking a fine of 6% of global turnover and, in the most extreme cases, a temporary suspension of the service. Under Muskâs ownership Twitter has reduced its workforce from 7,500 people to about 1,500, leading to fears that moderation standards and its ability to comply with the act would suffer as a consequence. In November last year, the EUâs commissioner for the internal market, Thierry Breton, implied that Twitter was in danger of non-compliance with the act, telling Musk that the company will have to raise its efforts to âpass the gradeâ. Breton added that Musk had âhuge work aheadâ to comply with the DSA. However, a readout of the November meeting with Musk added that the Tesla CEO had âcommitted to complyâ with the DSA. In January, Breton again urged Musk to âprogress towards full compliance with the DSAâ, with Musk replying that the DSAâs goals of transparency, accountability and accurate information were aligned with Twitterâs. Under the rules for large platforms, they must carry out annual risk assessments outlining the risks of harmful content such as disinformation, misogyny, harms to children and election manipulation. The moderation systems and measures put in place to mitigate those risks will also be checked by the EU. The big platforms will also have to publish an independent audit of their compliance with the DSA, as well as how many people they employ in content moderation. They must also provide details of their algorithms and allow independent researchers to monitor compliance with the act. Platforms will also be banned from building profiles of child users for companies to target them with ads. Those platforms that can be reached by minors must also put in place measures to protect their privacy and keep them safe. Users must also be able to report illegal content easily. The European Commission, the EUâs executive arm, confirmed Twitterâs designation as a VLOP on Tuesday, while Google and Microsoftâs Bing will also have to comply with similarly strict regulations after being designated âvery large search enginesâ. Tech platforms must reach at least 45 million monthly active users in the EU in order to be designated VLOPs or VLSEs. There are also regulations for smaller platforms such as publishing transparent terms and conditions. Breton said on Tuesday the âcountdown is startingâ for the companies designated with special status under the act. âToday is the D(SA)-Day for digital regulation,â he said. Guillaume Couneson, a partner at law firm Linklaters, said complying with the VLOP and VLSE provisions was a âchallenge for everyoneâ and not just Twitter. The designated companies now have four months to comply with the actâs obligations including the first annual risk assessment. âIt is not a long period of time to implement strict and in some cases burdensome obligations,â said Couneson.",Guardian,25/04/2023,âUnpreparedâ Twitter among tech firms to face tough new EU digital rules,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/25/unprepared-twitter-among-tech-firms-to-face-tough-new-eu-digital-rules
6,"Twitter has given a verified gold tick to far-right political organisation Britain First and its leader Paul Golding, who was jailed in 2018 for religiously aggravated harassment. The move came after a shake-up of Twitter's verification system under new owner Elon Musk. Twitter is charging UK entities £1,140 a month for official gold tick status, while personal accounts are being charged £9.60 for a blue tick. Twitter's new paid-for verification system encountered more difficulties on Monday as the platform gave a gold tick to a fake Disney account, in the latest example of rogue actors launching ""approved"" parodies.","Twitter has given a gold tick to Britain First, the far right political organisation, after a shake-up of its verification system under new owner Elon Musk. The partyâs leader, Paul Golding, has also received a blue tick for his account, which means that his posts will be boosted in conversations and will be ranked higher in user searches. Golding was jailed in 2018 for religiously aggravated harassment. Twitterâs gold tick designates a verified organisation that is a business or non-profit entity, according to the platformâs website. Twitter is charging UK entities Â£1,140 a month for official gold tick status, while personal accounts are being charged Â£9.60 for a blue tick. Britain First, whose policies include prison terms for âany attempt to alter the demographic makeup of the British Islesâ, had its account suspended in 2017, but it was allowed back on to the platform after Muskâs takeover last year. The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a campaign group, accused Twitter of promoting extreme content to drive controversy and user engagement with the aim of generating more revenue. âTwitter is now a topsy-turvy world where users have been told to ignore information supplied by good, reliable actors and pay undue attention to the bottom-feeders who want to spread hate, misinformation and sow division,â said Imran Ahmed, CEO of CCDH. âItâs harder and harder to know what to trust on the platform, while bad actors are put on a pedestal.â The Britain First account has 12,700 followers and Goldingâs has 45,300. Twitterâs new paid-for verification system encountered more difficulties on Monday as the platform gave a gold tick to a fake Disney account, in the latest example of rogue actors launching âapprovedâ parodies. An account with the handle @DisneyJuniorUK secured a gold tick on Monday morning. The account was suspended at 11.30am BST, but not before announcing that the cult animation series South Park was âofficially heading to Disney Juniorâ. It was not clear whether the holder of the account â which had 2,087 followers â paid the $1,000-a-month cost for the tick or was given it for free. This has been happening with blue ticks for large personal accounts following the launch of a cull last week for legacy accounts that had not paid for verification. However, the account holder indicated surprise at receiving a tick on Monday, tweeting âNo fucking wayâ and âThis isnât actually real rightâ. The user that claimed to be running the fake Disney account, @7virtues_, had tweeted a poll on Monday asking whether to deactivate the account âso I donât get murked by the Disney hitmenâ. Twitterâs previous attempt at charging for verification under new owner Elon Musk was pulled in November last year after the opportunity to pay for a verified account was hijacked by pranksters. A fake account representing pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly â which had paid for verification â announced free insulin, while the gaming firm Nintendo and the pope were among the other victims of impersonators. The impersonation issue was one of the drivers behind a fall in advertising revenue on Twitter since Muskâs October 2022 takeover. Advertising accounted for 90% of Twitterâs $5bn in annual revenue before the deal, and Musk revealed in February that he expects turnover at the company to be less than $3bn this year, suggesting a slump in its ad business. Disney declined to comment. It is understood that Disney, which stopped broadcasting the Disney Junior UK channel in 2020 and pulled the related Twitter handle at the same time, had contacted Twitter on Monday morning as soon at it was made aware of the account. A request for comment from Twitterâs press office on the Britain First and Disney Junior UK accounts was met with an automatically generated poo emoji, as is now standard for all journalistic queries directed at the company.",Guardian,24/04/2023,Far-right Britain First party given Twitter gold tick,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/24/far-right-britain-first-twitter-gold-tick
7,"Twitter has reinstated the ""blue tick"" verification status for celebrity users of its social network, including those who did not pay for it. The decision to do so without distinguishing between paid-for and free users has led to criticism of false advertising, as the boilerplate disclaimer for those users inaccurately describes their status as being granted ""because they are subscribed to Twitter Blue"". The move to strip all ""legacy"" users of the blue checkmark that indicated their account was genuine had unforeseen consequences, with fewer than 500 of the 400,000 legacy users signing up to the subscription fee.","Twitter has again U-turned over its verification policy, restoring the âblue tickâ free of charge to celebrity users of the social network. But the siteâs decision to reinstate the âverifiedâ status without distinguishing between paid-for and free users has led to criticism for false advertising, since the boilerplate disclaimer for those users inaccurately describes their status as being granted âbecause they are subscribed to Twitter Blueâ. The social network ended its old verification system on Friday 20 April, a date apparently chosen because of its significance in cannabis culture, and in the process stripped all âlegacyâ users of the blue checkmark that indicated their account was genuine. But the move, which left only those users who had paid for Twitterâs subscription service with a checkmark, had unforeseen consequences for Elon Musk, the social networkâs owner and chief executive. Rather than encouraging pre-existing verified users to splash out the subscription fee, which starts at $8 a month, the overwhelming majority simply continued using the site. Public data shows that fewer than 500 of the 400,000 legacy users signed up, and almost as many users cancelled their subscription at the same time, for a net revenue increase of less than $300 a month. As a result, a blue tick on the social network rapidly came to mark out a user as paying for the privilege, leading to a grassroots campaign to âblock the blueâ, with users committing to blocking subscribers on sight. Not every user with a blue tick had paid for it themselves, however. On Friday, Musk revealed that three had received one for free: Stephen King, LeBron James and William Shatner. Over the weekend, that number drastically increased, with almost every celebrity user with more than 1 million followers receiving a new blue tick (with one notable exception: Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter and of the decentralised Twitter competitor Bluesky, who did not get a new verification mark). The rapid loss of social credibility for having such a mark, however, led many users to disclaim their new status. Re-verified users including the Guardian columnist Owen Jones, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Twitter comic dril all revealed that their new status had come without them paying for or requesting it. Other users have been unable to issue such statements. The actor Paul Walker, who died in 2013, the celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain, who died in 2018, and the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered by the Saudi state that same year, were all given âpaid-forâ verification. Some, including Jones and dril, wondered whether doing so, and marking their accounts as having âpaid forâ a service they did not, was plausibly illegal. âIsnât it some form of defamation to falsely make it look like people have purchased a product associated with being a total loser,â asked Jones. (Dril joked that Musk had âfired the people in charge of telling him itâs illegalâ.) English law protects celebrities against the tort of âpassing offâ, when individualsâ goodwill is harmed through misrepresentation. According to the solicitors Lewis Silkin, âin 2002, a landmark case established beyond doubt that celebrities can use passing off to protect the goodwill in their celebrity. Racing driver Eddie Irvine successfully sued TalkSport over a direct mailing piece which featured a photograph of him holding a portable radio which had the TalkSport name and logo on it. In fact, Irvine had been holding a mobile phone at the time the photo had been taken, but it had been digitally manipulated to replace the phone with the radio. âThe judge decided that the advertisement clearly gave rise to a false impression of endorsement of the radio station by Irvine, and that the law of passing off should protect him from this infringement of his goodwill.â A request for comment to Twitter went unanswered save for the companyâs standard automatic response, an emoji of a smiling poo.",Guardian,23/04/2023,Twitter restores âblue tickâ free of charge to celebrities in U-turn,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/23/twitter-restores-blue-tick-free-of-charge-to-celebrities-in-u-turn
8,"Twitter's new policy for verified accounts has caused chaos on the website, with impersonation and false information running rampant and few people signing up for the service the changes were meant to promote. Under the new Twitter Blue program, individual users can pay $8 per month for a blue checkmark while organizations pay upwards of $1,000 monthly. The change has shifted the meaning of the check from an account that has been independently verified to one that paid a premium to help their tweets be seen by more people. Despite Twitter's aggressive promotion of the program, few additional sign-ups under the new rules have been seen.","Friday marked the first full day Twitterâs new policies for verified accounts were applied â and the results were not pretty. Twenty-four hours after blue checkmarks began to disappear from formerly verified Twitter accounts, chaos reigned on the website, with impersonation and false information running rampant and few people signing up for the service the changes were meant to promote. The move came under new owner Elon Musk, who has pledged to make the struggling social media firm profitable by any means necessary â in this case, attempting to force users to pay for verification services that were previously free. Under the original blue-check system, Twitter had roughly 400,000 verified usersand checks meant that Twitter had verified that users were who they said they were. Under the new Twitter Blue program, individual users can pay $8 per month for a blue checkmark while organizations pay upwards of $1,000 monthly. The change has shifted the meaning of the check from an account that has been independently verified to one that paid a premium to help their tweets be seen by more people. The rollout â and its results â have been chaotic. Hereâs where things stood on Friday: Elon taketh and he giveth away Several high profile Twitter users and celebrities lost their verification status on Thursday, including BeyoncÃ©, Pope Francis, and Oprah Winfrey. President Donald Trump â who has not tweeted since he was allowed to return to the platform after being banned â has also been unverified. Some celebrity users â including basketball star LeBron James, author Stephen King and Star Trekâs William Shatner â pledged not to join Twitter Blue. All three still had blue checks on Friday after Musk said he paid for them himself. âMy Twitter account says Iâve subscribed to Twitter Blue. I havenât. My Twitter account says Iâve given a phone number. I havenât,â wrote Stephen King on Twitter. âYouâre welcome namaste,â replied Musk, who apparently gave it to the author for free. âVerifiedâ loses meaning Blue checks for users on Friday included a popup message noting the account âis verified because they are subscribed to Twitter Blue and verified their phone numberâ. But verifying a phone number simply means that the user has a phone number and they verified that they have access to it â it does not confirm the personâs identity, raising concern about the veracity of such accounts. Many took advantage of the new verification-free world on Twitter by changing their profile pictures and names to impersonate prominent figures, from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to the late Arizona Senator, John McCain. Others made prank tweets posing as legitimate news accounts to spread misinformation making fun of Musk. The ability to pose as legitimate organizations and figures raised concerns that Twitter could lose its status as a platform for getting accurate, up-to-date information from authentic sources, including in emergencies. Fake accounts claiming to represent the Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot, Chicagoâs department of transportation and the Illinois department of transportation all began sharing messages early Friday falsely claiming that the cityâs Lake Shore Drive â a major thoroughfare â would close to private traffic starting next month. The genuine accounts for Lightfoot and the transportation agencies did not have a blue or gray check mark as of Friday. Lightfootâs office said the city is aware of the fake accounts and âworking with Twitter to resolve this matterâ. At least one was suspended Friday. And while is Twitter now offering gold checks for âverified organizationsâ and gray checks for government organizations and their affiliates, it was not always clear why some accounts had them Friday and others did not. Accounts from major transit systems in cities such as Paris and San Francisco as well as official weather trackers had lost their verification status as of Friday afternoon. Many impacted agencies said they were awaiting more clarity from Twitter, which has sharply curtailed its staff since Musk bought the San Francisco company for $44bn last year. Sloppy execution, few sign-ups The roll out of Twitter Blue â from user response to its execution â has been a flop. Some pointed out that it appears the blue checkmarks were not fully removed from Twitterâs system, flickering on and off for days before removal. Meanwhile, Twitter is continuing to push the program aggressively, telling advertisers that they are required to subscribe to Twitter Blue in order to continue running ads â at a time when cash flow from Twitterâs top advertisers has shrunk 65%. Twitter has seemingly yet to greatly benefit from the massive change in policy, with various calculations of its Twitter Blue subscribers showing any additional sign-ups under the new rules have been inconsequential. Independent researchers noted that according to publicly available information from Twitterâs API â which is now available by subscription only â there was only a net increase of 28 accounts on Twitter Blue in its first day when accounting for the number of people that unsubscribed. Another report put the number closer to 400 new accounts. An independent analysis from Travis Brown, a Berlin-based developer of software for tracking social media, found fewer than 5% of legacy verified accounts appear to have paid to join Twitter Blue. This story was amended on 24 April 2023 to reflect that there was a net increase of only 28 accounts the day of the Twitter Blue relaunch, when accounting for the number of cancelled subscriptions.

9,"Twitter has removed the blue verification tick from a number of high-profile accounts including Cristiano Ronaldo, Beyonce, Kim Kardashian, JK Rowling and Sir Paul McCartney, as part of a move towards a subscription-based verification system known as Twitter Blue. The social media site's new owner, Elon Musk, had previously criticised the old system as ""bullshit"" and insisted that verified accounts should have to pay for the status. Twitter Blue subscribers will benefit from boosted rankings in search and conversations, while their replies will receive greater prominence, but critics have warned that the move could damage the site's reputation for trustworthiness.","Twitterâs aristocracy is no more. Last year, Elon Musk described the verification process as a âlords &amp; peasants systemâ and on Thursday he deployed the guillotine. Feudalism has now given way to capitalism: money gets you status. In a long-threatened cull, famous names including Cristiano Ronaldo, BeyonceÌ, Kim Kardashian, JK Rowling and Sir Paul McCartney lost the blue ticks that confer verified status on accounts. On 1 November, shortly after buying the social media platform, Musk decried the system for verification, tweeting: âTwitterâs current lords &amp; peasants system for who has or doesnât have a blue checkmark is bullshit.â Soon, he wrote, users would have to pay for accreditation, adding: âPower to the people!â Accounts affected by Thursdayâs move had not signed up to the Twitter Blue subscription service, which costs from $8 a month in the US, Â£9.60 in the UK and A$13 in Australia, and is now the only way of securing that coveted blue tick â unless Musk chooses to cover the cost himself. The change has stripped the blue tick from about 400,000 legacy verified accounts. The blue tick is not just an honorific, however. Subscribers to the new service will get boosted rankings in conversations and search, while their replies will also receive greater prominence. Tweets that they interact with will also benefit. It means that maintaining influence or presence on the platform will cost money from now on, whereas it was free under the previous system whereby blue ticks reassured users that the accounts were who they said they were. However, Musk has said that users will still be able to see unverified accounts that they follow on the platformâs default For You feed. Some safeguards against imposter accounts â which bedevilled a previous Twitter Blue push â have been introduced, such as blocking new accounts from signing up to the service for 30 days. The Twitter Blue website page adds that the platform is âworking on an updated process for new Twitter accounts in order to help minimise impersonation risks and may impose and change waiting periods for new accounts without noticeâ. Muskâs move is largely rooted in financial motivations, despite the anti-feudal rhetoric. When he tried to pull out of the deal to buy Twitter he argued he was doing so because he believed the platform was plagued by vexatious automated accounts. Twitter acknowledged the platform had a bot problem â largely related to pornography and cryptocurrency content â but Musk alleged it was much bigger than the company was letting on, meaning advertisers could not gauge whether they were receiving value for money. Under legal pressure from Twitter, Musk was forced to push ahead with the takeover but he remained adamant that bots were a problem and paid verification was the best solution. He said in his 1 November Twitter thread that giving paid-for verified accounts priority in replies, mentions and search was âessential to defeat spam/scamâ, presumably under the logic that a bot account would not pay for a tick and would thus be less prominent. Musk is also determined to reduce Twitterâs dependence on advertising, something he has already achieved with a botched Blue relaunch in November that led to a slew of impersonation accounts that in turn contributed to an advertiser exodus (some advertisers had also expressed concerns about moderation standards post-takeover). In its last published set of accounts, advertising represented 90% of Twitterâs $5bn (Â£4bn) in annual revenue. According to Musk recently, revenue is due to drop to less than $3bn this year. Costs have also been slashed sharply, with staff numbers cut by about 75% to 1,500 people, which Musk says has seen off the threat of bankruptcy. But if advertisers do not return in force he will need more than the 600,000-635,000 Blue subscribers the platform is estimated to have, which equates to about $5m+ a month in revenue. Loss of verified status may persuade some users to pay up. According to the software developer Travis Brown, who tracks Twitter Blue subscriptions, the number of signups has risen from 550,000-585,000 at the start of the month to his latest estimate of up to 635,000. In the meantime, however, Twitter has to hope that this move does not damage a priceless but intangible commodity: trust. If Musk is replacing a feudal system, he needs to do it with a structure that will last. Journalists and commentators are among the thousands of accounts that lost their ticks on Thursday. âTwitterâs approach may help its business, but wonât help people identify who or what is worth listening to and the danger is that it will ultimately degrade trust that is critical for long-term sustainability,â says Nic Newman, a senior research associate at the Reuters Institute for the Study Journalism.",Guardian,21/04/2023,Why Elon Muskâs cull of Twitter âverifiedâ blue ticks could prove costly,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/21/elon-musk-twitter-cull-verified-blue-ticks-cost

Under Muskâs plans for Twitter Blue, subscribersâ replies will gain greater prominence in usersâ default For You feed, while tweets you interact with will also be boosted. However, Twitter will continue to display accounts that people follow in their For You feed, whether or not they are Twitter Blue subscribers. Musk has said the switch to paid-for verification is necessary to eradicate automated bot accounts and generate an alternative source of income to advertising, which accounts for most of Twitterâs income. Gary Lineker, the Match of the Day presenter and prominent tweeter, confirmed to his 8.9 million followers on Friday that he had paid for a blue tick. Responding to a tweet by Jemima Khan, in which the screenwriter said she had paid for a Twitter Blue subscription and was now a member of the âuncool gangâ, Lineker tweeted: âsame hereâ. The tech news site the Verge reported on Thursday that a Twitter employee had emailed LeBron James recently to âextend a complimentary subscription to Twitter Blue for your account, @kingjames, on behalf of Elon Muskâ. James, who has more than 52 million followers, had been a prominent opponent of paying for verification, stating last month that he âainât payingâ for a blue check. King, the multimillion-selling writer of The Shining and It, expressed bafflement he now had a verified account that told followers clicking on his blue check that he was a Twitter Blue subscriber. He wrote: âMy Twitter account says Iâve subscribed to Twitter Blue. I havenât.â Musk, indicating he had stepped in on Kingâs behalf to help him retain his verified status, replied: âYouâre welcome namaste.â Official organisations have had their blue checks replaced with a grey âofficialâ tick, including the account for Pope Francis. Bellingcat, the investigative news outlet, said it had been offered a grey tick as its founder, Eliot Higgins, said he had not paid for his own blue check. He added: âI fully expect to be asked to pay for it in the near future.â However, some official sites such as the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services account did not have a grey tick as of Friday morning. Perks for Twitter Blue subscribers include the ability to edit tweets, write longer posts and see fewer adverts. There was also confusion over fake accounts, an issue that has dogged Muskâs attempts to introduce a verification system, with a false New York City government account tweeting at the authentic NYC government account that âTHIS account is the only authentic Twitter account representing and run by the New York City Governmentâ.

Musk, who purchased the company for $44bn in 2022 and has thus far struggled to make it profitable, has been threatening to remove what he called âlegacy blue checksâ for months now. The checkmark previously denoted accounts that had been verified for authenticity and was given to accounts of celebrities, journalists and media outlets. Now users seeking verification will have to pay for Twitter Blue, a controversial $8 a month subscription program under which any account can obtain a blue checkmark.

SCOTUSblog, a news website that follows the workings of the US supreme court, said it would cease posting on Twitter entirely. The publication follows a similar move from NPR, the US radio network, which left Twitter last week after being labeled as a âstate-affiliated media outletâ under new platform policies. The removal of free verification processes has also raised concerns about the risk of misinformation and impersonation of legitimate organizations and people.

On Thursday, the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, the metro system in the San Francisco Bay Area, where Twitterâs headquarters are located, tweeted it had applied for such a checkmark but had not heard back from the company. Experts have stated that the failure to verify such entities increases the risks of scams and even threatens to collapse disaster response online, with agencies like the National Weather System now check-less. Impersonations have been a recurring problem since Musk took over the company.

Thousands of tweeters â myself included â fled to Mastodon: a scrappy social media project designed from its start in 2016 to be resistant against takeovers by billionaires. Mastodon is decentralized: instead of a single website, itâs a network of thousands of independently run servers â each with their own moderators and users â who can interact with each otherâs posts, called âtootsâ, using an open protocol called ActivityPub. Other social media services can connect to ActivityPub as well, so no one app can monopolize the broader network that Mastodon is part of, called the âfediverseâ. All that posed a bit of a learning curve. In addition to learning the new terms, I had to carefully choose a server, which would determine who would be in charge of my data, and what toots I would see most often. Mastodonâs creator, a German programmer named Eugen Rochko, told me at the time that his creation could be âslightly more difficult to graspâ than Twitter. âBut weâre not trying to be an exact copy,â he said. âWeâre trying to make something better.â Musk has appeared threatened at times. In December, he banned links to Mastodon on Twitter and suspended users who posted their Mastodon handles, including Mastodonâs official account. Days later, he suddenly reversed course, calling the ban a âmistakeâ during a Twitter Spaces livestream. âFucking post Mastodon all goddamn day long, I donât care,â he said. Nearly half a year later, has Mastodon seized the momentum? Data shows that it saw a huge surge of interest late last year: its monthly active users increased more than eightfold to a high of 2.6 million about a month after Muskâs Twitter purchase. But that number has since dropped to just 1.2 million â a sign that Mastodon remains far from the levels of hype that would threaten a behemoth like Twitter. âItâs definitely the case that itâs slowed down,â says Nathan Schneider, a University of Colorado Boulder professor who researches collective ownership models and runs a small Mastodon server called social.coop. âI think a lot of people came and found it a little hard. Using Mastodon can feel like eating your vegetables.â Is bigger actually better? Some of Mastodonâs most passionate users â who tend to be more tech-savvy than average â say itâs no problem if the community stays small. Here, things arenât designed to go viral quickly. Thereâs no global search or global hashtags. Servers can easily be made private, and admins can block other servers to combat trolls. Thereâs also a feature to put posts behind content warnings, which users are encouraged to do for sensitive topics. J Logan Carey, an illustrator, has a much smaller following on Mastodon than he did on Twitter, âbut people seem to actually see the things I post on there whereas on Twitter I feel like everything gets algorithmically squashed unless youâre a brand or a celebrityâ, he says. Brett Elliff, a systems engineer, says he has been âreally lovingâ Mastodon after using it for a few months: âI only see what I want to follow, and there are actual conversations happening instead of people shouting into the ether.â And Tiffany Li, a technology attorney and law professor, says Mastodonâs small user base âmeans that there are fewer trolls and generally unpleasant peopleâ. Another enthusiastic Mastodon adopter is Jeff Jarvis, a professor at the City University of New Yorkâs Newmark Journalism School. Jarvis arranged for the school to fund a yearâs worth of operating costs for journa.host, a Mastodon server home to a few thousand journalists who have been verified by volunteers. âI find the discourse in general to be richer and nicer,â Jarvis says about Mastodon. âI think mass media corrupted the internet with its definitions of scale, that you had to be huge because you had to get a big audience to go to advertisers.â Mastodonâs diminutive size has turned off digital marketers, who have mostly shunned it and other Twitter alternatives as niche âdistractionsâ that would be a waste of ad dollars. But itâs also disappointing some activists searching for a way to get their message out without feeding Elon Muskâs machine. In January, Hannah Roditi, the executive director of Social Movement Technologies, a non-profit that provides digital tools training for progressive activists, hosted a Mastodon training session. It was the most popular session the group had ever hosted, with more than 600 attendees from over 100 countries. Attendees were tired of Twitterâs hate speech problem and opaque policies: some human rights campaigners had lost their accounts when their governments asked Twitter to take them down. But while Mastodon feels safer, Roditi finds it less useful. âWe want to be able to hijack hashtags and get material in front of people instantly,â she says. âBut a big portion of the world is on Twitter. Theyâre not on Mastodon. Itâs more limiting.â Andrea Learned, the host of a climate podcast, has also found Mastodon too challenging. âI have been frustrated by how non-intuitive it is to make a list and follow other climate media,â she tells me over email. âWe are all waiting for our various communities (in my case #BikeTwitter , urbanists, #PlantBased) to âlandâ some one place. So â we all dabble on several platforms and no big momentum is seen.â âThe homeownersâ association of social mediaâ Mastodon may be more of a village than a global arena â but that doesnât mean itâs always welcoming. Johnathan Flowers, an assistant professor of philosophy at California State University Northridge, started a Mastodon account last November after Musk bought Twitter. But after he posted some observations about the racial politics of the platform, users demanded that Flowers, who is Black, hide those posts behind content warnings. âTheir problem was that I wasnât following the cultural codes that they felt should prevail in the digital space â¦ [they felt there should be] a social entitlement to comfort around issues of race and racism,â he says. When he declined to use content warnings, he received a torrent of racist abuse in his inbox. âOn Twitter, it took me a little over two years to say something that got me a bunch of racist trolls in my DMs and mentions,â he says. âOn Mastodon, it took 48 hours.â The scholar was also hassled by users who were unhappy that he was using a tool to cross-post his posts from Twitter to Mastodon. âIâm just like, âWhat are you guys doing? Why are you being cops?â Thereâs no wonder that we started calling Mastodon the homeownersâ association of social media,â he says. In February, Flowers brought up some of his observations to Rochko, Mastodonâs creator. âI am hopeful that it gave him a more nuanced perspective on the platform that heâs running,â Flowers says. âBut as for whether itâll spark real change, your guess is as good as mine. This isnât a technical problem that one could fix with new features. This is a cultural problem.â (Rochko did not respond to a request to comment for this story.) These days, Flowers has mostly stopped using Mastodon, not necessarily over the race issue, but because its weak discovery and search features made it too hard to find the people he wanted to follow. âIt took me weeks to find some of my best friends and academic colleagues,â he says. Now he logs in for two main reasons: to check on âthe kind of interestingly diverse Star Trek community there,â and to look at cat pictures. Mastodon versus the monopolists Until recently, the Mastodon non-profit had just one full-time employee maintaining the software: Rochko. The organization is funded primarily through donations on Patreon, which add up to around $32,000 a month â a drop in the bucket compared with the trillions thrown around by tech giants. Itâs also facing new competition from established names: Meta has said itâs working on its own decentralized social network, code-named P92, which will reportedly connect to ActivityPub. And Twitterâs co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey is getting ready to unveil Bluesky, a decentralized social media app that will come with a new protocol of its own. Despite this, Rochko has swatted away Silicon Valley investment offers worth âhundreds of thousands of dollarsâ, arguing that it would compromise his project. âMastodon will not turn into everything you hate about Twitter,â he said. âThe fact that it can be sold to a controversial billionaire, the fact that it can be shut down, go bankrupt and so on. Itâs the difference in paradigms [between the platforms].â Schneider, the collective ownership researcher, says itâs heartening that Rochko refused the money. âIf he took that investment, if it adopted that kind of monopolistic business model that venture capital tends to require, this would cease to be the thing that itâs meant to be.â But it doesnât change the fact that there arenât great alternative models. âIt continues to reflect what remains my major anxiety of this whole moment, which is that we as a society are chronically incapable of investing in something better,â he says.",Guardian,18/04/2023,Thousands fled to Mastodon after Musk bought Twitter.

13,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has intervened in a dispute over Twitter's decision to label the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) as ""government-funded"" after Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre called on Twitter owner Elon Musk to do so. The CBC paused its activities on Twitter after some of its feeds carried the label ""government-funded media"". Poilievre praised the move, calling the CBC ""Trudeau propaganda"", but Twitter changed the label to ""69% Government-funded Media"" from ""70% Government-funded Media"" after the CBC disputed the claim. The CBC is funded through parliamentary appropriations, but under Canada's Broadcast Act, it is guaranteed editorial independence.","Prime minister Justin Trudeau has waded into a feud over Twitterâs decision to label Canadaâs public broadcaster as âgovernment-fundedâ, accusing his main political rival Pierre Poilievre of enlisting the help of tech executives in an attempt to defund the network. Last week, the Conservative leader called on Twitter owner Elon Musk to label the English-language feed of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporationâs âgovernment-fundedâ â but stopped short of asking for the French arm of the network to also be given the same label. On Monday, the broadcaster said it would âpause our activities on Twitterâ after some of the networkâs feeds started carrying the label âgovernment-funded mediaâ. Soon after, the accountâs label was changed to â69% Government-funded Mediaâ by Twitter. The label had previously read â70% Government-funded Mediaâ, but Musk said the âCanadian Broadcasting Corp said theyâre âless than 70% government-fundedâ, so we corrected the labelâ. âOur journalism is impartial and independent. To suggest otherwise is untrue. That is why we are pausing our activities on Twitter,â the CBC tweeted. Poilievre previously praised the decision, tweeting that ânow people know that it is Trudeau propaganda, not newsâ and directing users to a Conservative party petition to defund the network, a long-running goal of the party. CBC has disputed the âgovernment-fundedâ label, saying the broadcaster was âpublicly funded through a parliamentary appropriation that is voted upon by all Members of Parliamentâ. Under the countryâs Broadcast Act, the CBC is also guaranteed editorial independence. Radio-Canada, the immensely popular French language broadcaster, is funded through the same appropriations. Poilievre has not suggested he would defund the French language services, which he says provide a valuable resource for the linguistic minority. But political analysts also suggest the Conservative leader was hoping to avoid angering voters in Quebec, where he will need to perform well if he hopes to topple Trudeau in the next election. âAttacking this Canadian institution, attacking the culture and local content that is so important to so many Canadians, really indicates the values and the approach that Mr Poilievre is putting forward,â Trudeau told reporters on Monday. âIn order to attack this institution that is important for many, many Canadians, he runs to American billionaires, the tech giants that they continue to defend.â Twitter owner Musk has made a number of controversial changes to the popular social networking site, including asking users to pay for âverifiedâ blue accounts, revoking the verification of the New York Times and labeling broadcaster National Public Radio as âstate-affiliatedâ media. The broadcaster announced last week it would leave Twitter in protest. Public TV broadcaster PBS also suspended tweets, citing the same reason. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also objected to Twitter labeling it as âgovernment-funded mediaâ on the companyâs main account and Musk said the social media platform will now change the BBCâs label. When asked for comment on its decision to label CBCâs English language wing as âgovernment-fundedâ, Twitterâs communications department responded to the Guardian with an auto-generated poop emoji.",Guardian,17/04/2023,Canadaâs CBC âpausesâ Twitter use after government-funded media label,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/justin-trudeau-pierre-poilievre-twitter-cbc
14,"Twitter has labelled the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) as ""government-funded media,"" a move that suggests the media outlets lack independence. The labelling system has previously been used on China's Xinhua news agency and Russia's RT outlet, as well as on the US's Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. The latter two stopped using Twitter after being labelled ""state-affiliated media,"" which Twitter later changed to ""government-funded media."" Both ABC and SBS said they would not quit Twitter, but the SBS spokesperson called the ""publicly funded media"" label more accurate.","Twitter has slapped a âgovernment-funded mediaâ label on the ABC and SBS. The social media platform led by Elon Musk has been labelling media organisations in a way that could imply they lack independence. The USâs Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio (NPR) stopped using Twitter after being labelled âstate-affiliated mediaâ, a tag that was later changed to ââgovernment-funded mediaâ. NPR said it would âno longer be active on Twitter because the platform is taking actions that undermine our credibility by falsely implying that we are not editorially independentâ. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The âstate-affiliated mediaâ tag had otherwise been applied to Chinaâs Xinhua news agency and Russiaâs RT outlet. Twitter said it was for accounts that are involved in geopolitics and diplomacy. Earlier this week, the BBC had its âgovernment-fundedâ label changed to âpublicly fundedâ. Twitter defines state-affiliated media as an âoutlet where the state exercises control over editorial contentâ. Government-funded media refers to outlets âwhere the government provides some or all of the outletâs funding and may have varying degrees of government involvement over editorial contentâ. Then there is publicly funded media, which refers to organisations that âreceive funding from licence fees, individual contributions, public financing, and commercial financingâ. A spokesperson said the ABC was not planning to follow NPR and PBS by quitting Twitter. âThe ABC doesnât currently have any plans to shut down all its Twitter accounts. Weâre liaising with Twitter regarding changes to account verification and labels,â they said. An SBS spokesperson said labelling the company âpublicly fundedâ would be more accurate. âWhile we appreciate Twitterâs motivations with regard to transparency on its platform, we believe a âpublicly funded mediaâ label better reflects the hybrid public-commercial nature of our funding model and the fact that SBS retains full independence from government in our news editorial and content decision-making,â they said. Both media companies maintain full editorial independence from government, as set out in their charters. Since Musk acquired Twitter, the platformâs value appears to have halved and he axed half the companyâs workforce. He has also come under fire for his plans to remove the blue ticks awarded to âauthenticâ accounts. There has also been some legal trouble, and a range of changes to how the site operates. Guardian Australia contacted Twitter for a comment and received what has been described as its âstandardâ response â a poop emoji.",Guardian,17/04/2023,Twitter labels Australiaâs ABC news and SBS âgovernment-funded mediaâ,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/17/twitter-labels-australias-abc-news-and-sbs-government-funded-media
15,"Since Elon Musk acquired Twitter for $44bn in October 2022, he has made erratic decisions and reduced the workforce by half. After an advertiser boycott, Twitter has lost more than $20bn in value and now has to pay off a $13bn debt burden. Last month, Twitter's worth was calculated to be less than half of what Musk paid for it. The site's infrastructure and staff have also caused problems, leading to NPR leaving the platform. However, Musk believes that Twitter has a chance to become cash flow positive this quarter and has folded the site into X Corp to develop an ""everything app"" akin to WeChat in China.","On 28 October 2022 Elon Musk tweeted âthe bird is freedâ as he marked his $44bn acquisition of Twitter. Nearly six months later, it became a dog. The distinctive avian logo the Tesla CEO had referenced in October had been replaced by a picture of a Shiba Inu canine â the face of the Dogecoin cryptocurrency. There was speculation over what was behind the change. Was it linked to a recent attempt to dismiss a $258bn lawsuit filed against Musk by Dogecoin investors over an alleged pyramid scheme? Was it a delayed April Foolâs gag? Whatever the reason, the dog has now gone. But the episode was exemplary of Muskâs decision-making style at the social media company: erratic, and sometimes, inscrutable in motivation. As we approach six months of Muskâs acquisition of Twitter, it remains far from business as usual at the company. In the past week alone, there has been a spat with Substack, further problems with the siteâs infrastructure and NPR, the US radio network, has quit the platform. Musk himself admitted in an interview with the BBC that running Twitter had been âpainfulâ and that buying it had come with âemotional strainâ. Hereâs a look at how key areas of Twitterâs business have performed. Debt and company value The end of the month does not just mark six months since Muskâs purchase, it is also the due date for the second quarterly instalment on paying down Twitterâs $13bn debt burden (a payment of about $300m). When the first payment approached in January, it was against a backdrop of doom-laden warnings from Musk, who had cautioned shortly after the takeover that âbankruptcy isnât out of the questionâ. True, Musk had paid $44bn for a business that had been largely loss-making since its launch in 2006. But his own decisions at the platform had led to an advertiser boycott that had caused significant damage to the platformâs main source of revenue (more than $5bn in 2021). Last month it emerged that Twitter is now worth less than half of what Musk paid for it, having lost more than $20bn (Â£16.4bn) in value, according to calculations based on a leaked memo. Financial performance Once at the helm, Musk slashed costs and, last month, the CEO said he thought Twitter had a chance of turning cashflow positive â broadly, spending less cash to run the business than it takes in â in the current quarter. He repeated the claim in the BBC interview. In March he told a Morgan Stanley conference in San Francisco that Twitterâs revenue was due to drop to less than $3bn this year but expenditure had dropped from $4.5bn to $1.5bn. Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, says Muskâs high-risk approach could pay off for a platform that was struggling for financial stability even before the chaotic takeover. âTwitter has always been a basket case as a business, unable to monetize its users into advertising revenues and the status quo was getting them nowhere,â he says. âMusk, as is his wont, has been a chaos agent, unfocused and unpredictable, but I would think that Twitter stands a chance of making it out of the forest, precisely because of this chaos.â Indeed, Musk recently folded Twitter into an entity called X Corp. Musk has referred to Twitter as being an âaccelerantâ for creating X, his âeverything appâ akin to WeChat in China. User base A self-declaredâfree speech absolutistâ, Musk early on chose to reinstate accounts that had been banned under the platformâs previous owners. Those included the accounts for Donald Trump, misogynist influencer Andrew Tate and the personal account of the far-right US congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. According to Musk, users have not fled the platform in response. Musk said in November that Twitterâs user numbers had crossed 250 million, up from 238 million before the takeover. The controversy around account reinstatement, the threat of losing blue-check status and Muskâs dislike of mainstream media, including banning some prominent reporters, also do not seem to have deterred the journalists and influential pundits who use the platform regularly (see the Gary Lineker tweet that drove a whole news cycle recently). âDespite all the talk that journalists would be leaving Twitter, in practice very few have done so because it remains an important part of workflows, with networks that have been built up and carefully curated over the years â as well as being a compelling and amusing distraction,â says Nic Newman, a senior research associate at the Reuters Institute for the Study Journalism. âOur data suggests that there has been no substantial drop-off in the number of people that use it weekly â though that may well come.â Staff In an effort to dramatically cut costs, Musk axed half of the companyâs 7,500-strong workforce within days of sealing the takeover and reduced it further through a series of cuts including a bizarre redundancy program where staff were asked to commit to being âhardcoreâ or leave. Such was the chaotic reaction to that ultimatum, Twitter was forced to shut offices temporarily. According to one former employee who was made redundant following the takeover, the platform has gone backwards. âFor many of us former tweeps, seeing what Musk is doing to Twitter is heartbreaking,â said the former staff member, speaking on condition of anonymity. âThe platform has regressed in terms of toxicity, safety and nuance. The hard work of dedicated teams and colleagues over the years has been erased, including efforts to combat misinformation and create trustworthy safety policies and curation standards.â Advertisers Concerns over Muskâs erratic decision making, approach to content moderation and a botched relaunch of Twitterâs Blue subscription service underlined Muskâs revenue projections last month. At one point in January, the companyâs daily revenue was down 40% year-over-year, according to the tech newsletter the Platformer and some boycotts remain in place. Pharmaceutical firms Eli Lilly and Pfizer, retailer Macyâs and Cadbury owner MondÄlez spent no money on Twitter in the first two months of the year, according to the advertising data firm MediaRadar. However, MediaRadar said there were 3,700 companies advertising on Twitter in February â 8% more than the same period last year (although some, like Volkswagen, General Motors and Chipotle, have reduced their spending significantly). Nonetheless, there are signs of life. âJust this past couple of weeks weâve seen the first signs of recovery, as a few advertisers are now talking about Twitter ads again,â says Farhad Divecha, the managing director of the UK digital marketing agency AccuraCast. âTheyâre now coming to us asking about it, rather than us asking them if theyâre ready to reconsider Twitter â and them declining. Twitter Blue relaunch Determined to reduce Twitterâs reliance on advertising, Musk has invested big in the relaunch of Twitterâs subscription services. The first relaunch of Twitter Blue, in November, was paused after it led to a slew of fake âverifiedâ accounts. The company tried again in December, offering subscribers perks such as a blue tick â giving your account more prominence on the For You feed â and fewer adverts for $8 a month on the web or $11 on iOS or Android. According to Travis Brown, a software developer who has been tracking Twitterâs subscription service, the new-look Blue has about 550-585,000 subscribers which equates to $4m+ a month in revenue. Twitter will need many more sign-ups to offset the advertising loss. Meanwhile, the 400,000 legacy blue checks face a loss of status. Musk told the BBC that these checks will be phased out by next week, although a deadline has been missed before. Site performance and regulators Twitter has been hit by a series of outages since it was bought. In the latest breach, users reported that Twitterâs privacy-friendly Circles feature was leaking private user data. The US Federal Trade Commission is investigating the company amid concerns that Twitterâs ability to protect users, and comply with a 2022 deal with the FTC to maintain high data security standards, might have been affected by redundancies and cost cuts. âThe FTCâs investigation is quite serious,â says David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. âThere is deep concern within the FTC as to whether Twitter is, in fact, making a concerted effort to bring it into compliance with the May 2022 consent decree.â Vladeck says that unless Twitter âups its gameâ another enforcement action, including âsubstantial civil penaltiesâ, looms.

16,"In an op-ed for The Guardian, John Naughton notes that despite Elon Musk's chaotic attempts to mould Twitter to his liking, mainstream media continues to be glued to the social media platform. Naughton argues that Twitter has become a significant part of the public sphere because it is an obsession for politicians, advertisers, PR and communications people, and journalists. He highlights that Twitter is the go-to platform to reach the widest possible audience, even though many users have moved to Mastodon, a decentralised federation of independently run servers. Naughton suggests that the world would miss Twitter if it disappeared, but ""we are stuck with it.""","Last October, the richest manchild in human history fell into the trap he had dug for himself. Elon Musk was forced to purchase Twitter at an absurd price. He had no clear idea of what to do with his new acquisition, other than realising a fatuous idea about âfree speechâ. It was like watching a monkey acquire a delicate clock: the new owner started thrashing wildly about, slashing the headcount (from 8,000 to about 1,500) â in the process losing many of the people who knew how the machine worked â and generally having tantrums while tweeting incontinently from the smallest room in the companyâs San Francisco headquarters. All of this frenetic activity was watched â and avidly reported for weeks â by the worldâs mainstream media, for reasons that would have puzzled a visiting Martian anthropologist. After all, in relation to the other social-media companies, Twitter looked like a minnow. Most people have never used it. So why all the fuss about its acquisition by a flake of Cadbury proportions? The answer is that there is a select category of humans who are obsessive users of Twitter: politicians; people who work in advertising, PR and âcommunicationsâ; and journalists. These are people who spend every waking moment on the platform, and use it to disseminate information, argue, troll, boast and engage in relentless virtue-signalling. Given that some (many?) of these people work in media, their obsession with Twitter meant that it had become, de facto, a significant part of the public sphere. If you wanted to be anyone in that networked world, you had to be on Twitter. The person who understood this best was Donald Trump, who was an inspired maestro of the medium. He campaigned on Twitter, and eventually even governed by tweet â to the extent that some genius created a bot that automatically reformatted every tweet Trump issued as president as an official-looking White House press statement. When Musk embarked on his chaotic attempts to mould the platform to his liking, there was a stampede of advertisers and disaffected users from it. The former sat on their corporate hands, worried about brands being tainted by the racist and xenophobic hordes that Musk allowed on to the platform; the latter went to Mastodon which, though superficially similar to Twitter, is actually very different â itâs a decentralised federation of independently run servers. Mastodon is fine for some purposes. For one thing, itâs somehow quieter and more conversational. For another, itâs not algorithmically curated, so you only see posts from people you have chosen to follow. And though it does have some journalists on it, most of them seem to have hedged their bets â in that they have also remained on Twitter. And I can see why: if you are interested in reaching the widest possible audience for your humblebragging or even news of your latest scoop, then â because of its decentralised architecture â Mastodon doesnât have the âreachâ that you crave. Which means that, no matter how depraved Twitter becomes under its reigning proprietor, you have to be there, even if he despises you. Which he does. After he fired all the companyâs press team, for example, replies to media inquiries consist of an automated poo emoji. So, as tech journalist Casey Newton observes in âWhy journalists canât quit Twitterâ: âThe company was symbolically shitting all over them, and journalists couldnât get enough of it.â Which brings us, oddly enough, to the UK and Keir Starmerâs Labour party, which is suddenly displaying a perceptive understanding of how to use Twitter for political purposes. Exhibit A is a Labour advertisement that everybody in politics has been talking about for at least a week: a photograph of Rishi Sunak accompanying the text: âDo you think adults convicted of sexually assaulting children should go to prison? Rishi Sunak doesnât.â Under the Tories, the ad continued, â4,500 adults convicted of sexually assaulting children under 16 served no prison time.â The interesting thing is that the advert was posted only on the partyâs Twitter feed â and not on Facebook or other social media sites that account for the majority of party-political online advertising in the run-up to elections. The ad was seen by more than 22 million people â in itself a formidable achievement in a world where most people pay no attention to politics. But more importantly, it was seen by every journalist in the country, which is why so many people have been talking about it ever since. All of which suggests that unless Musk succeeds in actually demolishing his new toy, mainstream media will continue to be glued to it. None of the available alternatives look like a convincing replacement for it. And yet itâs clear that the world would miss Twitter if it disappeared. So maybe, as with death and taxes, we are stuck with it.

This move came after National Public Radio also left the platform amid comments by Twitter owner Elon Musk that NPR was ""state-affiliated media"" that should be defunded. Twitter has since relabeled NPR as ""government-funded media,"" but the labels were criticized by the two organizations as undermining their credibility as independent news outlets. PBS spokesperson Jason Phelps said that the platform's simplistic label leaves the inaccurate impression that PBS is wholly funded by the federal government.","The USâs Public Broadcasting Service, better known as PBS, has quit its use of Twitter after the platform labeled the organization as âgovernment-funded mediaâ. PBSâs announced its Twitter exit on Thursday, one day after National Public Radio also left the platform amid comments by the Twitter owner, Elon Musk, that NPR was âstate-affiliated mediaâ which should be defunded. Twitter has since relabeled NPR as âgovernment-funded mediaâ, but that did not stop the radio broadcaster saying that the labels for it and the television broadcaster PBS were aimed at undermining their credibility as independent news outlets. The labels are shared by Russia Today and Chinaâs Xinhua, whose editorial decisions are heavily influenced by their respective state regimes, as USA Today noted. Meanwhile, both NPR and PBS fall in the middle â or neutral â part of the Ad Fontes media bias chart. A PBS spokesperson said the broadcaster does receive some government subsidies but gets far more from members of the public and from philanthropic organizations. While it does receive government subsidies, NPR says most of its funding comes from corporate as well as individual supporters and grants. United Press International noted Twitter has not labeled the accounts for the Musk-owned SpaceX and Tesla companies as government-affiliated organizations despite receiving billions in government subsidies. In a statement to USA Today, Jason Phelps of PBS said the broadcasterâs staffers stopped using the organizationâs Twitter account after learning that the platform had relabeled them. Phelps said PBS had âno plans to resume at this timeâ but added that the organization was âcontinuing to monitor the ever-changing situation closelyâ. âTwitterâs simplistic label leaves the inaccurate impression that PBS is wholly funded by the federal government,â Phelps added to USA Today. In a separate statement, PBS said that âeditorial independence is central to our work, and will never changeâ. âWe will continue to produce trustworthy content that features unbiased reporting and holds governments and institutions to account,â the PBS spokespersonâs statement added. The BBC was also recently labeled government-funded media by Twitter, but the platform relabeled it âpublicly fundedâ after the BBC complained. The BBC remains on Twitter. UK households fund the BBC through a TV license fee, and commercial operations also provide income to the broadcaster, which operates through a royal charter with the British government that requires the broadcaster to be independent.",Guardian,14/04/2023,PBS quits Twitter after being labeled âgovernment-funded mediaâ,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/14/pbs-quits-twitter-government-funded-media-label-npr
18,"National Public Radio (NPR) and public TV broadcaster PBS have stopped posting fresh content on Twitter after the social media platform labeled them as ""state-affiliated media."" Twitter has since changed the label to ""government-funded media."" The move prompted responses from journalists and the Committee to Protect Journalists, which called on Twitter to reconsider its decision, highlighting the potential risks of negative connotations for journalists reporting from areas where government affiliation could be suggested. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also objected to Twitter's labeling of it as ""government-funded media"" and Musk said Twitter would change the label to ""publicly funded.""","National Public Radio (NPR) said on Wednesday it will no longer post fresh content to its 52 official Twitter feeds after the US organization was labeled as âstate-affiliated mediaâ by the social media platform. âWe are officially de-emphasizing Twitter across the organization,â NPR said in a statement, adding that it had made the decision after Twitter refused repeated requests to remove the âinaccurate labelâ. Public TV broadcaster PBS also suspended tweets, citing the same reason. A PBS spokesman, Jeremy Gaines, told the Washington Post: âWe donât have any plans to return.â The broadcaster did not immediately respond to the Guardianâs request for a comment. Twitter labeled both public media organizations as âstate-affiliated mediaâ before changing the wording to âgovernment-funded mediaâ. The BBC and Voice of America were also tagged. Twitter was not immediately available for comment. Before a takeover of Twitter by Elon Musk, the label was reserved for propaganda networks like Russiaâs RT and Chinaâs Xinhua News Agency. NPR is a non-profit media organization, based in Washington, that syndicates more than 1,000 local public radio stations across the US. Some public radio stations â including KCRW in Santa Monica, California, and WESA in Pittsburgh â also announced they would stop using the platform, though affiliated member stations were not tagged as âgovernment fundedâ. The majority of NPRâs funding comes from corporate and individual supporters and grants. The organization also receives programming fees from various member stations. The member stations receive about 13% of their funds from the federally funded Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other state and federal government sources, NPR said. âThe whole point isnât whether or not weâre government funded,â said the organizationâs CEO, John Lansing. âEven if we were government funded, which weâre not, the point is the independence, because all journalism has revenue of some sort.â Lansing echoed his message in a staff-wide email, saying: âIt would be a disservice to the serious work you all do here to continue to share it on a platform that is associating the federal charter for public media with an abandoning of editorial independence or standards.â The organization is setting up a two-week grace period so social media managers that run its accounts can revise their social media strategies. According to Lansing, NPR staff can decide for themselves whether they will continue remaining active on the platform. The organizationâs decision has prompted a slew of responses online, including from its own journalists. Scott Detrow, NPRâs White House correspondent, wrote: âNPR is stepping away from Twitter. Itâs the right move and Iâm proud of us for taking it.â Geoff Brumfiel, an editor and correspondent on NPRâs science desk, tweeted: âTwitter doesnât make or break anything we do as an organization, and so thereâs not much benefit for staying.â Meanwhile, the Committee to Protect Journalists has called on Twitter to reconsider its decision, with its program director, Carlos MartÃ­nez de la Serna, saying âit is imperativeâ. âNPR receives public funding, but is not state-controlled, meaning Twitterâs listing could pose risks for journalists reporting from areas where suggestions of government affiliation have negative connotations,â he said. Barry Malone, the deputy editor in chief of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, tweeted: âNPR leaves Twitter â the first major media org to do so. An influential newsroom with almost 9 million followers. Hard not to interpret this as a big blow to the platform.â The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) had also objected to Twitter labeling it as âgovernment-funded mediaâ on the companyâs main account. Elon Musk, Twitterâs billionaire owner, said the social media platform will now change the BBCâs label after the broadcaster objected. In an interview with the BBC, Musk said he had the âutmost respectâ for the outlet. âWe want [the tag] as truthful and accurate as possible. Weâre adjusting the label to [the BBC being] publicly funded. Weâll try to be accurate,â he added. The Tesla, Twitter and SpaceX chief made the announcement during a wide-ranging interview with the BBC in which he said that his pain level from running the site had been âextremely highâ but that the business was now âroughly breaking evenâ.",Guardian,12/04/2023,NPR to quit Twitter after being labelled âstate-affiliated mediaâ,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/12/npr-leaves-twitter-elon-musk-state-media
19,"Australia's eSafety commissioner used its new cyber abuse powers for the first time to compel Twitter to remove severely harmful content targeting Brittany Higgins and her partner, David Sharaz. The commissioner issued a formal notice to Twitter to remove the content, which exemplified the widespread abuse and harassment the pair have suffered online. The laws allow the commissioner to compel major social media platforms to remove material deemed to be severe ""cyber-abuse material targeted at an Australian adult"". The commissioner has used these powers six times since they were enacted, resulting in the removal of material or geo-blocking the content.","Australiaâs eSafety commissioner deployed tough new cyber abuse powers for the first time to force Twitter to remove severely harmful content targeting Brittany Higgins and her partner, David Sharaz, last year. Sharaz lodged a formal complaint to the office of eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, in April last year, asking for an investigation of vitriolic content that Twitter was refusing to act upon, according to correspondence seen by Guardian Australia. His complaint singled out a highly offensive tweet â which the Guardian has chosen not to republish â that exemplified the widespread abuse and harassment the pair have suffered online. The commissioner acted quickly in response and intervened using new adult cyber abuse powers to issue a formal notice to Twitter to remove the content. It was the first time the eSafety commissioner had issued such a notice since the Online Safety Act was enacted in January 2022. The laws allow the commissioner to compel major social media platforms to remove material her office deems to be severe âcyberâabuse material targeted at an Australian adultâ. The powers can only be used where a platform has refused to act on content that an ordinary person would believe was âintended to have an effect of causing serious harm to a particular Australian adultâ and would âregard the material as being, in all the circumstances, menacing, harassing or offensiveâ. Upon receipt of the notice, Twitter took down the abusive tweet within 24 hours. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The eSafety commissioner said it could not comment on individual complaints, but its intervention, until then unprecedented, shows the seriousness of the abuse directed at Higgins and Sharaz. A spokesperson for the commissioner said more generally that it had only used the powers six times since they were enacted roughly one year ago. In each of the six cases, the commissionerâs intervention had resulted in either the removal of material or geo-blocking the content. âThe adult cyber abuse scheme gives Australian adults somewhere to turn if an online service provider has failed to act on a report of seriously harmful online abuse,â a spokesperson said. âAdult cyber abuse can have a long-lasting impact on the targeted personâs sense of safety, self-esteem, mental health and physical wellbeing, especially when part of a broader pattern of abuse and harassment.â The reforms enacted last year also gave the eSafety commissioner broader powers to act on cyberbullying. Inman Grant, the eSafety commissioner, has previously told the Guardian that her agency had probed more than 1,680 cyberbullying complaints and made more than 500 removal requests to online platforms in the first 12 months since the Online Safety Act changes. Bruce Lehrmannâs defamation proceedings against News Corp and Network Ten are set to be brought back to the federal court on 28 April for a key ruling that will determine whether his case can proceed. Lehrmann is seeking to extend the usual 12-month time limit that applies to defamation proceedings so that he can sue News Corp and Network Ten for their initial reporting of Higginsâ allegations of rape â allegations he has always denied. At a hearing last month, Lehrmann argued that he was delayed in bringing proceedings due to prior legal advice, the prospect of a criminal trial and his mental health. But lawyers for News Corp, Network Ten, Samantha Maiden and Lisa Wilkinson argued it was not reasonable for Lehrmann to have delayed the proceedings, saying he did nothing, despite being âacutely awareâ that he was in a position to sue for defamation. Justice Michael Lee will hand down his decision at midday on 28 April. Lehrmann pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual intercourse without consent. His first trial in the ACT supreme court was aborted due to juror misconduct, and prosecutors did not proceed with a retrial due to fears over Higginsâs mental health.",Guardian,11/04/2023,Twitter forced to remove harmful content aimed at Brittany Higgins and partner,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/12/twitter-forced-to-remove-harmful-content-aimed-at-brittany-higgins-and-partner
20,"Twitter and Substack have ended a six-day row after Twitter stopped censoring links and searches for the newsletter platform. The row began when Substack announced a new feature called Substack Notes, which offers a Twitter-like experience for the companys user base of newsletter authors and their readers, some of whom are paying subscribers. Many Substack authors rely on Twitter for both reader acquisition and content to write about. The spat also appeared to have put an end to Elon Musks Twitter Files project, after he tweeted then deleted screenshots of a conversation between himself and one of its writers, Matt Taibbi, in which the pair sparred over the censorship.","A six-day row between Twitter and Substack has come to an uneasy truce after the social media site stopped censoring links and searches for the newsletter platform following the latterâs decision to launch a rival microblogging service. However, the spat appears to have put an end to Elon Muskâs âTwitter Filesâ project, after he tweeted then deleted screenshots of a conversation between himself and one of its writers, Matt Taibbi, in which the pair sparred over the censorship. The conflict started last Wednesday, when Substack announced a new feature, âSubstack Notesâ, which offers a Twitter-like experience for the companyâs user base of newsletter authors and their readers, some of whom are paying subscribers. âWhile Notes may look like familiar social media feeds, the key difference is in what you donât see,â said the Substack cofounder Hamish McKenzie in a post announcing the feature. âThe Substack network runs on paid subscriptions, not ads. This changes everything. âHere, people get rewarded for respecting the trust and attention of their audiences. The ultimate goal on this platform is to convert casual readers into paying subscribers. âIn this system, the vast majority of the financial rewards go to the creators of the content.â Many Substack authors rely on Twitter for both reader acquisition and content to write about, leaving the newsletter platform in a painful position if Muskâs chaotic administration of Twitter since his $44bn (Â£38bn) takeover last October were to lead to the social networkâs collapse. Even before the Twitter sale, Substack had been struggling: the companyâs 2021 revenues were negative, according to its financial statements, and it lost $25m in cash overall that year. Last year, it fired one in six staff members and last month it turned to retail investors for a fundraising round, despite having been valued at $650m in March 2021. In a statement, the company denied it was in difficulty, telling the Guardian: âThe financials shared are nearly 18 months old, and the company has transformed materially since then. âIn the period 2020 to 2022, Substack focused on growth. In particular, during this period we made aggressive investments to acquire writers who had large readerships so we could kickstart the growth of the Substack network. This effort brought tens of millions of readers into the system. Now, Substack has more than 35 million active subscriptions, including 2 million paid subscriptions. More than 17,000 people are earning money on Substack, and the top 10 writers earn more than $25 million.â But the companyâs efforts to compete with Twitter brought an immediate response from Musk himself. Over the Easter weekend, any tweet containing a Substack link was algorithmically deprioritised, blocked from being liked or retweeted, and hidden in search. Searches for the term âsubstackâ itself were automatically replaced with searches for the word ânewsletterâ. And many users who did manage to find and click on a link to a Substack site reported being warned by Twitter that the service was âunsafe or maliciousâ. âWeâre disappointed that Twitter has chosen to restrict writersâ ability to share their work,â the Substack founders said in a joint statement. âTheir livelihoods should not be tied to platforms where they donât own their relationship with their audience, and where the rules can change on a whim.â Taibbi, one of the most prominent writers on Substack, found himself in the middle of that conflict. Despite working closely with Musk on the Twitter Files â a selective publication of internal Twitter documents authorised by Musk with the apparent goal of demonstrating liberal bias under its former management â he said he would be leaving the platform over the restrictions. That departure prompted a response from Musk, the companyâs first public statement on the matter, days after the first reprisals against Substack had been noticed: Musk falsely accused Taibbi of being a Substack employee (he is not), claimed Substack links âwere never blockedâ (he later admitted they were temporarily marked as âunsafeâ), and accused Substack of âtrying to download a massive portion of the Twitter database to bootstrap their Twitter cloneâ, which Substackâs chief executive has denied in a post on Substack Notes. The spat appears to be distracting Musk from more pressing concerns at the social network. Over the weekend, users reported that the companyâs privacy-focused Circles feature was leaking private user data. Similar to Instagramâs Close Friends feature, posts shared to a Twitter Circle are supposed to be shown only to other users who have been explicitly added to that Circle. But multiple users, including security researcher Ian Coldwater, found that other users were able to see their supposedly secret posts. âI made a Twitter Circle with one person in it,â Coldwater said. âTwo people I donât follow saw the tweet &amp; liked it. One of those people doesnât follow me either. Twitter Circles arenât private. Donât post anything you want private in them.â A request for comment to Twitter was unanswered, save for the companyâs automatic reply to all press inquiries: a poo emoji. â¢ This article was amended on 12 April 2023 to add a statement from Substack that was provided after publication.",Guardian,11/04/2023,Row between Twitter and Substack ends with uneasy truce,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/11/row-between-twitter-and-substack-ends-with-uneasy-truce

Elon Musk praised the BBC as one of the least biased media organizations after the broadcaster objected to being labeled as ""government-funded media"" on Twitter. The BBC asserted its independence, stating it is funded by the British public through the license fee. Musk called for transparency and acknowledged that all organizations have bias to some extent. Twitter also labeled America's NPR as ""state-affiliated media,"" but later changed it to ""government-funded media"" following objections.","Elon Musk has described the BBC as âamong the least biasedâ media organisations after the broadcaster objected to being labelled as âgovernment-funded mediaâ on Twitter. The BBC contacted Twitter after the designation was attached to the main @BBC account. The label links through to a page on Twitterâs help centre that says âstate-affiliated mediaâ are outlets where the government âexercises control over editorial contentâ in various ways. The BBC added in its statement: âThe BBC is, and always has been, independent. We are funded by the British public through the licence fee.â Since 1927, the BBC has operated through a Royal Charter agreed with the government that states the corporation âmust be independentâ, particularly over âeditorial and creative decisions, the times and manner in which its output and services are supplied, and in the management of its affairsâ. Britons pay a Â£159 licence fee each year to fund the corporationâs output. The fee is set by government but paid by individual households. Responding to the complaint, Musk asked: âIs the Twitter label accurate?â In an email to the BBC, he wrote: âWe are aiming for maximum transparency and accuracy. Linking to ownership and source of funds probably makes sense. âI do think media organisations should be self-aware and not falsely claim the complete absence of bias. All organisations have bias, some obviously much more than others. âI should note that I follow BBC news on Twitter, because I think it is among the least biased.â While the @BBC account concerned, which has 2.2 million followers, has been given the label, more popular accounts affiliated to the broadcasterâs news and sport output, including BBC News (World) and BBC Breaking News, are not being described in the same way. Twitter also designated Americaâs National Public Radio (NPR) as âstate-affiliated mediaâ, a label given to outlets including Russiaâs RT and Chinaâs Xinhua News. The description was later changed to the same âgovernment funded mediaâ tag now applied to the @BBC account. NPR â which receives some money from public institutions but whose funding mainly comes from sources such as corporate sponsorships and membership fees â had said it would stop tweeting from the account unless it was amended.

22,"Twitter is facing accusations of yielding to government pressure in India by blocking numerous journalists, politicians, and activists from its platform. The Indian government demanded the removal of accounts following an internet shutdown in Punjab. Twitter complied and blocked over 120 accounts, including those of prominent figures. Critics argue that this demonstrates a crackdown on dissent and a threat to civil liberties. Elon Musk, Twitter's owner, acknowledged the issue but stated he cannot fix it immediately. India poses significant challenges for Twitter, with concerns about censorship and authoritarianism growing.


","Twitter has been accused of bowing to government pressure in India by blocking scores of prominent journalists, politicians and activists from its platform in recent weeks. The Indian government issued notices to Twitter to remove people in the aftermath of an internet shutdown in Punjab during the search for a fugitive Sikh separatist leader. Twitter agreed to block more than 120 accounts, including the Canadian politician Jagmeet Singh, the Canadian poet Rupi Kaur, several journalists and an Indian MP. Twitter also blocked the handle of the BBCâs Punjabi bureau. Jaskaran Sandhu, the Toronto-based co-founder of Baaz News, an outlet focused on the Sikh diaspora, received an email from Twitter on 21 March that said his account had been withheld in India. In the email, seen by the Guardian, no specific tweet or activity by Sandhu was cited by Twitter for its action. âThe Indian government has made it a norm to take draconian measures and crack down on dissent coming from Sikh or other minority communities,â Sandhu said. âTwitterâs actions are just another example [that imply] civil liberties and democratic rights are under attack.â âMy entire account, not any tweet, has been banned in India. It is blanket censorship. And there is absolute silence from Twitter on this.â Freedom House, a US-based nonprofit organisation, has accused the prime minister Narendra Modiâs government of âdriving India toward authoritarianismâ and in 2021 downgraded Indiaâs status from âfreeâ to âpartly freeâ. India, the third-largest market for Twitter after the US and Japan, is proving to be one of its biggest challenges. Responding to a tweet about censorship in India, Elon Musk, who completed a takeover of Twitter in October and calls himself a âfree speech absolutistâ, tweeted: âIt is not possible for me to fix every aspect of Twitter worldwide overnight, while still running Tesla and SpaceX, among other things.â Social media platforms including Twitter had been seen as one of the remaining avenues for Indian people to express dissent, after traditional media houses largely caved in to pressure from the government to toe its line. Twitter sued the government in July over takedown orders, after the government introduced legislation in 2021 aimed at regulating every form of digital content, including online news, social media, and streaming platforms and empowering itself to remove content it deemed âobjectionableâ. Prateek Waghre, the policy director of the Internet Freedom Foundation, said much of the content being withheld was reportage that did not portray the government in a positive light. âThere is no contention. It is just absurd,â he added. Since his takeover, Musk has reportedly slashed Twitterâs workforce by 90% in India. âThere is a question if Twitter still has people to vet these requests,â Waghre said. âThe question is also on the willingness of a pushback, which has certainly reduced [since Musk takeover].â Raqib Hameed Naik, the founder of Hindutva Watch, a US-based site that tracks hate crimes in India, described the situation as âvery grimâ. âBig tech has completely surrendered to the authoritarian regime of PM Narendra Modi,â he said. âTwitterâs conduct in India sets a worrying trend of silencing media, critics and dissenters worldwide.â Sandhu said he was not optimistic about Indiaâs ability to âuphold minimal requirements for a healthy democracyâ, describing the system as ârotten to the coreâ.",Guardian,5/04/2023,Twitter accused of censorship in India as it blocks Modi critics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/05/twitter-accused-of-censorship-in-india-as-it-blocks-modi-critics-elon-musk
23,"Twitter changed its blue bird logo to a dog meme associated with Dogecoin, but Elon Musk, the owner, provided no explanation. Speculations arose about it being an April Fool's prank or a distraction from a lawsuit against Musk by Dogecoin investors. The lawsuit claims Musk manipulated the cryptocurrency's value for profit. Dogecoin's value surged after Musk's announcement about Tesla merchandise. Twitter's worth has reportedly decreased, and it has yet to remove blue ticks for verified users as promised.


","Almost 24 hours after Twitter changed its blue bird logo to a badly cut-out image of a dog meme made famous by cryptocurrencies, the companyâs billionaire owner, Elon Musk, has still offered no explanation or justification for the change. On Monday, US time, users noted that the blue bird logo on Twitterâs homepage and loading screen had been replaced with the shiba inu image associated with the Dogecoin memecoin cryptocurrency. For hours, neither Twitter nor Musk even acknowledged the change. Adding to the confusion was an apparently unrelated bug that surfaced at the same time, one of an increasing number in Twitterâs user interface, which removed the ability to tell which tweets had been retweeted on to your timeline. In typical Musk fashion, he eventually tweeted a meme noting the change, and followed up with the closest to an explanation he has proffered: a callback to a joke a follower made in March 2022 suggesting that he should buy Twitter and replace the logo with Doge. The official Dogecoin account tweeted in response: âVery currency. Wow. Much Coin. How Money. So Crypto.â An email requesting comment from Twitterâs press office received only the automatic response, a single poo emoji, that has sufficed for Twitterâs public relations operation since late March. Some users speculated it was meant to be an April foolâs day gag that the company was unable to bring in on time on 1 April. Others wondered if it was an effort to flood out news of a court case against Musk. The change came just days after Musk petitioned a court in the US to dismiss a lawsuit filed against him by Dogecoin investors for $258bn over an alleged pyramid scheme. Reuters reported in June last year that according to the complaint, the plaintiffs claim Musk knew that since 2019 the cryptocurrency had no value, but promoted Dogecoin to profit from its trading. âMusk used his pedestal as worldâs richest man to operate and manipulate the Dogecoin Pyramid Scheme for profit, exposure and amusement,â the complaint reportedly stated. The plaintiffs reportedly complained the sell-off of Dogecoin began when Musk appeared on Saturday Night Live and referred to Dogecoin as a âhustleâ in a segment. Lawyers for Musk and Tesla have called the lawsuitâs allegations a âfanciful work of fictionâ over Muskâs âinnocuous and often silly tweetsâ about Dogecoin. The value of Dogecoin jumped last year after Musk announced Tesla merchandise could be bought using it. On Twitterâs logo changing, Dogecoinâs value jumped from US$0.079 to US$0.094, the highest value the currency has been since November last year. Twitter is now worth less than $20bn, according to a leaked internal memo, under half what Musk paid for it six months ago. Despite promising to remove legacy blue ticks for verified users from 1 April, the site has only so far removed the tick for the New York Timesâs main Twitter account.",Guardian,4/04/2023,Twitter makes unexplained logo change to Dogecoin cryptocurrency image,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/04/twitter-changes-logo-to-dogecoin-cryptocurrency-image-in-apparent-late-april-fools-day-gag
24,"Twitter has not removed blue ticks from legacy verified users as announced by Elon Musk. The New York Times' blue tick was removed after they declined to pay for the service, leading to speculation of retaliation. Twitter removed the information distinguishing legacy verified accounts from Twitter Blue subscribers. Musk mentioned adding a verified date only for subscribers. Twitter's worth has reportedly decreased to less than $20bn, and the platform no longer has a communications department.


","Twitter has so far not followed through on an announcement that it would remove blue ticks from legacy verified users, meaning those users continue to display them alongside paying subscribers. Last month, Twitterâs billionaire owner, Elon Musk, announced that from 1 April, legacy verified users would have their blue ticks removed from the service unless they paid the US$8 a month subscription fee for Twitter Blue. For organisations, the fee is US$1,000 a month. As April foolâs day came and passed, the blue ticks remained, despite much anticipation. As of Sunday, Musk appears to have only removed one blue tick: that for the account of the New York Times. This appears to have been done in retaliation for the news outlet announcing it would not pay for the service, according to a reply from Musk. The New York Times also reportedly told reporters that it would not reimburse their costs for subscribing to Twitter Blue, except where it may be needed for their reporting. The Times had reported that Twitter would keep the verification badge for the 10,000 most followed organisations, which would include the Times with nearly 55m followers. The Washington Post reported on Friday that the removal of legacy verification badges may take a long time because the process may require a lot of manual elements. On Sunday, Twitter also removed the information that differentiated between legacy verified accounts and Twitter Blue subscribers, with users told when clicking the tick that the account is âverified because itâs subscribed to Twitter Blue or is a legacy verified account.â Users that had subscribed to the service had sometimes found themselves ridiculed on the platform for paying for the account, and Twitter was reportedly also mulling an option for subscribers to hide their verified badges. Musk on Sunday said Twitter would also add a verified date to a userâs account, but this would only apply to subscribers. Last week Musk backed down on a plan to only promote verified users through the companyâs âFor Youâ timeline that is algorithmically curated, stating other users would be visible as well in that feed. A leaked memo from Musk last week also revealed Twitter is worth less than half what the billionaire paid for it six months ago, down to less than US$20bn.

The New York Times has called it âsprawling and ambitiousâ¦ strange and dystopianâ. Lacey, one of Grantaâs best young American novelists in 2017, was speaking from her home in Brooklyn. Which part of the book came first: the alternate history or the fake biography? I liked the idea of writing a fake biography and the biographies I like best are usually written by someone with some kind of compromised perspective. I thought the worst person to write a biography would be a surviving spouse with a bit of a grudge, but I didnât want to get into the heterosexual dynamics of a man writing about a woman or a woman writing about a man; it had to be two women. At the same time, I wanted the novel to be set in the mid-20th century but I wasnât interested in writing about the actual struggles a prominent lesbian couple would have gone through in that time. So my alternate history grew out of that problem. I thought, if I have an America where this female artist could exist and this couple could exist without having to justify themselves, I just need a totally different America. As a workaround, it hardly cut corners. I liked that! I started the novel in 2016 at the same time that I was writing Pew, which takes place in a week and was so spare. Iâd decided to make myself write Pew quickly to see what would happen; I found that I can do it, I just prefer not to. Biography of X was more a kind of collecting project that I knew would take longer. Where do the various photographs of X come from? A lot of them I found in junk shops; for the images of her books, I commissioned jackets from a book designer. Why did you include real names from the art and book world? I saw it as another tool to make the novel as much like a biography as possible. Thereâs a quote [used in the book] from the New Yorker critic Merve Emre that is actually something she wrote about a Susan Sontag biography. There are a lot of names in there. A lot of them I made up. Like the critic âRichard Cuskâ. His quote is from Rachel Cuskâs essay on Celia Paul, about being female and making art. It was full of insights related to what I was writing, but by the time I set up the novelâs world I knew the essay would have to be flipped into a man arguing for his right to make art. Why does the story stop short of the 21st century? My fiction has never actively involved cellphones or the internet. Itâs too big; I canât get near it. The internet Iâm still on mentally is the more isolated, late 90s internet that was about weird web design and play. It wasnât that constant nervous Twitter energy, which repels me. I do use cellphones and the internet â Iâm not off in a cabin â but theyâre a plot killer. Did you have qualms about portraying the American south as a separatist theocracy? Itâs an exaggerated nightmare of what could have happened to that part of the country. I didnât want a cheap shot. Iâm southern. I grew up in Mississippi and then in Tennessee and my whole family still lives in Mississippi. I donât want to be one of those people who dismisses Mississippi as full of ignorant racists, because itâs not. The culture I grew up in is the reason I write. I think for a lot of writers coming out of the south itâs a very complicated place. Itâs America magnified: everything problematic about America just made really big. What draws you to characters who find it so hard simply to exist? I think itâs reacting to my very biblical childhood. Itâs not a conscious thing: âOh, Iâll insert a character that refuses identity or has difficulty with a fundamental aspect of their existence.â I think itâs just what happens when you leave a religion. Part of you is always going to ask: âWhy? Why any of this?â Not many of the people I grew up with have left the south and most of the ones who go to church take a soft view of their own belief: âMaybe thereâs a god, maybe there isnât; it doesnât really matter, I just like going to church.â I could never be that way; the minute I didnât believe, I couldnât go. Name a (real) biography you admire. Joshua Rivkinâs Chalk: The Art and Erasure of Cy Twombly. While he was writing it the estate decided they didnât want him to do it and started making his life very difficult. So halfway through the biography his attempt to write the book becomes part of the story. He gets at something of Twomblyâs life and work and the way people respond to it. I broke down looking at his last painting at the Twombly museum in Houston. Most Twombly fans â and Iâd put myself in this category â have some very extreme response to his work that feels mysterious. What else have you enjoyed reading recently? My Life by Lyn Hejinian: a strange, amazing memoir. Last summer, I was staying with a friend who had it in her house. I picked it up one morning and read it all that day. I used to be very rigid about what I read and when; I used to have a schedule, almost. But I find Iâm much happier when I just let books sort of stumble into my life. â¢ Biography of X is published on 6 April by Granta (Â£18.99).

26,"The article highlights the coincidental timing of legal verdicts involving former President Donald Trump's indictment over hush money payments and Gwyneth Paltrow's courtroom win in a ski accident case. Twitter users reacted with mixed emotions, with some finding humor and others noting the scripted-like nature of the events. Speculation arose about the celebrities' reactions to sharing the spotlight.


","An ex-president indicted for alleged hush money payments to a porn star. A wealthy actor and wellness guru vindicated in a nail-biting fight for justice against a retired optometrist. And all in the space of a few hours. The reaction on Twitter was clear: God bless America. Social media was quick to flood with users highlighting the remarkable timing of the verdicts. First came the supposedly untouchable Donald Trump, who was indicted by a New York grand jury over an alleged hush money payment made to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election. Less than two hours later, in a Utah courtroom, a jury sided with Gwyneth Paltrow, finding her not at fault for a ski accident with Terry Sanderson at a posh mountain resort, and awarding her $1 in compensation. Trump, whose other accomplishments include trying to overturn a legitimate election and seeking political counsel from a pillow salesman, will soon be fingerprinted and processed for a felony arrest â marking a first for a US president. Paltrow, a Hollywood nepo baby turned orgasm-candle salesperson, captivated onlookers during a weighty civil suit, which offered a rare glimpse into what itâs like to be absurdly rich. Some Twitter users reacted with pure, unfiltered joy. Others remarked that a better afternoon of legal drama couldnât have been scripted for television. The timing also led to speculation about how the two celebrities might feel about sharing the spotlight.",Guardian,31/03/2023,"Trump loses, Paltrow wins: Twitter marks a historic afternoon for America",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/30/twitter-trump-indictment-paltrow-verdict
27,"Twitter has reversed its decision to limit the ""for you"" timeline to paying subscribers only, following backlash. Elon Musk, the owner, stated that he had ""forgotten"" to mention that other users would still be visible. The move was initially aimed at addressing AI bot swarms. Musk has been concerned about spam accounts, even before acquiring Twitter. Plans to introduce paid-only voting in polls are still underway, but there is no confirmation of Musk stepping down as head of the company.","Twitter has reversed course on plans to limit presence on its âfor youâ timeline to paying users only, with Elon Musk claiming he âforgot to mentionâ that other users would be visible as well. When the companyâs owner first announced the plan on Tuesday he said it would limit the tab that algorithmically curates tweets for users to only display accounts who had paid Â£8 a month for âTwitter Blueâ and linked their account to a working phone number. Musk said restricting it to those subscribers, who will be the only âverifiedâ users on the site after Twitter closes its âlegacyâ verification program on Saturday, was âthe only realistic way to address advanced AI bot swarms taking overâ. The announcement was met with a backlash from many users, however, and later that day Musk said in a second tweet: âForgot to mention that accounts you follow directly will also be in For You, since you have explicitly asked for them.â Since its launch under Musk, as a rebranded version of the pre-existing ârecommendedâ feed, the for you tab has proved controversial. It is more aggressively curated than its predecessor, regularly inserting tweets from accounts the user does not follow, and has a noted predilection for pushing tweets from a small number of prominent accounts into as many feeds as possible: such as Menswear commentator @dieworkwear, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro and almost every public post from Musk himself. The stated rationale for limiting the for you tab to paid accounts only was to prevent âbot swarmsâ from dominating it. Musk has been focused on the prominence of automated spam accounts since before he even bought the site, citing spam as one of the key reasons why he wanted to acquire it, and later citing the same spam as one of the reasons he should be allowed to renege on the deal. However, his focus stepped into a higher gear in late December, after he posted a âbindingâ poll to ask whether he should step down as the head of the company. Within 24 hours, more than 10 million users had voted in favour of him resigning, 57.5% of the overall votes. The following day, Musk broke his silence only to tweet the word âinterestingâ to several suggestions that the results of the poll were skewed by fake accounts, and to agree with a suggestion that only paid-for accounts should be able to vote in polls. That policy is on track to be introduced on 15 April, Musk said in a tweet on Tuesday. Musk has yet to confirm any plans to step down as head of the company.",Guardian,29/03/2023,Twitter to no longer only promote paid-for accounts after backlash,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/29/twitter-to-no-longer-only-promote-paid-for-accounts-after-backlash-elon-musk
28,"Twitter's owner and CEO, Elon Musk, announced that the platform's ""For you"" feed will exclusively promote tweets from verified accounts who pay the Â£8 monthly subscription fee, starting from April 15. Musk claims it's necessary to combat AI bot swarms. Poll voting will also require verification. Existing ""legacy verified"" users will lose their badges unless they subscribe. Special privileges remain for a selected list of 35 VIP users, including Musk, to reassure him of algorithmic changes not affecting his reach.


","Twitterâs feed will promote only the tweets of users paying its Â£8 monthly subscription service, Elon Musk, the siteâs owner and chief executive, has tweeted. From 15 April, the âFor youâ tab on the site, which attempts to algorithmically curate popular posts for users, will feature only âverified accountsâ, Musk tweeted, describing the decision as âthe only realistic way to address advanced AI bot swarms taking overâ. Voting in polls on the site will also require verification âfor same reasonâ, Musk added. From 1 April, existing users with verification badges on the site, now known as âlegacy verifiedâ, will lose them unless they pay the monthly fee. A âverified accountâ will need to pay the Â£8 fee and provide a working phone number. In 2022, Musk proposed requiring users to pay a fee to vote in polls, after a public proposal that he step down as chief executive of the site came to a surprise close with a large majority in favour of him quitting. Although he had initially promised the vote would be binding, in the hours after he began flirting with the idea that a large number of âbotâ accounts had skewed the vote. As well as the Â£8 monthly service for Twitter Blue, organisations have been offered a distinctive form of verification, which gives a yellow tick, with a price tag of $1,000 a month. That allows them to bestow further verification for their employees, for another $10 a month, while linking them back to the company. Not everything is bad for the former Twitter elite, though. According to a report from the Platformer newsletter, Twitter still offers special service to a hand-picked list of 35 VIPs, including Musk himself, who are artificially promoted on the platformâs algorithmic feeds. The list includes a bizarre selection of power users from across American society, including the politicians Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Joe Biden, journalists Ben Shapiro, Matthew Yglesias and Glenn Greenwald, and the poster Dril, who once tweeted (in capitals): âIf the zoo bans me for hollering at the animals I will face god and walk backwards into hell.â But the list was not created to boost the accounts, according to the report. Instead, it was assembled to help reassure Musk that algorithmic changes were not affecting his own reach. A cross-section of the platformâs biggest accounts, it helped demonstrate which changes to the ranking system were meaningful, in the process increasing their engagement.",Guardian,28/03/2023,"Twitter to promote only paying usersâ tweets, Elon Musk announces",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/28/twitter-to-promote-only-paying-users-tweets-elon-musk-announces

Elon Musk revealed in a memo that Twitter's value has decreased by half since his acquisition. The platform has faced challenges like an advertiser boycott and concerns over moderation standards.","Twitter has revealed some of its source code has been released online and the social media platform owned by Elon Musk is taking legal action to identify the leaker. According to a court filing made on Friday, Twitter is demanding that GitHub, a code-sharing service, identifies who released on the platform parts of its source code â the underlying software on which the service operates. GitHub has taken down the leaked code but Twitter has asked a US court to order the Microsoft-owned business to âidentify the alleged infringer or infringers who posted Twitterâs source code on systems operated by GitHub without Twitterâs authorisationâ. The code was posted online by a GitHub user who used the name FreeSpeechEnthusiast, in an apparent nod to Musk, referring to himself as a âfree speech absolutist.â Musk is obsessed with the threat of Twitter being sabotaged by current and former staff, according to the tech newsletter Platformer, after a takeover that led to the immediate firing of half of Twitterâs 7,500 staff and the reinstatement of formerly suspended rightwing accounts including that of Donald Trump. Twitterâs workforce now numbers fewer than 2,000 people. In the court filing, Twitterâs assistant general counsel, Julian Moore, said the request to identify the leaker was being made under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which came into force in 1998. Leaking source code could allow security vulnerabilities, according to one expert. âLeaks of source code like this can allow security vulnerabilities to be identified and may disclose sensitive commercial information,â Steven Murdoch, a professor of security engineering at University College London, said. âHowever, Twitterâs most valuable resources are its brand, customer base, and the skills of its employees. I would be surprised if this leak has any significant long-term effect on the company.â Twitterâs cybersecurity setup was strongly criticised by a whistleblower before Musk completed his takeover. Twitterâs former head of security, Peiter âMudgeâ Zatko, who was fired in January 2022, claimed he had uncovered âextreme, egregious deficiencies by Twitter in every area of his mandateâ, including weak controls of employee access to user data and interference by foreign governments. The filing on Friday was made as Musk revealed to employees that the business he bought for $44bn (Â£36bn) in October is now worth less than half that, according to a memo seen by the New York Times. The memo said Twitter, which has debts of $13bn related to the financing of the takeover, had been four months away from running out of money. The platform, which makes most its revenue from advertising, has been hit by an advertiser boycott after Muskâs acquisition, amid concerns over issues including moderation standards and the impact of job cuts.

30,"Twitter's value has reportedly dropped to less than half of what Elon Musk paid for it six months ago, losing over $20 billion. Musk's leaked memo suggested the company is now valued at less than $20 billion, compared to the $44 billion he paid in October 2022. Advertiser departures and a devaluation of Fidelity's stake have contributed to the decline. Musk mentioned a path to a $250 billion valuation and proposed a stock grants model similar to SpaceX's.","Twitter is worth less than half of what Elon Musk paid for it six months ago having lost more than $20bn (Â£16.4bn) in value, according to calculations based on a leaked memo from the billionaire. Musk suggested in memo to the social media companyâs staff that it is now valued at less than $20bn. This compares with the $44bn he paid for it in October 2022. The companyâs steep devaluation follows Muskâs turbulent takeover. Several large advertisers have left the platform and a major source of funds for Muskâs purchase of the company, the investment firm Fidelity, has written down the value of its stake by 56%. The measure of Twitterâs worth was based on Muskâs offer of stock grants, according to Platformer and the Information, which first reported on the memo. Generally used as way to incentivise employees, stock grants are an opportunity to buy shares that cannot be sold until a set point in time, as opposed to stock options, which - depending on the conditions applied - can be more flexible. The aim is to encourage staff to reach a set valuation by a point in time so that they can sell their shares for cash. The stock grants could be âsold every six months, based on a third party valuationâ, another separate internal email to Twitter staff said. Muskâs email also said that, before a spate of high-profile, acrimonious layoffs the company had been about four months from running out of money. Twitterâs headcount has been cut from about 7,500 to about 2,000 employees, according to figures Musk put forward in December. In his latest memo, he also told staff: âI see a clear, but difficult, path to a &gt;$250B valuation,â which would imply a tenfold increase in share value. The memo suggests the model would be similar to that which Musk, who also runs Tesla, has adopted at SpaceX, another of his companies, which allows staff to sell shares back to it.

The commission, however, disagreed and referred the matter to the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal for a jurisdictional decision.","Twitter has lost a bid to have a complaint by an advocacy group for Australian Muslims thrown out after they accused the platform of failing to take action against accounts that incite hatred. The Australian Muslim Advocacy Network (Aman) lodged a complaint to the Queensland Human Rights Commission (QHRC) last June. They argued that, as a publisher, Twitter Australia and Twitter Inc are responsible for content posted by a far-right account that has been referred to in the manifesto of a white supremacist and mass murderer. Aman says the platform has repeatedly refused to delete the account or take down replies to its posts which refer to the Qurâan as âthe terrorist handbookâ and to Islam as âthe most violent and sexually perverse cultâ. The complaint to the commission contained 419 items, including 29 tweets it claims incited hatred and 390 comments and quotes on those tweets. Aman made the complaint under Queenslandâs Anti-Discrimination Act, alleging Twitter incited hatred as a publisher of third-party accounts, as well as discrimination for refusing to take action against hateful content. Twitter hit back at the complaint, arguing it should be dismissed as it was âmisconceivedâ and âlacking in substanceâ, according to a letter detailing the QHRCâs decision. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The letter, seen by Guardian Australia, argued Twitter Australia was the wrong entity for the complaint as it does not host, operate, or control the Twitter service â which is controlled by Twitter Inc. Twitter Inc argued Queenslandâs Anti-Discrimination Act does not apply to it, as the platform is âincorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in the United Statesâ. The company also refuted the idea that âany courts or tribunals in Queensland are or can be a âcourt of competent jurisdictionâ in relation to the complaintâ. In a decision by the QHRC, a commission officer said they could not agree that the complaint was âmisconceived or lacking in substanceâ. The officer also questioned Twitterâs claims that the stateâs legislation does not apply to them, before referring the matter to the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal for a decision on jurisdiction. âA foreign person is not immune from [the] application of Queensland legislation in respect of things that occur in Queensland,â the officer said. âThe service is available and operates within Queensland and as such, it is likely to be required [to] comply with Queensland legislation.â The QHRC officer wrote that the matter âremains unresolvedâ despite the parties participating in a conciliation conference on 11 October. Aman said Twitterâs approach âcontradictsâ the position put forward by Twitter Incâs chief executive, Elon Musk, at Februaryâs world government summit in Dubai. âSocial media companies should adhere to the laws of countries, and not try to put a thumb on the scale beyond the laws of countries,â Musk said at the summit. âI think that the general idea is to reflect the values of the people as opposed to imposing the values of, essentially San Francisco and Berkley, which are somewhat of a niche ideology as compared to the rest of the world.â Aman says community groups have been forced âto bring one legal action after another to assert their right to live free from discriminationâ. âThe case will deal with issues of public importance, such as the degree to which social media companies are liable for content published on their platform and whether it is discriminatory for platforms not to uphold local standards,â they said. A QHRC spokesperson said complaints lodged with the commission are âconfidentialâ and they âdo not provide any details about any complaint at any stage of proceedingsâ.

32,"Shares in banks worldwide have tumbled amid fears of a broader crisis triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). The rapid spread of market concerns has been fueled by social media chatter, accelerating the panic. SVB's failure, coupled with online banking accessibility and viral social media behavior, has amplified the psychological factors behind a bank run. Regulators and bank executives are scrambling to respond to the unique challenges posed by social media-driven financial crises.","Shares in banks all over the world have plummeted in recent days as fears that the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) could precipitate a wider crisis in the sector. The speed at which market jitters have spread across the world have forced bank executives and regulators to move with unprecedented swiftness: US authorities guaranteed all deposits in SVB â and smaller bank Signature â 48 hours after it collapsed. Just hours after Credit Suisseâs share price plunged on Wednesday, the Swiss central bank stepped in with a $54bn loan. While thereâs nothing new about a financial emergency, these crises â and their resulting responses â are unique in having been accelerated by a frenzy of social media chatter that has fuelled the panic. âIt was a bank sprint, not a bank runâ A bank run occurs when customers lose faith in an institutionâs ability to look after their money, and large numbers withdraw their deposits all at once. As more people withdraw their funds, the likelihood of the bank being able to cover the withdrawals falls, leading more customers to pile in and demand the return of their money. âIf you see a bomb disposal expert running down the street, donât ask them whatâs happened, just try to keep up,â writes Daniel Davies, the managing director of Frontline Analysts, in the Financial Times. Rumours around a bankâs solvency can build up for months or years before it leads to a run. Or it can happen in a matter of hours. The collapse of SVB was the second-largest bank failure in the history of the United States. The largest, Washington Mutual in 2008, took place over the course of eight months. SVBâs collapse played out in barely two days. Anxious Twitter posts and WhatsApp exchanges, coupled with the ease of access that online banking provides, are seen by analysts as a serious catalyst for the current crisis. Experts suggest that in the social media age, the psychological behaviour behind a bank run â mass fear from depositors of losing their savings â may be amplified and go viral quicker than bank officers and regulators can successfully respond. Michael Imerman, a professor at the Paul Merage School of Business at the University of California-Irvine, says that what happened to SVB was, âa bank sprint, not a bank run, and social media played a central role in that.â âYou should be absolutely terrified right nowâ What few SVB customers realised a week ago was how vulnerable their bank was. Like all banks, it had invested its customers deposits, with much of the money going into long-dated US government bonds. The problem was that bonds have an inverse relationship with interest rates, so when the Federal Reserve started to hike rates rapidly to combat inflation, the bonds SVB owned started to lose significant value. Many of SVBâs customers were also hurt by interest rate rises and needed to access their deposits to meet day-to-day business expenses. But with the value of their investments squeezed, the bank struggled to meet their customers demands. A decision to raise funds through a sale of shares proved to be the bankâs death knell. Venture Capital firm, Founders Fund, is reported to have told companies in its portfolio to move their money out of SVB. In the gossip-fuelled world of Silicon Valley, this news spread like wildfire. Customers withdrew $40bn â one-fifth of SVBâs deposits â in just a few hours. Mark Tluszcz, CEO of Mangrove Capital, tweeted: âIf you are not advising your companies to get the cash out, then you are not doing your job as a board member or as a shareholder.â Investor Bill Ackman tweeted that if federal regulators didnât quickly step in and guarantee all deposits, runs on other banks would start on Monday. âYou should be absolutely terrified right now,â investor Jason Calacanis tweeted, using all capital letters for emphasis. âThat is the proper reaction to a bank run and contagion.â Other high-profile entrepreneurs sounded the alarm which spread on social media, resonating loudly with the bankâs customers who tended to be tech-savvy entrepreneurs keenly tuned in to online chatter. Congressman Patrick McHenry, chairman of the US House Financial Services Committee, referred to the turmoil as, âthe first Twitter fuelled bank run.â Some messages that caused cold sweats among financial customers proved to be misleading, prompting calls to focus on facts not speculation. âThe last several days represent a unique incident fuelled by misinformation on social media and are not indicative of the health of our industry,â said Lindsey Johnson, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, in a statement. The fear spreads SVB might be the first bank run of the social media era, but it wasnât the first bank to see its fundamental business rocked by feverish Twitter speculation. Early on Thursday, Switzerlandâs Credit Suisse announced that it would take a $53.7bn loan from the Swiss central bank to shore up its finances after its share price fell by as much as 30%. The selloff occurred when the bankâs largest shareholder, Saudi National Bank (SNB), ruled out providing it with fresh funding because of restrictions limiting its holding. However, SNBâs chairman said Credit Suisse was âa very strong bankâ and was unlikely to need more cash after a major restructuring plan in autumn last year. A cap on how large its stake could be was the reason for not investing further. Credit Suisseâs problems are not new, the bankâs customers have weathered a series of scandals and stock fluctuations over the past decade which have led to an exodus of clients, pulling their cash from the bank, contributing to losses that grew to 7.3bn Swiss francs in 2022. But last October, its shares fell 12% in one day after a journalists tweeted that a âmajor international investment bankâ was on the brink. The tweet was then wrongly paraphrased by investing.com, which tweeted it out to their thousands of followers. The rumour spread like wildfire across online forums and social media accounts, but was, at least then, unfounded. Credit Suisseâs issues were well established by then and its share price had been declining for months, but experts have pointed to the tweet, and its subsequent dissemination, as highly damaging to the bank. Regulators, policymakers and bankers are all now being forced to look at the role that social media may have played in the current upheaval â and work out what they can possibly do to stay ahead of the rumours.

On the final day of hearings into the former Coalition governmentâs Centrelink income compliance program, just before closing statements, the commissioner, Catherine Holmes SC, took a few minutes to make observations about media coverage of the proceedings. âThis commission has to inquire and report, and an important part of the inquiry component is these public hearings because itâs the opportunity to explore evidence in a public forum,â Holmes said. âBut not many people have the practical ability, or the time or perhaps the will to sit through day after day of hearings. The interest of what Iâll call the traditional media to distinguish it from social media in these hearings has, with some honourable exceptions, been patchy.â Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In the five months the royal commission has been holding public hearings, victims of robodebt have described financial and emotional suffering in the face of an opaque and punitive government program that was designed for budget savings rather than social welfare. Media coverage across âtraditionalâ outlets tended âto flare when a minister is on the standâ, Holmes said. The royal commission heard from multiple former Coalition ministers, including former prime ministers Scott Morrison and Malcolm Turnbull, former human services minister Alan Tudge, former government services minister Stuart Robert and former social services minister and attorney general Christian Porter. âAs a result, Iâve come to appreciate the importance of social media in this context,â Holmes said. âIâve been struck by how committed and serious some of the people tweeting are. They provide an almost full-time running summary of evidence with occasional comment. Some of them are people whoâve long been engaged in the robodebt issue. And they both tweet and cross over into mainstream commentary. âIâm thinking of people like [law lecturer] Dr [Darren] OâDonovan, [Saturday Paper journalist] Mr [Rick] Morton and [Guardian Australia social affairs and inequality editor] Mr [Luke] Henriques-Gomes,â Holmes said. âI hasten to say I donât agree with every privacy or characterisation of the evidence that Iâve seen but I want to acknowledge that the Twitter coverage of these hearings has performed a remarkably useful and important public service in giving people access to the evidence.â The welfare advocate Tom Studans, who posts as @maximumwelfare, tweeted minute-by-minute updates of the commission on every day of inquiry hearings, while another account, @strangerous10, regularly posted video clips of the evidence.

The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, hailed this as a victory for the climate and the economy. If passed, the bill would establish a $15 billion investment fund, described as one of the largest peacetime investments in manufacturing in Australia. The support of the Greens increases the chances of the bill passing the Senate.","Good afternoon. A major bill is closer to being realised after Labor agreed to Greensâ demands not to use the proposed national reconstruction fund to finance new gas and coal projects or native logging. âCoal and gas are the biggest cause of the climate crisis, so this is a big win for the climate and a big win for jobs and the economy,â the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said. Greens support means the bill is now closer to passing the Senate later this month.

35,"Twitter experienced its sixth outage this year, causing error messages and disruption for users. Speculation arose that demands made by Elon Musk, who recently took over Twitter, had contributed to the failure. The error message pointed to a mistaken change in the Twitter API, with Musk later acknowledging the need for a complete rewrite of the code. The regularity of the outages has raised concerns about a systemic problem, exacerbated by reductions in Twitter's engineering team. Financial pressures and cost-cutting measures further compound the situation.","On Monday Twitter broke for the sixth time this year. Clicking any link on the social network resulted in an error message, while attempting to post a new image resulted in nothing but a big blank box where the picture should have been. Unlike the last four outages â three in February, and another already in March â the site wasnât completely unavailable, giving Twitter users the opportunity to engage in their favourite activity: discussing the continued destruction of Twitter live on the site. (The sixth outage this year, in January, only affected Android users.) The trending topics on the site were promptly filled with various phrases relating to the outage, as users speculated that Elon Muskâs own demands had ultimately caused the failure. The error message referred to the Twitter API, a service that allows other programmes to interact with the site. In January, the company had, with no notice, banned third-party apps from using the API, rendering them non-functional overnight. The error message suggested that Twitter had continued tinkering with the feature and accidentally banned its own apps in the process. âA small API change had massive ramifications,â Musk confirmed later that day, calling the code of the site âextremely brittle for no good reasonâ. Fixing the problems, he added, would âultimately need a complete rewriteâ. Just a single reliability engineer had been allocated to a project to create a paid version of the API, according to a report in the Platformer newsletter, and that engineer pushed a mistaken change to the live version of the site without realising the ramifications. Mistakes happen, and Twitter isnât alone in being knocked offline by a single engineer: in 2021, Facebookâs services were offline for almost six hours after the company accidentally deleted itself from the âphone bookâ of the internet. But the regularity of the outages at Twitter, which seems to be getting worse over time, has left some wondering if the occasional errors are adding up to a more systemic problem. Steven Murdoch, a professor of security engineering at University College London, said substantial reductions in Twitterâs engineering team meant fewer people to monitor systems and catch minor problems before they become bigger. âThe result is that eventually problems occur which are sufficiently serious to be noticed by large portions of Twitterâs user base,â he said. âIt has been suggested that rewriting the Twitter code could help avoid such problems but this is a high-risk strategy. It would result in splitting the already-reduced engineering team between maintaining the old code and making the new version.â Pushing for such a rewrite has already been the cause of Muskâs downfall once before. In the early 00s, after his company, X.com, had merged with the creators of PayPal, Musk as chief executive led a project to merge the back-ends of the two companies, which had been built on incompatible systems. The rewrite spiralled into âa holy warâ, according to a 2007 profile of his time at PayPal, and just six months after the merger, Musk was fired as chief executive while on honeymoon. At Twitter, a rewrite will also have to compete with other demands on the companyâs time. On Tuesday, the Financial Times reported that the EU had demanded Musk hire more moderation experts in order to comply with the blocâs new regime for regulating social media platforms, while the US Federal Trade Commission is investigating the company amid concerns that Twitterâs ability to protect users might have been affected by redundancies. Since Musk completed the $44bn (Â£37bn) takeover of Twitter in October last year, the workforce has been reduced from 7,500 employees to about 2,000. On Tuesday, Musk apologised to a Twitter worker after becoming engaged in a spat with him over whether he still worked at the company or not. The exchange included Musk referring to Haraldur Thorleifssonâs disability as an âexcuseâ for his performance at work. Musk, who later apologised to Thorleifsson over a âmisunderstandingâ that led to his tweets, said Thorleifsson was now considering staying at the company. Cost-cutting measures under which Twitter has stopped paying bills for office space, janitorial supplies and even web hosting are starting to meet pushback. The company stepped back from a bruising confrontation with Amazon Web Services as it tried to negotiate a discount on its cloud computing, according to the news site The Information, while a similar standoff with Salesforce saw its Slack communications platform disabled entirely over one weekend in February, leaving staffers unable to collaborate. Twitterâs engineering problems are taking place against a backdrop of financial pressure against the company, which took on $13bn of debt as part of Muskâs funding package for the takeover. That debt requires quarterly interest payments of about $300m. Musk made the first payment in January but analysts have warned that the business, which was loss-making for the majority of its existence before the takeover, must stage a turnaround in order to make those payments consistently. The Tesla boss said this week that Twitter had a âshotâ at being cashflow positive in the next financial quarter, referring to one of the financial metrics that can be used to indicate whether a company can meet its debt payments. But at what cost? Twitter has a âshotâ at being financially sustainable due to cuts that appear to be affecting the reliability of the site as well as alarming regulators. According to Twitterâs last set of quarterly results as a listed company, published in 2022, Twitter generated negative free cashflow (spending more cash to run the business than it takes in) of nearly $124m. Musk also reiterated his plans to introduce payments on Twitter, and said he envisions users could eventually send money to each other with one click. âI think itâs possible to become the biggest financial institution in the world,â he said. However, advertising is Twitterâs largest source of revenue, accounting for the majority of its $5.1bn turnover in 2021, and Musk admitted soon after the $44bn takeover in October last year that there had been a âmassiveâ drop in advertising revenue. In January it was reported that Twitterâs daily revenue was down 40% compared with the previous year. Farhad Divecha, the managing director of UK digital marketing agency Accuracast, said: âTrust is a big factor right now, and these outages do not instil a lot of confidence in Twitterâs ability to service our clients to the level where we or the brands we represent feel comfortable putting money in the service.â Site breakages add another complication to Muskâs drive to put Twitter on a sustainable footing.",Guardian,8/03/2023,Rise in Twitter outages since Musk takeover hints at more systemic problems,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/08/spike-in-twitter-outages-since-musk-takeover-hint-at-more-systemic-problems
36,"The ABC has accused News Corp and the Daily Mail of amplifying misogynistic social media abuse by publishing articles that showcased abusive tweets targeting News Breakfast host Lisa Millar over her outfit. The ABC criticized the outlets for giving publicity to anonymous bullies and perpetuating online abuse of women. The ABC's director of news, Justin Stevens, called the republishing of sexist abuse unacceptable, and Millar expressed her disappointment at the coverage on the eve of International Women's Day. Offensive tweets were later removed from the stories.","The ABC has accused News Corp and the Daily Mail of amplifying misogynist social media abuse by publishing articles that included âvileâ Twitter criticism of an outfit worn by News Breakfast host Lisa Millar. Millar was subjected to trolling for the skirt she wore on Mondayâs show, leading to two news stories that included screenshots and abusive tweets, first in the Daily Mail and then in news.com.au on Tuesday. The former foreign correspondent turned breakfast host abandoned Twitter in 2021 after a torrent of abuse about everything from her interview style to whether she smiles, but it has not stopped the critics. âGiving anonymous social media bullies publicity on a national platform is participating in perpetuating antisocial behaviour and the very serious issue of online abuse of women,â an ABC statement said. âEspecially on the eve of International Womenâs Day, we ask for a more responsible approach to reporting on these issues.â The ABCâs director of news, Justin Stevens, said republishing sexist abuse of a high-profile woman is unacceptable. âMedia outlets that amplify this disgusting anonymous trolling need to take a good hard look at themselves and their standards,â Stevens said. âThe relentless and vile bullying Lisa Millar is subjected to on social media, particularly Twitter, is unacceptable. She is an outstanding broadcaster and journalist and does an incredible job.â Guardian Australia understands Stevens also appealed directly to News Corpâs corporate affairs chief, Campbell Reid, to reconsider publishing stories like that. Some of the more offensive tweets have been removed from the story since the ABC complained. Millar has responded in an Instagram post that the coverage on the eve of International Womenâs Day âperpetuates abuse and proves to all of us how far we still have to goâ. âI would prefer to be thinking about the amazing contribution women around the world make, whether it be in their private or professional lives,â she said. The ABC was approached for comment by a news.com.au journalist at 6.42am, but the broadcaster said it was not going to dignify any âvile commentsâ being made about a presenterâs clothes by responding to them. âIf news.com.au was genuine in its concern about such behaviour, it wouldnât amplify it by republishing the comments it describes as âsickeningâ, accompanied by a screenshot,â the spokesperson said. The news.com.au story was positioned as critical of the trolls and headlined ââJust plain gutlessâ: Aussie Twitter users slam online trolls for sickening Lisa Millar commentsâ. The story ended with: âMillar returned to the set on Tuesday morning alongside co-host Michael Rowland wearing a green long-sleeve blouse and black slacks.â The ABC said it regularly receives queries concerning abusive comments âunder the guise of concernâ but that these stories âare republishing abuseâ.

Despite the fix, users still had difficulty accessing their home feed while notifications and direct messages worked. Elon Musk's ownership of Twitter has been marked by numerous layoffs, reduced communication, and cost-cutting measures. This outage marks the fifth this year, surpassing last year's total, raising concerns about the platform's stability.","Twitter was unavailable for users around the world for over an hour on Wednesday morning, the latest in a spate of technical difficulties suffered by the site since its takeover by Elon Musk. Beginning at about 10:20am UK time, visitors to Twitter.com were greeted with error messages. Although the total outage was rapidly fixed, the site remained in effect nonfunctional until well into the afternoon, with users unable to access their âhomeâ feed, despite notifications, profile visits and direct messages still working. Unusually, users could still post to the site throughout the outage, and the âtrending topicsâ continued to refresh, leading to trends including â#TwitterDownâ, âMy Twitterâ and âWelcome to Twitterâ. The âFor Youâ feed, which presents an algorithmic collection of the top tweets across the site, was restored before the home feed. Since taking over the business in November, new owner and chief executive Elon Musk has launched at least eight waves of punishing layoffs, reducing the headcount from 7,500 before he started to fewer than 2,000 people. Reports from inside the business have described âcriticalâ teams being laid off in their entirety, with hurriedly promoted replacements struggling to pick up where their departed colleagues left off. For the remaining staff, communication has also been hampered by other cost-cutting decisions. Twitter has stopped paying rent in locations around the world, reversing Muskâs initial push to force all staff to return to the office, while an unannounced reorganisation of its internal communication platform, Slack, saw employees cut off entirely for more than a day, until access was restored with more than 80,000 pre-existing channels archived. In November, after the second wave of layoffs â prompted by Muskâs demand that workers sign a pledge to an âextremely hardcoreâ mode of working â the chief executive reassured onlookers that Twitter would not shut down because of the lack of staff, saying âthe best people are staying, so Iâm not super worriedâ.

The job cuts account for about 10% of Twitter's workforce, with positions such as product managers and engineers being affected. Esther Crawford, the director of product management, was among those reportedly let go. Musk's cost-cutting measures come as Twitter faces financial uncertainty and seeks to generate subscription revenue. The platform's premium subscription service, Twitter Blue, has approximately 180,000 subscribers in the US.","Elon Musk has fired another 200 staff at Twitter including the executive behind the revamp of its paid-for premium service, according to a report. The latest round of job cuts equates to about 10% of Twitterâs vastly reduced workforce, which stood at 7,500 people before Musk bought the company in October. According to the New York Times, Twitter sacked at least 200 employees from its 2,000-strong workforce on Saturday. The redundancies affected jobs including product managers, data scientists and engineers who ensure the site runs efficiently, the NYT reported. Esther Crawford, the director of product management at Twitter who oversaw the introduction of charging for account verification, was reportedly among the employees affected. Muskâs hard-driving approach to management was exemplified in November by a picture of Crawford sleeping on the floor of Twitterâs offices, which she retweeted with the hashtag #SleepWhereYouWork. Crawford, tweeted on Sunday that she was âdeeply proudâ of her team, as she criticised people who had jeered or mocked her achievements, although she did not confirm her departure directly. Twitterâs premium subscription service had a troubled relaunch in November after some users took advantage of paying for a verified account by launching a slew of impersonator accounts. Nintendo, the pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly and the US politician Ted Cruz were among the firms and public figures who found themselves being impersonated by accounts with blue ticks. Twitter Blue was relaunched again in December and, according to news site the Information, has 180,000 subscribers in the US compared with a global monthly user base of more than 250 million people. Musk has identified growth in subscription revenue as a key target for Twitter, which relied on advertising for the majority of its income prior to his takeover but has suffered a plunge in ad revenue because of issues including the impersonation problem. The job losses have taken place against a backdrop of financial uncertainty at Twitter, a company that has been loss-making historically and has struggled to generate the cash flow required to pay off the significant debts it inherited after Muskâs $44bn (Â£36.7bn) takeover. The dealâs financing included $13bn worth of debt that now sits on Twitterâs balance sheet and costs more than $1bn a year to service. Twitter made the first quarterly payment on that debt in January, but analysts have warned that Musk needs to turn round the business in order to make the debt sustainable in the long term. Musk sacked half of Twitterâs workforce, about 3,750 people, within days of taking over the business and hundreds more left weeks later after the Tesla CEO demanded that staff commit to being âhardcoreâ or leave. Musk said in December that his cost-cutting drive meant Twitter was is ânot on the fast lane to bankruptcy any moreâ but he has continued to take action on costs in 2023.

","The BBC has removed a story about Will Ferrell apologising to Sunderland football fans, after being fooled by a parody Twitter account with a paid-for blue tick. Ferrell, who has been touring Britain attending football matches over the past month, recorded a video before Sunderland played his team, Queens Park Rangers, in which he mocked âthe tears of sorrowâ his opponents were going to experience. After the match â which Sunderland won 3-0 â a Twitter account named âWill Ferrellâ tweeted a screenshot of a headline about Sunderland fans hitting back, and said âHaway man, sorryâ. Readers who tapped on the account (@OfficialWilllF, with three âlâs) would see it had a blue âverifiedâ tick. But only if they tapped on the tick itself would they be told that the account âis verified because itâs subscribed to Twitter Blueâ, Twitterâs paid-for subscription. The accountâs bio reads âComedian, actor, impressionist (parody)â and has fewer than 40,000 followers. âIn a BBC News Online article, we incorrectly stated QPR fan and actor Will Ferrell apologised for mocking Sunderland fans,â the broadcaster said in a statement. âA quote was taken from a verified Twitter account, but it was not made by the actor. We have removed the article in its entirety since it was based wholly on the apology.â Twitterâs move to replace its âlegacyâ verification, which required accounts to prove they were who they said they were, with paid-for Twitter Blue, has led to a rash of impersonation incidents. On the weekend the service was launched, a number of accounts paid for the new verification tick after changing their names to major companies or advertisers. One prankster registered and verified the handle of pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly before tweeting that insulin would be free â an announcement that had an immediate impact on the companyâs stock price. Elon Musk, the siteâs owner and chief executive, was also the target of a number of impersonation incidents, until the verification programme was briefly suspended. When it was resumed, Musk said it had safeguards against impersonation, but in January the Washington Post successfully registered and verified a fake account claiming to be the US senator Ed Markey. Despite the issues at Twitter, Meta announced on Monday it would be following the companyâs lead and offering paid-for verification for users of Facebook and Instagram.

40,"The author reflects on their decision to quit Twitter due to its descent into negativity and the desire for attention. They mention Charlie Brooker's belief that Twitter is a game where users compete for followers. The toxic environment, including racism and tribalism, contributed to their departure. They acknowledge the positive aspects but ultimately prioritize their mental health and job performance. Another football writer shares similar concerns and highlights the damage caused by criticism and negativity.","A few years ago, Charlie Brooker â creator of the brilliant Black Mirror and a former Guardian columnist â hosted a show for Channel 4 that counted down the greatest video games of all time. A sucker for those sorts of things, not to mention a bit of a gamer in my youth, I tuned in with great interest. There they were: Super Mario Bros, Street Fighter II, Call of Duty â¦ on it went until it was time for Brooker to reveal the No 1. âWhat could it be?â I wondered. I was not ready for the answer, because the answer was Twitter. A baffling choice and I canât remember Brookerâs logic for why Twitter was best of the lot. But I do remember his argument for why it was definitely a game, which was that, ultimately, the aim of people who use it is to collect as many followers as possible. Nobody wins Twitter, but everyone plays it, trying their hardest to be among the most popular, influential, important people on there. Itâs something that stuck with me and turned over in my head whenever I logged into my account. What is the point of this? What am I trying to achieve? Am I, as Brooker suggested, desperately seeking attention? The answer I came to is yes, I am, so I decided to log out once and for all. Yes, thatâs right, Iâm off Twitter. Sober for a little under three months and loving it. I left during the World Cup and because of the World Cup, having decided to disengage as much as possible with a tournament whose very existence led to sick forming in my mouth. But it had been a long time coming and fundamentally for what we can at this stage call Brookerâs Law; that every tweet, to varying degrees, is a cry to be noticed. A big opinion. Look at me. A hot take. Look at me. A six-part thread. Look at me. An eight-part rant. Look at me. This job Iâve got, this award Iâve won, this photo of my cute daughter on the swings, this photo of my cute dog on Whitby beach. Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me. On it goes, as relentless as it is nauseating. I was just as bad, what with my wry quips, silly puns and pictures of beer and bridges from trips to watch Liverpool play in Europe, all with the aim of chasing those likes and retweets. I knew what I was doing and kept on doing it until, finally, I stopped. On a Thursday. In late November. Attention is a human craving, one thatâs incredibly addictive, which is why social media thrives. It can be hard to kick the habit and that is why I knew I had to go cold turkey in regards to the only platform I was on. No half measures such as deleting the app from my phone and pretending I wouldnât just log on via Google. No, the account had to be deactivated. Get out quickly and emphatically. My sense is few of my followers noticed what I did, which pretty much summed up my time on Twitter, too. But thatâs fine because my decision to quit Twitter was based on factors beyond a need for recognition. More broadly, its descent into hell under Elon Musk â or as the comedian John Oliver described him: âA man who answers the question: âWhat if Willy Wonka benefited from apartheid?ââ â and because of my increasing unease with being part of âFootball Twitterâ. Itâs been a nightmare of noise for some time, exhibiting the racism, sexism and homophobia you get on other parts of the site, while also providing its own uniquely tribal flavour, which can be stupidly childish as well as searingly nasty, seen starkly in the abuse those who lost loved ones at Hillsborough are subjected to. Then thereâs the increasingly tiresome scourge of whataboutery. Has football discourse always been this way and the difference now is we can see it laid out in front of us, 280 characters at a time? Or have things changed as a consequence of the polarised times we live in? Itâs probably a bit of both and sadly there is little sign of things becoming nicer, kinder, any time soon. You can mute and block as much as you want, but such are Twitterâs algorithms and the way things are shared, some of the sewage will always wash up on your shore. Iâve walked away from Twitter before, including 11 years ago when I received abuse from a gang of trolls so vicious it led to me getting the police involved, but this time really does feel like for keeps. Iâm not missing it in the slightest and the impact on my job has been minimal â turns out it is possible to be a sports journalist without reading and writing tweets. More importantly, the benefit to my mental health is clear. Itâs not that itâs necessarily improved â life ensures my state of mind is always a bit crap â but no more timeline-scrolling has undeniably meant it not getting notably worse. Concerns over his mental health is why fellow Liverpool-supporting football writer Henry Jackson has also given consideration to coming off Twitter. âIt has become a far nastier place,â he says. âPeople are so opinionated that they can never be wrong and it all feels so tribal, not just between rival fans, but among those of the same team. Start tweeting about Jordan Henderson or Naby KeÃ¯ta to lots of Liverpool-focused accounts, for instance, and all hell will let loose. âIt can be damaging to be on Twitter, especially when youâre sensitive and take criticism to heart like I do,â he says. âThereâs enough negativity in the world without social media adding to it.â As Jackson stresses, there are positives to Twitter, in his case being somewhere he can plug articles and âallow my personality to shine throughâ. Thatâs also the case for others and itâs where I made friends and came across important and stimulating journalism, as well as important and stimulating debates. Then there was the fun stuff, such as podcast recommendations and Josh Pugh sketches. For many, the sense of community is also important, which in relation to âFootball Twitterââ means people connecting with a sport that can otherwise feel unwelcoming to them, for various reasons. So good luck to the good folk who continue to use Twitter. I wish you well. But for now and the foreseeable future, Iâm done. No more attention-seeking and abuse. Account deactivated.

41,"Twitter is discontinuing SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA), urging users to switch to more secure methods. The move comes as SMS 2FA has been prone to abuse and sim-jacking attacks. Users are advised to use authenticator apps like Google Authenticator or password manager apps for 2FA. Another option is using a security key, a USB drive for authentication. Users should choose the method they feel most comfortable with and ensure they enter the code correctly and securely.","On the weekend, Twitter announced that from 20 March, people who havenât subscribed to Twitter Blue will have two-factor authentication via SMS disabled. Twitter has recommended people use third-party apps or a security key instead, but for the overwhelming majority (74.4%) of the 2.6% of active Twitter users who use SMS as their method of authentication, it will mean they have a month to switch or potentially lose protection. So what is two-factor authentication and what should you do to secure your social media account? What is two-factor authentication? Two-factor authentication (2fa) is a second step once you have logged into an online account with a password to prove you are who you say you are. It is an extra layer of security so if your password is compromised, it will be slightly harder for someone to access your account. For authenticator apps and SMS two-factor authentication, you are sent or provided with a number or numbers for you to enter back into the website. Most online services like social media platforms, banks and ones used in workplaces now either require or strongly recommend people use 2fa on their accounts. Why is Twitter switching away from SMS-based 2fa? Twitter claims that SMS 2fa has been âused and abused by bad actorsâ. The companyâs owner, Elon Musk, claims this abuse is costing Twitter about US$60m a year. While the company is correct that SMS-based authentication is not the best, it is not widely considered to be a money-making venture for those who misuse it. Why are other apps better than SMS for authentication? Although no method is foolproof, SMS is much easier to compromise. People can use what is called sim-jacking or sim-swapping to take over your mobile number which can then be used to access your account. This is done by convincing or forcing a telecommunications company to port your mobile number over to a new sim card. Some countries, including Australia, have introduced rules requiring telecommunications companies to properly verify who someone is before allowing them to port a mobile number to a new provider. If I want a second layer of security on my Twitter account, what other options do I have? One option is using a third-party authenticator for 2fa, rather than Twitterâs own service. Google Authenticator is the most prominent third-party app used for 2fa. However, password manager apps, including the one built into Appleâs iOS, now offer to also act as authenticators for Twitter and other sites. When you set up 2fa via the Twitter app on your mobile , it will prompt where you can authenticate. Another option is using a security key, which is a USB drive you can insert into your computer that can be used to authenticate yourself when logging into websites. While most are USB-C or USB based, some can connect wirelessly or through Appleâs lightning port. It a hardware option if you prefer not to use an authenticator app. What should I switch to? Use whatever you feel most comfortable with. If youâre already using a password manager and that app also offers 2fa, then it makes sense to keep using what you know. Whatever you are using, just make sure youâre entering in the number into the correct site and never give out the number to someone on the phone. Although the window for the code to be valid is short, if someone is trying to discover your code and take over your account, they might still be able to if they work quickly enough.",Guardian,21/02/2023,Twitter is ending free SMS two-factor authentication.

42,"Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, will introduce paid verification for users, similar to Twitter's model. The service, initially rolling out in Australia and New Zealand, will cost $11.99 per month on the web and $14.99 on iOS and Android. Verified accounts will receive a blue badge, enhanced impersonation protection, improved reach, and customer support. Meta will require government ID documents for verification and restrict the service to individuals aged 18 and above. The move follows Meta's workforce reduction and declining revenue. In a separate announcement, Twitter will limit SMS-based two-factor authentication to paid subscribers starting March 20, raising concerns about potential hacks for non-subscribers who fail to switch authentication methods.","Facebook and Instagram users will soon need to pay to be verified on the social media platforms, as Meta follows in the footsteps of rival platform Twitter. Mark Zuckerberg, Metaâs chief executive, announced in a Facebook post on Sunday that the service would first roll out in Australia and New Zealand later this week. The company said it would cost US$11.99 a month on web or US$14.99 on iOS and Android (or, in Australia, $19.99 on web or $24.99 on iOS and Android). Zuckerberg said in addition to a blue badge the service would offer âextra impersonation protectionâ, improved reach for verified users and direct access to customer support. In a blog post, Meta said it would rely on government ID documents to prove the identity of verified accounts, to avoid the embarrassment of accounts impersonating people and brands â as happened when Twitter initially rolled out its paid verification service. Accounts must also have a posting history and users must be at least 18 years old. The service would not be available to businesses at this stage, Meta said. The increased visibility of posts from verified users would âdepend on a subscriberâs existing audience size and the topic of their postsâ, the company said. Those with smaller audiences might see more of an impact. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâs free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The company said it would also offer âexclusive stickersâ on Facebook and Instagram stories and Facebook reels. Meta cut 11,000 staff in November â the equivalent of 13% of its workforce â amid falling ad revenue and economic downturn. The companyâs share price fell by more than 70% in 2022 before a rebound and in July it reported its first ever fall in revenue. Twitterâs CEO, Elon Musk, responded to the news in a tweet saying it was âinevitableâ Meta would follow Twitter. Twitter restricts SMS two-factor authentication to paid accounts Separately, Twitter announced on Friday it would provide SMS-based two-factor authentication only to users who are subscribed to the US$8-a-month ($11.65) Twitter Blue service from 20 March. The company currently provides free two-factor authentication through third-party apps and a security key, which are considered more secure than SMS-based systems. If non-subscriber accounts that use SMS authentication do not switch before the deadline, Twitter said it would disable two-factor authentication for that account. The move has sparked concerns that it could lead to widespread hacks on accounts next month if they fail to switch over. Twitterâs last transparency report prior to Muskâs takeover shows that as of December 2021, although just 2.6% of active Twitter accounts use two-factor authentication, 74.4% of those use SMS as their method of authentication. Musk has claimed Twitter was being âscammedâ US$60m a year from fake two-factor authentication messages. He separately supported a tweet claiming the scams were being run by telecommunications companies that had set up bot accounts to run the two-factor authentication process to get revenue from the text messages from Twitter.",Guardian,20/02/2023,Facebook and Instagram to get paid verification as Twitter charges for two-factor SMS authentication,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/20/facebook-instagram-paid-meta-verification-twitter-charge-2fa-two-factor-authentication-via-sms
43,"The reinstatement of the far-right group Patriotic Alternative (PA) on Twitter, supported by Elon Musk, has raised concerns about the dangers of online extremism. Far-right groups like PA use platforms like Twitter to recruit politically disillusioned young men, leading to radicalization and potential acts of violence. These groups are adept at blending in with more acceptable right-wing organizations and exploit vulnerabilities of lonely and isolated individuals. Removing the influence of these groups from Twitter is crucial to protect vulnerable individuals and promote reasoned discourse.","At the end of last year, the British far-right group Patriotic Alternative (PA) was allowed back on Twitter after a ban of nearly two years for an unknown transgression. Far-right groups immediately urged Elon Musk to âbe a heroâ and also reinstate the account of the groupâs leader, Mark Collett. Three weeks later, they rejoiced as Collettâs account was returned. The reinstatements appear to be part of Muskâs commitment to free speech. But if he knew anything at all about PA, he would realise that he has placed a target on the back of every disenfranchised and politically lost young man on Twitter, many of whom are recruited to the far right via the platform. Consider the cases of two young men who recently began lengthy prison sentences for far-right terrorism offences. Daniel Harris, 19, is a far-right extremist now serving 11 years for creating videos that inspired mass shooters in the US. Luca Benincasa, 20, who recently started a nine-year sentence, was a member of the proscribed neo-Nazi group Feuerkrieg Division. Both men should be held to account for their behaviour, but their actions did not happen in a vacuum. They did not hatch from a swastika-stamped egg at 17 years old, determined to wreak havoc on the world. Their actions, and the beliefs that drove them, are the end product of years of indoctrination by online extremists. Before becoming a journalist, I worked with young men like Harris and Benincasa and have spent a considerable part of my career since then tracking the far right online. Iâve seen first-hand how easily they fall for the rhetoric of extremist and fascist groups and can say, without hyperbole, that the longer groups such as PA are on Twitter, the more dangerous they will become. Unlike the English Defence League and others content to down some beers and scream at the dinghies in Dover, PA and their ilk are tech-savvy PR machines; they know that optics matter and theyâre familiar enough with online culture to blend in with more acceptable rightwing groups when they need to. This is apparent in their tweets, promoting community-friendly litter picks and sharing pictures of cute red squirrels. Their online recruitment began on gaming platforms, where PA has a history of coercing boys into the far right, appearing first on Discord then later on the live chat feature in Call of Duty. (Both sites are aware of far-right organising on their platforms, and have committed to action, including banning accounts.) Far-right groups recognise, as the alleged human trafficker Andrew Tate did, that young men disillusioned with the current state of politics often need a strong voice to guide them, and have set out to make themselves the strongest voice in the room. Beyond online gaming communities, fringe groups have been targeted as well. This was clear towards the end of the pandemic, when groups including PA had infiltrated anti-vax conspiracy circles so thoroughly that the latter became convinced that Drag Queen Story Hour was a front for paedophile acceptance. Ostensibly supporting their anti-vax and anti-lockdown views, a post by Collett on his blog suggested his true intentions. Complaining that âany conspiracy theory â¦ or half-baked idea, is taken with the utmost seriousness â¦ [but one of the] forbidden subjects is that of the great replacementâ, he revealed that his main goal was to push these collectives further to the right. Like the young men who get sucked in by âincelâ groups, those who are susceptible to far-right influence are often lonely, isolated and unsure of how to connect with other people. They may have difficult home lives, or have been bullied and ostracised at school. Retreating into an online world, they find others in a similar situation. Their feelings are validated, their beliefs shared and their confidence that itâs the rest of the world who are âwrongâ gets a boost. Playing on those insecurities, nationalist groups quickly begin confirming these young menâs worst beliefs; they canât get a job because the governmentâs gone âwokeâ; the girls who wonât look twice at them are evil feminists out to emasculate western men; and the immigrants theyâre intimidated by are the real Big Bad, here to steal their lives, jobs and country. Scary stuff for a teenager, but luckily the far right offers a comforting solution. Join us and be protected. Join us and be part of something. Join us and be somebody. This lasts until the combination of adolescent energy and zealotry turns tragic, and they are discarded. It is telling that none of the prominent online far-right groups have commented on the cases of Harris or Benincasa. So what can we do to protect young men from their influence? For the two who have just bartered their twenties for far-right approval, all we can do is hope they get the much-needed support that it will take to improve their lives. We owe it to those just starting out on their political journeys, however, to remove the harmful influence of PA et al from Twitter. By separating the far right from their intended prey, we enable reasoned discourse and the chance to explore the disillusionment of men such as those above, free from the influence of those with ulterior motives. A win for fascism is not a win for anyone else. Even âfree-speech absolutistsâ with billions of dollars.

44,"Data collected from Twitter's API by an Australian researcher suggests that Elon Musk's tweet reach has been artificially inflated. Following reports of algorithm tweaks to boost Musk's tweets, data showed a significant increase in impressions during that period. However, after the researcher shared the findings on Twitter, his account was briefly locked, and the tweets were removed but later reinstated. Twitter's recent technical issues and upcoming changes to API access, which will no longer be free, pose challenges for researchers studying social media activity.


","Data collected by an Australian researcher via Twitterâs API appears to support media claims that the reach of the tweets of the platformâs billionaire owner Elon Musk have been artificially inflated. On Wednesday, the tech news site Platformer reported 80 Twitter engineers had been engaged to tweak the platformâs algorithm after Musk noticed a tweet from the US president, Joe Biden, about the Super Bowl outperformed his own, despite Musk having more than three times the number of followers. The report claimed engineers deployed a new algorithm to artificially inflate Muskâs tweets by a factor of 1,000, ensuring that more than 90% of Muskâs 128.9 million followers would see them. The change reportedly also ensured users who donât personally follow Musk would see his tweets in their âfor youâ tab. Dr Timothy Graham, a senior lecturer in digital media at the Queensland University of Technology, said data he extracted from Twitter using its application program interface appeared to support much of this reporting. âIt doesnât bear out that kind of order of magnitude, but definitely something happened,â he said. â[On] the night when Elon Musk reportedly asked his engineers to do stuff â¦ lo and behold, the next morning [thereâs] this massive increase in his impressions, and then thatâs sustained ever since.â The graphs show that in the hours when the algorithm change was reported to have occurred, Muskâs impressions went up 737%, and his daily impressions have close to tripled. Shortly after Graham tweeted out the graphs charting his findings, he said his Twitter account was briefly locked and then the tweets in question were removed without explanation. The tweets were reinstated a couple of hours after they were first posted. Itâs not clear whether the removal of the tweets was related to their content or an ongoing issue with the platform, which has suffered a number of technical issues since Muskâs takeover late last year. Last week users were unable to tweet for nearly an hour, being told theyâd hit their daily limit. Graham, who typically researches bot behaviour and other trends on social media, says he was able to track Muskâs tweet data via access to Twitterâs API, which he can currently access for free. Twitter has announced it will cut off free access to this service â including for researchers. Instead it will charge a minimum US$100 a month for access. âThe Twitter API may shut down any moment â if this is the last data I ever collect itâll totally be worth it,â Graham tweeted on Thursday. Graham said many of the features he currently uses for his research will also be cut off as part of the changes â even if he pays. âIt looks like theyâre going to be severely downscaling what you can get out of it, so itâs kind of grim at the moment.â He said, depending on what the final implementation looks like, he may have to turn to other platforms or methods to track social media activity. Twitter no longer has a communications department.

45,"Elon Musk reportedly directed around 80 Twitter engineers to modify the platform's algorithm to increase the visibility of his tweets. This move came after one of his tweets received significantly fewer impressions compared to a tweet from Joe Biden. The engineers deployed a new algorithm that inflated Musk's tweet reach by a factor of 1,000, ensuring that over 90% of his followers would see them. Musk hinted at this change and Twitter's adjustment to the algorithm. His focus on tweet impressions has been a subject of ongoing reports.


","Twitter chief executive Elon Musk rallied a team of roughly 80 engineers to reconfigure the platformâs algorithm so his tweets would be more widely viewed, tech news site Platformer has reported. A disgruntled Musk called for an emergency effort after a tweet he sent during Sundayâs Super Bowl game failed to achieve as much engagement as a tweet from Joe Biden, interviews and internal documents reviewed by Platformer have revealed. The effort was sparked when a tweet from the president, who has 37m followers, generated nearly 29m impressions while a similar tweet from Musk â who has 128m followers â generated little more than 9.1m impressions. A Twitter employee and cousin of Elon Musk, James Musk, posted urgently in the company Slack at 2.30am the following Monday morning, asking all employees who can code to participate. âAny people who can make dashboards and write software please can you help solve this problem,â he wrote. âThis is high urgency.â Engineers then deployed a new algorithm that artificially inflated Muskâs tweets by a factor of 1,000, ensuring that more than 90% of Muskâs 128.9m followers see them. Many who do not follow Musk are also being served his tweets in their feed through the âFor youâ tab of the appâs home page, which curates tweets from a number of accounts, including those a user is not following. Musk seemed to publicly confirm the move, in his own way, posting a meme about forcing followers to read his tweets. He also told followers to âstay tunedâ while Twitter makes adjustments to the algorithm. The decision to devote internal resources to promoting his own tweets comes amid ongoing reports about Muskâs obsession with his own impressions on the platform. Last week, a report from Platformer also revealed Musk had fired a principal engineer at Twitter who told him views on his tweets had decreased organically, with interest in the erratic CEO waning. Users have complained since Twitter made its âFor youâ page the default feed on the platform in January that Muskâs tweets were appearing more frequently. Musk, who purchased Twitter in October 2022 for $44bn, has made a number of additional changes to the platform in the intervening months, allowing the return of previously banned accounts like that of Donald Trump, changing the process for Twitter verification, and revoking free access to the platformâs API, or application programming interface. Amid ongoing criticisms of his decisions as chief executive, Musk has promised to step down and find a replacement as soon as later this year. Current employees have described a harrowing environment at the company, which laid off nearly half its workforce in November 2022.

Elon Musk reportedly instructed Twitter staff to focus on stability during the disruption.

","Twitter users were unable to post instantly on the website for almost an hour, in the latest outage to hit the social media platform since billionaire Elon Muskâs $44bn takeover. From around 10pm GMT on Wednesday, users attempting to tweet were informed by the platform they had hit their daily limit â despite many of them reporting having not tweeted at all that day. The outage affected not just new tweets but retweets and replies. Users also reported not being able to access their direct messages. Some users discovered a workaround by scheduling tweets one minute into the future. The service eventually returned at nearly 11pm GMT, however at the time of reporting, direct messages were still missing.

47,"Former Twitter executive Yoel Roth testified before the House of Representatives, stating he faced ""homophobic and antisemitic"" harassment following Elon Musk's release of the ""Twitter Files."" Roth said the harassment forced him to sell his home. The hearing aimed to examine Twitter's handling of a New York Post story about Hunter Biden. Democrats criticized the focus on former Twitter staff, emphasizing that there was no collusion to suppress conservative speech. Republicans, fueled by Musk's tweets, are pursuing claims of anti-conservative biases.","A former Twitter executive testified on Wednesday that he was forced to leave and sell his home following a campaign of âhomophobic and antisemiticâ harassment over the companyâs handling of a New York Post story about Hunter Biden. Yoel Roth, the former head of safety at Twitter, made the comments while speaking to a committee in the newly Republican-controlled House of Representatives, at a hearing convened to scrutinize the social networkâs handling of a 2020 report on Joe Bidenâs son. Roth said the release of the so-called Twitter Files by Twitterâs new CEO, Elon Musk, led to a campaign of harassment against him and other employees. The harassment intensified when Musk and others amplified âdefamatoryâ claims that he condones pedophilia, Roth said. The Twitter Files, shared by Musk in December 2022, was a series of internal records showing how the company initially stopped the story â which the Post said was based on a copy of Hunter Bidenâs laptop hard drive from Donald Trumpâs then personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani â from being shared, citing the companyâs internal policy on âhacked materialsâ and concerns from Bidenâs campaign, among other factors. Roth said the release of the Twitter Files, which included his name along with those of other decision makers at the company, had âvery real consequencesâ for his safety. âThis lie led directly to a wave of homophobic and antisemitic attacks against me â¦ of which Twitter has removed vanishingly little. And following the Daily Mailâs decision to publish where I live. I had to leave my home and sell it.â Roth noted he was not the only one affected, saying lower-level Twitter staff around the world, including the Philippines, âhad their families threatened and experienced harm equal to or greater than what Iâve experiencedâ. âThose are the consequences for this type of online harassment and speech,â he concluded. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat representing the District of Columbia, said Rothâs testimony showed the dangers of âlegitimizing unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about the deep state, big tech and government and government censorship for political gainâ. âCommittee Republicans are holding a match to a powder keg,â she said. Her point was underscored when the extremist Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was temporarily banned from Twitter for sharing Covid-19 misinformation, used her questioning period to attack Roth, doubling down on unfounded and homophobic conspiracy theories. âIâm so glad youâve lost your jobs,â she said. âI am so glad Elon Musk bought Twitter.â Wednesdayâs hearing underscored a renewed interest from Republicans in wielding their power to pursue unproven claims that social media firms have anti-conservative biases, fanning partisan flames along the way. The lawmakers seem to have found an ally in Musk, who has given more fuel to such assertions with the Twitter Files and other tweets. Experts say Muskâs takeover of Twitter and sympathetic views towards such conspiracy theories could increase the risk for misinformation and harassment on the platform. âThis is somebody who flirts with conspiracy theories, has regularly retweeted conspiracy theories has replatformed conspiracy theorists and hate-mongers and white supremacists and all kinds of nefarious actors,â Jessica J GonzÃ¡lez, co-chief executive officer of the civil rights group Free Press, said of Musk. Other former senior Twitter staff, including Vijaya Gadde, the social networkâs former chief legal officer, former deputy general counsel James Baker and former safety leader Anika Collier Navaroli, also testified in the hearing, stating that decisions around content moderation are complex and difficult. Democratic lawmakers said during the hearing that attacks on former Twitter staff were a âdistractionâ and that the witnesses had already declared under oath there was no collusion between the government and Twitter to suppress conservative speech. âWeâre wasting our time here bullying former Twitter employees,â said Maxwell Frost, a Democratic representative from Florida. âIâve been sitting here for over two hours and Iâm not really seeing the point of this hearing.â",Guardian,8/02/2023,Ex-Twitter exec details âhomophobic and antisemiticâ abuse over handling of Hunter Biden story,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/08/twitter-congress-hearing-homophobic-antisemitic-abuse-hunter-biden-elon-musk
48,"A combative hearing took place in the newly Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where former Twitter staffers were questioned about the platform's handling of reporting on Hunter Biden. Republicans used the opportunity to raise allegations of anti-conservative bias by big tech platforms. Former employees explained Twitter's decision to temporarily restrict a New York Post story, while Democrats explored Trump's attempts to interfere with content decisions. Elon Musk's release of internal records added fuel to Republican theories. Democrats argued that private companies have the right to decide what is allowed on their platforms.","US lawmakers held a combative hearing on Wednesday with former senior staffers at Twitter over the social media platformâs handling of reporting on Joe Bidenâs son Hunter Biden. The proceedings set the stage for the agenda of a newly Republican-controlled House, underscoring its intention to home in on longstanding and unsubstantiated allegations that big tech platforms have an anti-conservative bias. The House oversight committee called for questioning recently departed Twitter employees including Vijaya Gadde, the social networkâs former chief legal officer, former deputy general counsel James Baker, former head of safety and integrity Yoel Roth and former safety leader Anika Collier Navaroli. The hearing centered on a question that has long dogged Republicans â why Twitter decided to temporarily restrict the sharing of a story about Hunter Biden in the New York Post, released in October 2020, the month before the US presidential election. But lawmakers on both sides of the aisle used the opportunity to interrogate moderation practices at Twitter and other tech firms. âThe government doesnât have any role in suppressing speech,â said the Republican committee chairman, James Comer, hammering the former employees for censoring the Post story. In that report, the Post said it received a copy of a laptop hard drive from Donald Trumpâs then-personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that Hunter Biden had dropped off 18 months earlier at a Delaware computer repair shop and never retrieved. Twitter initially blocked people from sharing links to the article for several days, citing concerns over misinformation and spreading a report containing potentially hacked materials. In opening statements on Wednesday, the former Twitter staffers described the process by which the story was blocked. While the company explicitly allowed âreporting on a hack, or sharing press coverage of hackingâ, it blocked stories that shared âpersonal and private information â like email addresses and phone numbersâ â which the Post story appeared to include. The platform amended these rules following the Biden controversy, and the then CEO, Jack Dorsey, later called the companyâs communications about the Post article ânot greatâ. Roth, the former head of safety and integrity, said on Wednesday that Twitter acknowledged that censoring the story was a mistake. âDefending free expression and maintaining the health of the platform required difficult judgment calls,â he said. âThere is no easy way to run a global communications platform that satisfies business and revenue goals, individual customer expectations, local laws and cultural norms and get it right every time.â Elon Musk, who purchased the company last year, has since shared a series of internal records, known as the Twitter Files, showing how the company initially stopped the story being shared, citing concerns from the Biden campaign, among other factors. Republican theories that Democrats are colluding with big tech to suppress conservative speech have become a hot button issue in Washington, with Congress members using various tech hearings to grill executives. But experts say claims of anti-conservative bias have been disproven by independent researchers. âWhat weâve seen time and again is that companies are de-platforming people who are spreading racism and conspiracy theories in violation of the companyâs rule,â said Jessica J GonzÃ¡lez, co-chief executive officer of the civil rights group Free Press. âThe fact that those people are disproportionately Republicans has nothing to do with it,â she added. âThis is about right or wrong, not left or right.â Muskâs decision to release information about the laptop story comes after he allowed the return of high-profile figures banned for spreading misinformation and engaging in hate speech, including the former president. The executive has shared and engaged with conspiracy theories on his personal account. Republican lawmakers seem to have found an ally in Musk, and repeatedly praised him during Wednesdayâs proceedings. The rightwing congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene used her time on the floor to personally attack the former Twitter employees and complain about her own account, which was suspended for violating the platformâs policies on coronavirus misinformation. âIâm so glad youâve lost your jobs,â she said. âI am so glad Elon Musk bought Twitter.â But Democrats on Wednesday used their time in the House to explore how the Trump administration engaged with Twitter, revealing that the former president himself tried to interfere with content decisions. In response to questioning from the new representative Maxwell Frost of Florida, the former Twitter content moderation executive Navaroli confirmed that in 2019 Trump tried to have an insulting tweet from internet personality Chrissy Teigen removed from the platform. In the tweet, which was read for the record, Teigen referred to Trump as a âpussy ass bitchâ. Twitter denied the White Houseâs request, and it remains online today. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez further sought to disprove bias against conservative speech on Twitter when she asked about an instance in 2019, when a tweet from Trump including hate speech was kept online despite violating platform policies. The former president told Democratic congresswomen to âgo backâ to their countries, a clear violation of Twitterâs policies regarding abuse against immigrants, but was not penalized, Navaroli confirmed, and the rules were changed. âSo Twitter changed their own policy after Trump violated it to accommodate his tweets?â Ocasio-Cortez said. âSo much for bias against the right wing on Twitter.â The White House has sought to discredit the Republican investigation into Hunter Biden, calling them âdivorced-from-reality political stuntsâ. Nonetheless, Republicans now hold subpoena power in the House, giving them the authority to compel testimony and conduct an aggressive investigation. In opening statements at Wednesdayâs hearing, the Democratic representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland expressed frustration that the first tech-focused panel of the session is focused on the Hunter Biden story, which he called a âfaux scandalâ. He said private companies under the first amendment are free to decide what is allowed on their platforms. âSilly does not even begin to capture this obsession,â he said of the laptop story. âWhatâs more, Twitterâs editorial decision has been analyzed and debated ad nauseam. Some people think it was the right decision. Some people think it was the wrong decision. But the key point here is that it was Twitterâs decision.â The Associated Press contributed reporting",Guardian,8/02/2023,Republicans grill ex-Twitter executives over handling of Hunter Biden story,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/08/ex-twitter-execs-to-testify-in-congress-on-handling-of-hunter-biden-laptop-reporting
49,"Americans are skeptical of House Republicans' ability to responsibly serve as the loyal opposition to President Biden and the Democratic-controlled Senate. Polls show concerns about Republicans focusing too much on investigations and neglecting important issues. The House oversight committee's inquiry into Twitter's handling of the Hunter Biden laptop story is seen as potentially lacking grounding in reality. The committee's Republican members, including Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert, raise doubts about the seriousness of their approach. While Congress's oversight role is crucial, doubts remain about the committee's ability to fulfill it effectively.","You canât get Americans to agree on much these days â not on gas stoves, not on Chinese spy balloons, not on the books allowed in school libraries. But one thing they apparently can bond over is whether the Republicans in the House of Representatives are likely to spend the next two years responsibly serving as the loyal opposition to President Biden and the Democrats who control the Senate. Checks, balances and all that good stuff. The consensus: fat chance. Most Americans, in an NBC poll, think Republicans will spend too much time on investigations; a CNN poll showed three out of four respondents agreeing that House Republicans havenât been paying enough attention to things that matter; a Pew Research poll finds two-thirds of Americans are concerned that they will focus too much on investigating the Biden administration. In other words, the public has seen enough grandstanding to know exactly whatâs coming. âThe GOPâs investigations are going to be drawn from a grab bag of rightwing grievances,â as Hayes Brown, an MSNBC editor, recently predicted. Things kick off in earnest on Wednesday morning with the House oversight committee taking up how Twitter handled a controversial New York Post story about Hunter Bidenâs laptop, back in the fall of 2020. Will this committee stay grounded in reality as members explore legitimate questions? Iâm not hopeful, especially after hearing committee chairman James Comer, Republican of Kentucky, speculating on Fox News a few days ago about the Chinese spy balloon. Comer suggested that the balloon might be loaded with bioweapons, and then went full Trump: âDid that balloon take off from Wuhan?â Comer is the same guy who suggested back in December, again preaching to the Fox News faithful, that the Brittney Griner prisoner swap may had some tie to Hunter Biden. (Well, yes, of course, because in the Republican conspiracy world, everything must have that same diabolical connection.) Then thereâs the oversight committeeâs Republican membership, which includes Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Jim Jordan of Ohio and Lauren Boebert of Colorado. Not exactly a Mount Rushmore of governmental statesmanship. Get out your tin-foil hats and, while youâre at it, your earplugs. Itâs too bad, because Congressâs oversight role is a crucial one. Whatâs more, the way Twitter handled the New York Post story really was dubious, as Jack Dorsey, then the CEO, has acknowledged. The Murdoch-owned paper reported in the fall of 2020 that it had received a copy of a hard drive of a laptop that Hunter Biden had left many months before at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved, and that it included emails that showed attempted influence peddling by then vice-president Joe Bidenâs wayward son. For several days, Twitter blocked users from sharing links to the story. To be sure, skepticism and caution were in order. Was there reason to wonder whether such a laptop even belonged to Hunter Biden? Was there reason on Twitterâs part to fear that the whole thing was part of a Russian disinformation campaign and thus to be wary of spreading it weeks before a presidential election? Again, legitimate questions. âWe want to make sure that our national security is not compromisedâ is Comerâs explanation for bringing the former Twitter executives in for a grilling. (They are the former chief legal officer, Vijaya Gadde, former deputy general counsel James Baker, and former global head of trust and safety Yoel Roth.) Dorsey himself later called his companyâs decision to block the story without communicating the reasons âunacceptableâ. Major news organizations, meanwhile â considering the dubious source and unable to verify the facts in real time â held the New York Postâs article at armâs length, while not entirely ignoring it. One reason for caution: as the Washington Post wrote in an October 2020 analysis, the article repeated the debunked claim, spread by then president Trump, that Joe Biden, vice-president at the time of the alleged influence peddling, had pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor at his sonâs behest. But the mediaâs hesitancy to play up the story brought howls of partisan censorship from the right â especially because the presidential election was right around the corner. Speaking to the National Press Club recently, committee chairman Comer talked a good game about how he wants to lead his committee with transparency and bipartisanship, hewing closely to the mission of rooting out government fraud and mismanagement. He unveiled a long list of targets to investigate, from prescription drug pricing to the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, and of course, the inappropriate involvements of family members, which never seemed to trouble Republicans about the Trump clan. Comer claimed the high ground: âI want [it] to be a substantive committee.â I would love to believe that. But since whatâs past is prologue, I will not be holding my breath.

50,"Twitter is putting its API behind a paywall, impacting various tools and services that rely on it. The move will also hinder academic research and limit transparency. Elon Musk's decision faced criticism, prompting him to announce a ""light, write-only API"" for bots providing ""good content."" However, this creates a contradiction, as it perpetuates the lack of transparency and editorializing that Musk claimed to address when he bought Twitter. The situation highlights the risks of semi-public platforms controlled by individuals and the impact of limiting access to APIs.


","APIs may not seem like the sexiest thing to write about in a tech newsletter, but bear with me. Because APIs â or application programming interfaces â are important. Theyâre the synapses of our digital world: without them, our current ways of living wouldnât work. For example, when you visit a website that requires you to log in, and you choose to connect with a Google or Facebook account, youâre utilising an API. That click of a button that links your existing account on one platform with a new account on another is enabled by an API. They spring into action whenever one type of work interacts with another, working to bridge that gap. APIs are the overlooked and under-praised army that keeps the internet as we know it going. From Thursday, many of those features will disappear from Twitter as its API goes behind a paywall. The company announced last week that it was removing free access to its API. âThe latest set of changes to Twitter will likely spell the end of some of your favourite accounts, tools and features, as the platformâs owner, Elon Musk, continues to look for ways to increase revenue,â the Guardian reported. Those tools include services like Thread Reader, which unrolls Twitter threads into easily digestible formats, and @EarthquakeBot, which tracks weather events and natural disasters like earthquakes, as well as tools that big brands use for their customer services. The importance of APIs âAPIs are an area fraught with competing tensions,â says Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert and professor at the University of Surrey. âProbably the most sensational failure was when Facebook allowed the survey ultimately used by Cambridge Analytica to harvest sensitive data about users and their friends.â On Twitter, API access was more âbenignâ, Woodward says â limited mainly to posting via third-party apps that allow an element of automation. Perhaps more concerning is that the change in API access spells the end of academic research using Twitter. For instance, one recent academic paper that looks at all the activity on a single day on Twitter would not be possible now without paying out for access. Itâs also a wake-up call, says researcher Philipp Lorenz-Spreen, for the public to show that their data can be monetised in ways they have no control over. âThe research community in my field has always been dependent on access to the data of the very platforms they aim to study, which is an intolerable situation for independent research and now it is even more pronounced,â he says. Woodward puts it this way: âAPIs are quite important to those doing research on Twitter â¦ if he cuts this access off then some of the transparency provided by third-party researchers is likely to disappear.â The move will also affect the apps and services that use Twitter. âPeople find useful tools or services that are built on top of it, academics use it for data, companies that use it to connect with customers,â says Kate Bevan, a long-tenured tech writer who believes Muskâs API change is significant â and bad â news. Bevan is also the human behind @DaphneFlap, a Twitter bot that relies on API access for its existence, posting a photograph of the cat flap through which a cat named Daphne leaps every time a movement is sensed. âWe take APIs for granted.â Muskâs prevarications The API shift has been almost universally panned â which may explain why Elon Musk has decided to backtrack, sort of. On 5 February, he tweeted that âTwitter will enable a light, write-only API for bots providing good content that is free.â What exactly constitutes âgood contentâ isnât known. Presumably, it doesnât include @ElonJet, an account that used automated API interactions between publicly available flight-tracking data and Twitter to post the flight times and locations of Muskâs private jet â an action that the entrepreneur called âreal-time assassination co-ordinatesâ. (@ElonJet was banned in December 2022.) âI canât help but conclude that this move has been brought about because some of the fun bots have irritated people in high places,â says Woodward. âGood contentâ as per Musk might be more like @PepitoTheCat, a Twitter account that also takes a photograph every time a cat named PÃ©pito goes through its ownersâ cat flap: after all, Muskâs volte face happened in response to pleas from that accountâs owner that Muskâs policy change would âkillâ his profile. But the change, apart from being alarming, also highlights a contradiction in Muskâs goals for Twitter. He has heavily touted the Twitter Files during his time in charge of the company â a cache of internal documents, selectively given to journalists with whom he has existing relationships, which contain information he alleges proves that the platform prior to his ownership engaged in opaque decision-making around key policies. Yet by saying that heâll exempt people creating âgood contentâ from API limitations and charges, heâs perpetuating the same problem. It tackles one problem he says he sought to buy Twitter to solve â its plethora of bots, which he felt was diminishing the value of real, human interactions on the site. But it could exacerbate another problem which he said was significant enough for him to buy the platform for $44bn in the first place. Musk is introducing a lack of transparency and editorialising about what had been a simple proposition: anyone who wanted access to Twitterâs API could get it free of charge. Now, it depends on whether they produce content that appeals to his whims. Itâs yet another example of the perils of semi-public platforms being controlled by individuals. And an example of the impact that removing or revoking access to a relatively unrecognised backbone of the internet can have on everyday users.

51,"Twitter, under the ownership of Elon Musk, is introducing a paid version of its API, which will result in the loss of access for many smaller developers. This change threatens popular tools and accounts such as thread readers, automated accounts posting photos, auto-delete services, weather/environment/health trackers, and brand customer service accounts. The move is part of Twitter's effort to increase revenue, but the specific pricing details and potential impact on researchers are still unknown.","The latest set of changes to Twitter will likely spell the end of some of your favourite accounts, tools and features, as the platformâs owner, Elon Musk, continues to look for ways to increase revenue. In a post on Thursday morning, Twitterâs developer account announced free access to its application program interface (API) would be cut off and replaced with a paid version from 9 February. The API provides access to Twitter data, which can be used to create third-party apps, automated bots, customer service tools for brands, and enables researchers to report on trends or patterns on the site. While many larger companies already pay for access, it is unlikely some of the smaller developers of popular tools and accounts will be able or willing to pay. Hereâs a roundup of some popular tools and accounts that could disappear once the pay-for-access API comes into effect. Thread readers When someone posts a long thread of tweets on a topic, often someone will @ the thread reader app, which will generate the content of those tweets in a more readable format. Possum photos every hour Many automated accounts are made for fun, such as those that tweet out photographs or artwork at regular intervals. Regretfully, the Possum Every Hour account has already announced it will cease operating once the changes are brought in, but it says its work will continue on Twitterâs rival network Mastodon. Auto-delete services Twitter lacks a function to allow you to delete your tweets en masse or automatically, so third-party apps using Twitterâs API have filled that gap. Many of them charge, which suggests they might already pay Twitter for API access, but the changes could spell doom for others. Weather, environment and health trackers Earthquake bots and other accounts set up to post automatic updates on the weather, environment or health issues such as Covid can be extremely useful. They generally work by scraping data from other sites and automatically tweeting it using the Twitter API. Often theyâre run on a volunteer basis, and not-for-profit, so they could also be in trouble following the changes. Brand customer service accounts If youâre a social media manager at a big company, you might use Hootsuite or a similar platform to keep tabs on the companyâs social accounts and track customer complaints. That too relies on Twitterâs API. The first hint Twitter would clamp down on use of the API was in mid-January when Twitter suddenly shut off access for Tweetbot, a third-party Twitter app optimised for Apple products. The move was not initially explained, but the company later said it was enforcing a long-held policy. Twitterâs move to charge for API access is the latest in a string of changes Elon Musk has made since he took over the company in an effort to make it profitable. Twitter has not said what it will charge for basic API access, nor has it indicated whether the charge will apply to all users of the API, including researchers. Twitter no longer has a communications department to approach for comment, but questions were sent to the email address previously used by the organisation to field press enquiries.",Guardian,3/02/2023,Some popular accounts likely to disappear from Twitter as Elon Musk ends free access to API,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/03/some-popular-accounts-likely-to-disappear-from-twitter-as-elon-musk-ends-free-access-to-api
52,"Twitter co-founder Biz Stone expressed concerns about Elon Musk's ownership of the platform, stating that improvements in morale and content policies have been reversed. Musk has faced criticism for banning journalists temporarily and reinstating previously banned accounts. Stone highlighted the importance of accepting diverse viewpoints on social media. Musk's firing of half of Twitter's workforce and his handling of content moderation decisions have raised further concerns. Stone believes that while Twitter's future is uncertain, the concept of Twitter will endure, citing the success of alternative platforms like Mastodon.


","Elon Musk âdoesnât seem likeâ the right person to own Twitter, the social media platformâs co-founder has said, adding that improvements to morale and content policies at the business have been reversed under its new proprietor. In an interview with the Guardian, Biz Stone said positive changes he had helped oversee in recent years had been unwound by the Tesla chief executive. Stone said running social media companies is ânot really a win-win situation â¦ itâs always toughâ, because â50% of the people are gonna be happy, 50% of people are gonna be upset with youâ. âYou have to be OK with stuff that you just donât like or donât agree with being on there,â said Stone, adding: âOtherwise, you should just go buy a magazine or a newspaper or something where itâs OK to have a specific leaning.â Asked if Musk was the right owner for Twitter, Stone said: âIt doesnât seem like it right now, but I could be wrong.â Musk has come under fire for temporarily banning journalists from the platform and reinstating previously banned accounts such as those belonging to the former US president Donald Trump and the self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate. Stone, who co-founded Twitter in 2006 with Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass and Evan Williams, returned to the business in 2017 at the behest of thenchief executive Dorsey to âguide the company culture, that energy, that feelingâ. Stone said improvements during his four-year stint, particularly in morale and overseeing content, have been lost under Musk. âWe made a lot of improvements in those areas. And thatâs all gone now.â Musk has rowed back on a pledge to establish a âcontent moderation councilâ that would have overseen big content decisions and account reinstatements, instead relying on more arbitrary methods such as user polls hosted on his own Twitter account. He also fired approximately half of Twitterâs workforce within days of buying the business for $44bn (Â£35bn) last year. Stone added that employees should not have been named as part of the release of the so-called Twitter files, a series of internal documents detailing decisions such as the suspension of Donald Trump. âWhen that happens, people get a lot of harassment,â said Stone. âItâs really bad.â Twitterâs former head of trust and safety, Yoel Roth, was reportedly forced to leave his home when Musk posted tweets misrepresenting Rothâs 2016 academic thesis, âGay Dataâ. Stone said the concept of Twitter would survive, regardless of the companyâs current financial struggles. âI donât know that Twitter as a company is going to succeed for ever but the idea of Twitter I think will be around,â said Stone, pointing to the success of alternative platforms such as Mastodon. âIt would only matter that Twitter the idea continued. And thatâs happened. That seems to be happening already. Mastodon seems to be winning the open-source, decentralised version of Twitter. People seem to be going there.â He added: âI donât know the future. I donât know whatâs gonna happen and maybe things will be great in a year and [it] had to go through this trial by fire. But, right now it does not look good, I would say.â Stone spoke to the Guardian as he confirmed he is joining the board of Chroma, a Swedish startup in which he is also an investor. Chroma creates an audio-visual experience for mobile phone users, describing itself as âa world of sound experiences in a pocketâ where users can change what they see and hear. Describing Chromaâs work as âsoundplayâ, Stone added: âItâs a new way to interact with sound and to play with sound.â Last year Chroma collaborated with Venezuelan musician Arca to create Lux Aeterna, an app that creates an âever-evolving, boundless audio-visual worldâ. Stone said his investment philosophy is simple â âdo I like this personâ and âdo I think they can pull off this thing I would use myself?â He adds: âIf those two answers are yes, Iâm usually in.â Referring to Chromaâs CEO and founder, Andreas PihlstrÃ¶m, he said: âI like working with Andreas. He is a really talented designer.â Stoneâs co-investors in Chroma include Evan Sharp, the co-founder of digital pinboard platform Pinterest, and Ben Silbermann, the co-founder and CEO of Pinterest, where PihlstrÃ¶m worked as a creative director. Stone, who has also invested in the messaging service Slack and Pinterest, added that he never thought of Twitter as being successful when he co-founded it in San Francisco. âI tell young people â if youâre doing something to try to get rich, itâs probably not going to work. You should do something that youâre just really enjoying working on and then you actually have a greater chance of becoming wealthy.â",Guardian,27/01/2023,"Elon Musk âdoesnât seem likeâ right person to own Twitter, says co-founder",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/27/elon-musk-doesnt-seem-like-right-person-to-own-twitter-says-co-founder
53,"The Indian government has used emergency laws to ban links to a BBC documentary on social media platforms, including Twitter and YouTube. The documentary examines the role of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2002 Gujarat riots. The action highlights the tension between Elon Musk's pledge to uphold free speech on Twitter and the authoritarian laws governing India's online space. The Modi government has increasingly used censorship powers granted by the 2021 information technology rules to remove content critical of the administration. This move has drawn criticism from human rights groups and digital activists.","The response by the Indian government was quick and draconian. Days after a BBC documentary examining the role that Narendra Modi, now prime minister, had played in 2002 communal riots in Gujarat was released, the information ministry announced that all links to the footage were to be banned on social media. Emergency laws brought in by the Modi government just two years ago were used to enforce the ban. Both Twitter and YouTube quickly complied with the governmentâs censorship requests. Posts on about 50 Twitter accounts were removed, with activists, politicians and even Hollywood actors among those affected, as well as an unspecified number of YouTube channels. Widely shared clips of the documentary, which alleged that Modi, in his role as chief minister of Gujarat at the time, had enabled and then did nothing to stop the violence in which almost 1,000 Muslims were killed, quickly disappeared from Indian social media. It is not the first time the Modi government has used the 2021 information technology rules to censor online content critical of the administration. However, the action taken over the BBC documentary is among the most high-profile use of the legislation and sheds light on the fragile and fractious place that social media such as Twitter now occupy in India and directly pits the vow of the platformâs new billionaire owner, Elon Musk, to be a âfree speech absolutistâ against increasingly authoritarian laws governing the countryâs online sphere. Widely criticised by human rights groups and digital activists, the 2021 IT rules give the government power to remove any content it deems to threaten âthe unity, integrity, defence, security or sovereignty of Indiaâ. Even before the passing of the legislation, legal demands made by the Modi government to remove content from Twitter increased by 48,000% between 2014 and 2020, according to analysis of the companyâs transparency reports. The two-part BBC series documenting the rise of Modi has proved highly controversial in India, despite it only being released in the UK, prompting allegations from the Indian foreign ministry that it was âbiased propagandaâ that showed a âblatant colonial mindsetâ. Kanchan Gupta, a spokesperson for the information ministry, called the documentary âhostile propaganda and anti-India garbageâ and students who arranged a screening at a university in Kerala this week were accused of being âtreasonousâ. At Delhiâs prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University, students who tried the same were hit with an electricity and internet blackout, and had stones thrown at them by others from rightwing groups. The BBC has said its documentary was ârigorously researched according to highest editorial standardsâ. Many have cited their compliance with the online censorship of the documentary as an example of how Twitter and YouTube are helping to further erode freedom of speech in India, in order to appease the Modi government and not compromise access to the vast and increasingly online Indian population. There are over 40 million Twitter users in India, making it their third largest market after Japan and the US. âThis use of an emergency law as a censorship mechanism is a very worrying development but itâs far from the first time this has happened,â said Prateek Waghre, the policy director at the advocacy group the Internet Freedom Foundation in India. According to a statement to parliament in July, action was taken against 94 YouTube channels, 19 social media accounts and 747 URLs on the governmentâs request since the IT rules were passed. Before Muskâs takeover, Twitter had pushed back â though somewhat inconsistently â against the Modi governmentâs increasingly heavy-handed approach towards social media. Twitter had restored some of the accounts the administration had demanded the removal of and in July last year filed a lawsuit in Indian courts alleging New Delhi had abused its power by ordering the company to arbitrarily and disproportionately take down accounts belonging to government critics. Twitter still reports all the posts and accounts it removes at the request of the Indian government to the online database Lumen. YouTube, however, does not. Yet for all his protestations to be a crusader for free speech, there are indicators that Muskâs Twitter might be far less bullish in standing up to the Modi government. When Musk was trying to back out of the deal to buy the platform, he made it clear in the court filings that he was unhappy with the lawsuit against the Indian government, saying he believed moderation should âhew close to the laws of countries in which Twitter operatesâ. Among the Indian accounts that have been reinstated since Musk took over is that of Kangana Ranaut, a fiercely pro-Modi actor who has espoused anti-Muslim sentiments and was suspended in 2021 for posts that were seen as a call to violence against minorities. On taking over, he has not mentioned the lawsuit once but did fire almost all 200 of Twitterâs employees in India. Separately, Muskâs car company, Tesla, is lobbying Indiaâs government to reduce import taxes on electric vehicles so it can have access to the lucrative Indian market. Waghre said Muskâs position on championing free speech on Twitter, already wildly inconsistent, was likely to be âseverely tested in Indiaâ, as the furore around the BBC documentary had proven. âWeâre talking about pressures on freedom of speech in the worldâs largest democracy,â Waghre said. âMuskâs pledge has rung hollow everywhere, but in India the impact will certainly be larger.â",Guardian,25/01/2023,Indian ban on BBC Modi film puts Muskâs Twitter âfree speechâ vow to the test,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/25/india-ban-on-bbc-modi-film-elon-musk-twitter-free-speech-emergency-laws
54,"In this article, Margaret Sullivan reflects on her past interactions with Elon Musk and discusses the possibility of becoming the chief executive of Twitter. She outlines three steps she would take to improve the platform: addressing trust and safety issues, developing a new vision for Twitter's future, and hiring public editors to improve user experience and accountability. However, there are doubts about whether Twitter can be saved and if Musk would allow a new CEO to effectively lead the company.","Elon Musk and I arenât exactly old friends, but we do go back quite a few years â to early 2013 when I was the public editor (a kind of ombudswoman) at the New York Times. The Tesla head honcho was harshly accusing the paper of sabotage after its review of some new ultra-fast charging stations. The Times review featured a devastating photograph of the cherry-red Model S on a flatbed truck after it reportedly ran out of juice on the last leg of the road trip. My investigation determined that the Times did nothing unethical, though I found some of the reviewerâs methods less than ideal. I donât think either Musk or the Times was particularly thrilled with my findings. Now, a decade later, Musk and I could be ready for a new adventure â an even more contentious one. The tech-news website CNET recently suggested me as a potential chief executive for Twitter, the global social media platform which Musk has been busy running into the ground after buying it for a stunning $44bn last fall. The company has lost about half of its top advertisers since Musk took over, and stands to lose 30 million users over the next two years, according to various estimates. Under fire in late December, Musk tweeted that he would resign as CEO âas soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the jobâ. While it may be exceedingly unlikely that I, or someone like me, would ever get the nod over any of the tech bros commonly considered for such jobs, I nonetheless enjoyed thinking about what Iâd do if it came my way. And Iâve talked with people who are much more knowledgable, picking their brains on what needs to happen to save the site that has become such an important source of information and connection for millions worldwide. So, if I ran Twitter, hereâs what Iâd do on day one (and beyond): First, start putting out the multiple dumpster fires blazing in Twitter HQ. Advertisers and users alike have been fleeing in droves for good reason. The platform is a chaotic mess; increasingly a haven for hateful and dangerous content, and day by day less satisfying and more frustrating to use. So the first step needs to be a strong public message that reform is imminent: that trust and safety are a top priority, and that some of the worst changes would be immediately reviewed and likely reversed. âBring back a sense of normalcy and process,â Casey Newton, the technology journalist who founded the excellent tech newsletter Platformer, told me in an interview. These canât be empty words, of course. So a new leader must figure out how to turn good intentions into reality. That means finding the right people to carry out content moderation and make solid operational and strategic decisions. Although Twitter has lost many of its best employees in recent months â either because theyâve fled or been fired â there undoubtedly still is internal talent and knowledge. And who knows, it might even be possible to persuade some of the best of the former staffers to come back. One thing I found out in the 13 years that I led the newsroom at my hometown paper, the Buffalo News, is you canât accomplish anything on your own. You need strong, smart, knowledgable, trustworthy people by your side who arenât afraid to tell you when youâre wrong. And you need to take heed. Second, figure out a new vision for Twitterâs future. The platform is big, influential and well known, but it desperately needs to grow and develop new ways to create revenue; that could involve forays into e-commerce or paid premium subscriptions or monetizing new tools for the creators who make Twitter worthwhile. Mike Masnick, founder of the website Techdirt, told me that it would be helpful to re-enable outsiders â known as third-party developers â to come up with ways to make Twitter more useful. (Think Tweetdeck.) They would need to be given at least partial access to Twitterâs internal information, something thatâs fraught with privacy issues and other potential problems, but he thinks itâs not impossible. He mentions as one example the startup Block Party, founded by entrepreneur Tracy Chou, intended to protect against online harassment and abuse. As Masnick put it, âYou donât have to take on all the work yourself.â Third, hire a public editor or, more likely, a team of public editors. Twitterâs users are frustrated by the way the platform works â or doesnât work â now. It would help to have a place to transmit their complaints and have them taken seriously. An ombudsperson can listen to what users are saying, take those complaints to the leadership, and get some answers that could be communicated publicly. At least, as Masnick noted, it would be a powerful gesture in the direction of accountability. The public editor role â I can attest from my New York Times experience â functions as a steam valve and, as such, can prevent explosions. Of course, thereâs a real question about whether Twitter â in just a few months â has self-destructed so thoroughly that itâs no longer worth saving. And thereâs another real question about whether Musk, despite his words, would really be willing to step aside enough to let a new CEO do her job. For most of my career, Iâve worked successfully at media companies owned by billionaires, some of the richest people on the planet. First, Warren Buffett at the Buffalo News, my hometown paper where I started as a summer intern and became the first woman top editor; and more recently, Jeff Bezos at the Washington Post, where I was the paperâs media columnist for six years, mostly during the legendary Marty Baronâs stint as executive editor. Both Buffett and Bezos made it easier for those running their media operations â they trusted their appointed people and didnât interfere editorially. So, one key to running Twitter is the tricky matter of âmanaging upâ. Anyone whoâs ever worked in a corporation or big agency, especially as a manager, knows that you have to handle the boss. You have to keep them informed, hold off their worst instincts, tactfully set boundaries and, most of all, somehow convince them that every move you make is really their brilliant idea â or at least a fulfillment of their underlying vision. And thereâs the rub. Twitterâs problems are solvable. But the volatile and narcissistic Musk may be the boss that canât be managed.

55,"Twitter is facing lawsuits from landlords in San Francisco and London for allegedly failing to pay rent on its offices. The Crown Estate in London and the owner of Twitter's San Francisco headquarters have filed claims against the company. This comes after reports of unpaid rent on other Twitter offices, including one in San Francisco and another in Singapore. The legal actions follow Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter, which has been marred by job cuts, a relaunch controversy, and a drop in revenue.


","Twitter is being sued by landlords in San Francisco and London after failing to pay rent on its offices, as new owner Elon Musk takes on extreme cost-cutting strategies that reportedly include simply not paying the bills. The crown estate in London, which manages property belonging to King Charles III, filed a claim against Twitter in the high court in the UK capital last week. The alleged rental arrears relate to office space near Piccadilly Circus in central London, according to the BBC. The owner of Twitterâs San Francisco headquarters has also sued Twitter after it failed to make its latest monthly rent payment for January, amounting to $3.4m, according to documents filed on Friday with the superior court of California. This comes after a report earlier this month stated that Twitter owed $136,260 in overdue rent on a separate office in San Francisco and was facing a lawsuit. Also in January, workers at a Twitter office in Singapore were evicted due to unpaid rent on the building. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The actions came only a few months after Twitter was taken over by Elon Musk, the co-owner of Tesla and SpaceX, in October last year. Musk paid $44bn (Â£36bn) for the platform and quickly initiated sweeping job cuts to the firmâs 7,000-strong workforce â cutting it by 50%. Muskâs takeover has not been without issues, including a chaotic relaunch of the blue tick scheme for verified users that led to a number of impersonator accounts and advertisers withdrawing from the platform over concerns about a rise in hate speech. The social media company was reportedly hit by a 40% drop in revenue after more than 500 clients paused their spending, with high-profile brands such as Audi and Pfizer halting advertising. The BBC reported that the crown estate took legal action after previously contacting the social media company about the alleged rental arrears at its office space. John Wallace, a solicitor and director at the London-based law firm Ridgemont, said the hearing between the crown estate and Twitter was likely to take place in the next six months and warned that the UKâs struggling economy could lead to an increase in rent arrears claims. He said: âThe receding of the UKâs economy will inevitably lead to commercial landlords having to take action against non-paying tenants. âI would expect to see a sharp rise in commercial rent arrears claims in second and third quarters of 2023, given the Office for Budget Responsibilityâs prediction that a recession will last until at least autumn 2023.â The estate is one of the largest landowners in the UK, and although the portfolio belongs to the monarch, it is not private property. The revenue from the estate goes to the Treasury for public spending and in return the monarch receives the sovereign grant. Muskâs property woes are just the latest legal headache for the billionaire, who has been testifying in recent days in a separate class-action lawsuit from Tesla investors alleging his 2017 tweet misled them about funding to take the electric carmaker private.

56,"Chanel's latest haute couture show, led by designer Virginie Viard, took inspiration from the animals of Coco Chanel's Paris apartment. The collection featured demure glitter tweed suits and abstract plywood sculptures by artist Xavier Veilhan. Chanel will be in the spotlight with a major exhibition honoring Karl Lagerfeld at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a retrospective of Coco Chanel at the V&A. Chanel's relationship with Hollywood and its support of actors on the red carpet were also highlighted.","It was Coco herself who said fashion reflects the world we live in. But while much of fashion week holds up a mirror to the current era of roiling controversy and outrage â at Schiaparelli, a foam lionâs head worn by Kylie Jenner provoked social media fury from distressed animal lovers, until the president of Peta rode unexpectedly to coutureâs rescue by saying the look âcelebrates lionâs beautyâ â Chanel is the quiet eye of the storm. Virginie Viard, who replaced the great showman Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel four years ago, has introduced an understated mood here. The animals of Cocoâs elegant Paris apartment â where marble lions stood guard alongside pairs of carved wooden deer, and a lucky gold frog took pride of place on a coffee table â were the theme for her latest haute couture show. In contrast to Schiaparelliâs Instagram-bait of Kardashians and faux-taxidermy, the Trojan camels, stags and birds at Chanel were abstract plywood sculptures by artist Xavier Veilhan, and the models who emerged from them wore demure glitter tweed suits. Drama came with a light touch, in circus-master top hats and bow ties worn as chokers. Nonetheless, Chanel will have the lionâs share of the spotlight this year. A major exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum in New York honouring the career of Lagerfeld, who spent four decades at Chanel, will be followed by a major retrospective of Coco herself at the V&amp;A in London later this year. Backstage before the show, Chanelâs president of fashion, Bruno Pavlovsky, said he had âseen the layout of the Met exhibition â it is fantastic. I worked with Karl for many years, and he was forever talking about the latest Met show. He really loved the museum.â Pavlovsky was also waiting to discover which of Chanelâs red carpet ambassadors would receive Oscar nominations. Last year was a successful award season for Chanel, who dressed best actress nominees Kristen Stewart and PenÃ©lope Cruz. âWe have fantastic actors who can help talk about our brand, so anytime when we can help them to be at their best is very important for us,â Pavlovsky said. âWe try to position ourselves as a supportive partner â it is a case of whatever they want, when they want it.â Chanelâs relationship with Hollywood began in 1931, when Gabrielle Chanel was invited by movie mogul Sam Goldwyn, who sent a welcoming party that included Greta Garbo to meet her from her train. Chanel will stage a major Cruise catwalk show in Los Angeles in May, one week after the Met Gala launches the Lagerfeld exhibition. âIn New York, we celebrate 40 years of Karl â and then we head straight to LA to show a new collection and talk about the future. It will be a busy week for everyone, especially with [the coronation of] Charles III in between. But you cannot be Chanel just by staying in an apartment on the first floor of the 1st arrondissement of Paris.â In September, the V&amp;A will showcase âthe modern style of an era when star designers, of who Mademoiselle Chanel was one, defined so much of modern fashionâ, said Pavlovsky. âFor me, there is no contradiction between the past and future of Chanel.â",Guardian,24/01/2023,Chanelâs elegant show is the quiet eye of a Twitter storm at Paris fashion week,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jan/24/chanel-elegant-show-is-the-quiet-eye-of-a-twitter-storm-at-paris-fashion-week

Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter, aims to increase subscription income and reduce dependency on advertising. Advertisers have paused spending on the platform due to concerns about hate speech. Musk also highlighted the frequency and size of ads on Twitter and plans to address these issues. The company is facing a $300 million quarterly payment as part of the debt loaded during the takeover.","Twitter is planning an advertising-free version of its subscription product, as the company attempts to raise revenue and increase demand for its premium offering. Elon Musk has targeted an increase in subscription revenue as a key part of the social media platformâs business plan under his ownership. The Tesla chief executive tweeted: âThere will be a higher priced subscription that allows zero ads.â Twitter relaunched its premium offering for the second time under Musk in December, offering users perks including verified account status for $8 (Â£6.50) a month on the web or $11 a month for iPhone and Android phone users. Advertising accounted for 90% of Twitterâs revenue in 2021 but has fallen away since Musk bought the business last October, with daily revenue reportedly dropping 40% compared with last year. Advertisers including the carmaker Audi and the drugs firm Pfizer have paused spending on Twitter amid fears of a rise in hate speech on the platform, compounded by a botched revamp of Twitter Blue in November that led to pranksters paying for verified status in order to launch fake corporate accounts. Tweeting on Saturday, Musk added that despite the advertising downturn, ads were too frequent on the platform and âtoo bigâ. He added: âTaking steps to address both in coming weeks.â Musk aims to reduce Twitterâs dependency on advertising as payment looms for an interest payment on the $13bn of debt he loaded on the company as part of the takeover. According to reports, Twitter is due to make a quarterly payment of $300m this month, potentially as soon as this week. Musk told staff in November that Twitter might not survive a forthcoming downturn without a substantial increase in subscription income. âWithout significant subscription revenue, there is a good chance Twitter will not survive the upcoming economic downturn. We need roughly half of our revenue to be subscription,â he wrote in a company-wide email. Twitter Blue is available in the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Musk has likened Twitter to a âplane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls donât workâ and has flagged the prospect of bankruptcy for a business that he bought for $44bn.

While Twitter has a net cash position of $1 billion, it needs to improve its advertising revenue to service its debt. Musk could potentially fund Twitter from his personal fortune, but bankruptcy or debt restructuring remain possible outcomes if the situation worsens.


","Elon Musk sold a statue of Twitterâs bird logo last week for $100,000 â and he needs the money. The social media platform that he owns reportedly faces an interest payment of about $300m (Â£242m) on its debt as soon as this week, amid difficult financial conditions for the company. Twitter has been a loss-making business, even in the good times, but its problems have worsened since it was bought by the Tesla chief executive less than three months ago. Musk himself has raised the spectre of Twitter entering chapter 11 bankruptcy, although he has since played that prospect down. How much trouble is Twitter in, months after it was bought by the worldâs second richest man? How much money must Twitter pay banks next week? According to reports, the first quarterly payment on the $13bn worth of debt used by Musk to buy Twitter must be paid by the end of the month. Analysts put the amount at approximately $300m, or a quarter of the estimated $1.2bn in annual interest payments due. The debt, which sits on Twitterâs balance sheet and is loaned by a consortium of banks led by Morgan Stanley, comprises: a $6.5bn senior secured term loan facility (a bank loan); a $3bn senior secured bridge loan facility (a loan to tide over the company post-acquisition that, conventionally, is paid off with the proceeds of a bond issue); and a $3bn senior unsecured bridge loan facility. Twitter also has a $500m senior secured revolving facility, which is effectively a corporate overdraft. Can Twitter afford the $300m payment? Musk warned soon after taking over Twitter that the company could go bankrupt. He also revealed a sharp drop in advertising revenue, which accounts for 90% of Twitterâs turnover, caused by clientsâ concern over moderation standards post-takeover and a botched relaunch of Twitterâs subscription service, which led to a rash of fake âverifiedâ corporate accounts. The advertising situation has not improved. It was reported last week that Twitterâs daily revenue has slumped by 40%. Its cashflow â a proxy of its ability to meet debt payments â is poor and in 2021 it generated negative free cashflow (spending more cash to run the business than it takes in) of $370.4m. Musk had warned that loss was heading towards $3bn this year but now expects it to break even. Musk told a podcast last month that Twitter is ânot on the fast lane to bankruptcy any moreâ. He has also said Twitter has a net cash position of $1bn, which would at least cover next weekâs payment along with the $500m overdraft. âTwitter should have no problem making its interest payment in late January, which could be funded with cash on hand or its revolving credit facility,â says Jordan Chalfin, a senior analyst at the credit research firm CreditSights. âLonger term, the company needs to turn around the business, particularly its advertising revenue, in order to service its debt.â Can Musk fund Twitter from his personal fortune? To buy Twitter, Musk put in more than $20bn of his own money, alongside $7.1bn from associates and about $4bn from his existing stake in the company. Last year, he sold $23bn worth of shares in Tesla, presumably to fund his part of the deal. More than 60% of Muskâs remaining stake in Tesla has been pledged âto secure certain personal indebtednessâ, which leaves him with about $67bn worth of shares he can sell immediately, says Ben Silverman, director of research at VerityData. Musk therefore has the means to support Twitter financially, if he wishes. However, he said in December, not for the first time, that he was not planning to sell more Tesla shares. âI wonât sell stock until, I donât know, probably two years from now. Definitely not next year under any circumstances and probably not the year thereafter,â Musk said. Is bankruptcy or restructuring the debt an option? If Musk defaults on an interest payment, Twitter could enter chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, where a company is sheltered from creditors temporarily while it attempts to restructure its finances. This would put Muskâs entire equity investment, and the billions put in by his associates, at risk. Another option would be to renegotiate the debt. âWhen the banks look at Musk, they are looking beyond just Twitter,â says Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College law school. âThey are also looking at potential future business with Tesla, SpaceX. They may decide that itâs worth it to them to take 50 cents on the dollar in order to keep open the possibility of future business with Twitter and the rest of the Musk universe.â However, banks could seek a stake in Twitter as part of any restructuring, which would dilute Muskâs control. In the long term, Musk has to get advertisers back, or rapidly increase subscriptions to Twittersâ premium product, Blue, in order to avoid humbling options.",Guardian,22/01/2023,Is Elon Muskâs Twitter in too much trouble to cover its debts?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/22/elon-musk-twitter-debt

The sale includes items such as a neon Twitter sign, a planter in the shape of the @ symbol, and furniture. The auction is not related to Twitter's financial position, according to Heritage.

Heritage Global Partners, which ran the auction, has not released sales figures, but the BBC and SFGate caught a few highlights: A 10ft tall neon Twitter sign, perhaps a nice companion piece to the statue, sold for a mere $40,000. A 6ft tall planter in the shape of the @ symbol â which is, of course, an icon of the platform â closed at $15,500, according to SFGate.

The letter also accused Twitter of failing to respond to formal grievances lodged by individual workers. In the US, Twitter faces four class action lawsuits and 200 legal complaints from affected workers","A group of former workers at Twitterâs UK operation have accused the company of subjecting them to âunlawful, unfair and completely unacceptableâ treatment during a âshamâ redundancy process. A law firm representing 43 Twitter staffers who were made redundant has raised the prospect of an employment tribunal to resolve the situation, which it says has been marred by a flawed consultation period under the companyâs new owner, Elon Musk. âWe consider that an employment tribunal will take an extremely dim view of the companyâs failings to date, not least having regard to its size, resources and access to legal advice,â said lawyers at the British firm Winckworth Sherwood in a letter emailed to Twitter executives and seen by the Guardian. The firm said the redundancy process began for the affected employees on 18 November by treating them as if they had already been dismissed, despite a legal obligation to consult with people earmarked for losing their jobs for a minimum of 45 days. It said immediately cutting off employees from internal company systems effectively suspended them from their jobs when Twitter had no contractual right to do so. The letter added that blocking staff from accessing Twitter systems and premises made it âimpossibleâ for employee representatives to help affected colleagues effectively. Winckworth claimed this was a breach of the 1992 Trade Union and Labour Relations Act and that an employment tribunal âwould not hesitate to reach the same conclusionâ. The letter also claims there was a failure to establish fair selection criteria for redundancy, which it alleges is a further breach of the act. Winckworth said the companyâs cost-cutting justification for redundancies, which affected more than 180 people in the UK, was undermined by Twitter flagging âfuture opportunitiesâ in London on the career section of its corporate website. The law firm said in a âsignificant number of instancesâ its clientsâ jobs are not genuinely redundant. The letter says that the company claimed the postings might not be âactual advertsâ. Twitter made redundant around 50% of its 7,500-strong global workforce soon after it was acquired by Musk in a $44bn (Â£36bn) deal. Despite this, a substantial number of employees were contacted on 23 December requiring them to respond to invitations about individual consultations on redundancy. Some had been given deadlines to accept settlement terms before their consultations, the letter alleged. âInevitably, and perhaps intentionally, it caused much stress, anxiety and distress to those affected,â said the letter, which adds that Twitter has used the Acas arbitration service to secure settlements. Elsewhere in the letter, Twitter is accused of failing to respond to formal grievances lodged by individual workers. In the US, the company faces four class action lawsuits, and 200 legal complaints, from affected workers.

62,"Twitter has reportedly cut a dozen people from its trust and safety team, including those in charge of international content moderation and hate speech and harassment. The move has raised concerns that owner Elon Musk is dismantling the company's regulation of hateful content and misinformation. Musk has claimed that harmful content on the platform has declined since his acquisition, but researchers and rights advocates have found otherwise. NBC News recently uncovered dozens of Twitter accounts offering to sell or trade child sexual exploitation materials, despite Musk's pledge to prioritize addressing the issue.


","Twitter has made more cuts to its trust and safety team in charge of international content moderation, as well as a unit overseeing hate speech and harassment, Bloomberg reported on Friday. The move adds to longstanding concerns that new owner Elon Musk is dismantling the companyâs regulation of hateful content and misinformation. With Musk at the helm, Twitter has suffered a public relations crisis featuring sackings, resignations, tumbling revenues, reluctant advertisers and lawsuits over unpaid bills. The latest round of cuts affected a dozen people at Twitterâs Dublin and Singapore offices, sources who requested anonymity told Bloomberg. Among them were Analuisa Dominguez, Twitterâs senior director of revenue policy, and Nur Azhar Bin Ayob, the recently hired head of site integrity for the Asia-Pacific region. Employees in charge of Twitterâs misinformation policy, global appeals and state media were also sacked. Twitterâs head of trust and safety, Ella Irwin, confirmed to Bloomberg that several members of the teams were removed, while denying the cuts targeted other areas. âIt made more sense to consolidate teams under one leader (instead of two) for example,â Irwin told Bloomberg by email, adding Twitter removed roles in areas in the company that did not have enough âvolumeâ to warrant support. Irwin said Twitter would continue having a head of revenue policy and a head for its Asia-Pacific region for trust and safety. She also said the company increased staffing in its appeals department. Musk had been on a quest to overhaul Twitter since his $44bn (Â£36bn) takeover in October. The billionaire entrepreneur has outlined his vision for a âdigital town squareâ that enshrines free speech and healthy debate. He has also claimed harmful content has declined on the platform since his acquisition. But researchers and rights advocates found slurs, hateful rhetoric and malicious content to have thrived on Twitter since Musk arrived. While banned accounts belonging to far-right reactionaries were reinstated, several prominent tech journalists found themselves briefly suspended from Twitter last month. On Friday, NBC News uncovered the existence of at least dozens of Twitter accounts offering to sell or trade child sexual exploitation materials, an issue Musk previously said he would make a priority. Last month, Reuters â citing people familiar with the matter â reported that Musk had personally ordered the removal of a feature that promoted suicide prevention resources to users who look up certain content.",Guardian,7/01/2023,Twitter reportedly makes more cuts to online safety teams ,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/07/twitter-reportedly-makes-more-cuts-to-online-safety-teams

The Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has apologised after his Twitter account was hacked and posted offensive tweets about race, sexuality and gender identity. His team said they were in contact with Twitter to resolve the issue. This follows the hacking of education secretary Gillian Keegan's Twitter account over Christmas. The Commons speaker wrote to MPs in November to advise them on boosting security on their mobile phones with multi-factor verification, updating software and deleting old messages. The British army's Twitter and YouTube accounts were also hacked in July.","A second cabinet minister has said they fell victim to hackers and was forced to apologise after their Twitter account posted a series of offensive tweets about race, sexuality and gender identity. Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, said others temporarily gained access to his account and posted some âdeeply unpleasant stuffâ. The tweets were deleted swiftly, and his team said they were in contact with Twitter to resolve the issue. One of the posts on Heaton-Harrisâs account read: âWhy are black people so poor?â Another, captured by social media users, appeared to say: âWe are passing a new law soon, all transgenders and homosexuals will now serve 10 years behind bars.â Heaton-Harris sent a message to his 33,000 followers shortly afterwards. He said: âIâm afraid my Twitter account was hacked overnight and someone posted some deeply unpleasant stuff on my account for which I can only apologise.â The hack of his account will cause concern among government security officials. It follows another cabinet minister, the education secretary Gillian Keegan, also having her Twitter account hacked over Christmas. Her account was compromised for several days, and spewed out a series of tweets promoting cryptocurrencies. Keeganâs account responded to several other usersâ tweets with links to a website advertising bitcoin and dogecoin. Several days later, all references to Keegan in her Twitter name, biography, photograph and banner had been removed. Issues with tech security among MPs has become a salient issue over the past few months. In November, the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, wrote to MPs advising them to boost security on their mobile phones with multi-factor verification, update software and delete old messages. The warning came after Liz Trussâs phone was reportedly hacked by Russians in the summer when she was foreign secretary and frontrunner in the Conservative party leadership race. Hoyleâs letter to MPs, which included 10 security tips, said: âYou may not feel able to do everything on this list, but the more you do the less likely your personal information and mobile phone will be compromised, or the less damaging the consequences if you are hacked.â In July, the British armyâs Twitter and YouTube accounts also were reportedly hacked, with posts promoting NFTs â non-fungible tokens or digital artworks â and a purported interview with Musk about cryptocurrency.

However, they admit that Twitter's addictive nature may mean that people will switch to a more addictive platform. The author, who is hopelessly addicted to Twitter, suggests that Elon Musk may be their only hope for salvation from the toxic public discourse on the platform. They hope that Musk will use his platform to unite people for the collective good and use their ""cognitive surplus"" for something useful.","Where are we all going when Twitter dies? Mastodon? Hive? Back to sitting in saggy armchairs reading chunky books? Personally, Iâm hoping itâs the latter, but Iâm not optimistic. Twitter, of course, has been designed by a lot of very clever people to be extremely addictive, and if everyone switches to something else, it will probably be because itâs more addictive again, prodding all our dopamine-spiking buttons in some as-yet-undiscovered sequence with which battered airport paperbacks will be even less able to compete. Which, come to think of it, means it definitely wonât be Mastodon. Obviously, Iâm hopelessly addicted to Twitter, like so many journalists who pretend we are using it for our jobs. Iâve tried to tie myself to the mast like Odysseus, installing apps that block it at certain hours or force me to take a cooling off period before I refresh the page, but I always find a way around them. Even if you delete your account entirely, thereâs a 30-day cooling-off period, during which I inevitably re-up, like Odysseus with a pocketknife inside his tunic. Elon Musk, then, may be my only hope. Soon after his acquisition of the platform, a few waggish types suggested he might be deliberately trying to tank it â to make the public discourse less toxic, maybe, or just for the lols. Recently, that opinion has become less fashionable, but Iâm clinging to it like Odysseus to a fig tree â hoping that there is some galaxy-brain plan in motion in which Musk is prepared to sacrifice his fortune and reputation to let us get back to doing something useful. Author Clay Shirky talks about âcognitive surplusâ, the free mental energy we have to collaborate on projects that can be useful to humanity â and now Twitter is just a great big machine for turning all that energy into hot takes and Thanos memes.

The social media platform banned political advertising in 2019, but has since announced plans to expand its political advertising policy to align with that of TV broadcasters and other media outlets. Advertising accounts for 90% of Twitter's revenue, but after Musk's takeover, advertisers have paused spending amid fears of divisive content. However, Twitter has announced that there will be an immediate change for restrictions on ""cause-based"" advertising.","Twitter has said it will relax restrictions on political advertising as it seeks to generate more revenue after Elon Muskâs $44bn (Â£36.4bn) takeover of the platform. The social media platform banned political advertising in 2019 after its then chief executive, Jack Dorsey, declared that reaching people with political messages should be âearned, not boughtâ. Twitter has signalled a reversal of that policy, announcing it plans to âexpand the political advertising we permit in the coming weeksâ. In a post on Twitterâs safety account, the company said it would align its advertising policy with that of TV broadcasters and other media outlets. The post added that Twitter would ensure, as with any policy change, âour approach to reviewing and approving content protects people on Twitterâ. However, Musk has recently reinstated controversial accounts, such as those belonging to Donald Trump and Andrew Tate, despite pledging initially that such moves would be adjudicated by a âcontent moderation councilâ that has since fallen by the wayside. There will be an immediate change for restrictions on âcause-basedâ advertising, which it defines as ads that encourage people to take action on issues such as social inequality and economic growth. According to a Twitter advertising policy page, cause-based ads that target users in the US will no longer face restrictions such as a ban on using political terms like âconservativeâ or âliberalâ. Advertising is Twitterâs main source of revenue, accounting for 90% of its $5.1bn turnover in 2021. However, advertisers have paused spending on Twitter after Muskâs takeover, amid fears that divisive content would mushroom on the platform, while a botched relaunch of Twitterâs subscription service also alarmed advertisers by triggering a wave of fake corporate accounts.

68,"Since Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, the platform has experienced controversial and unpredictable changes. Musk fired senior executives and half of Twitter's workforce, resulting in a negative impact on revenue. The platform suffered a drop in advertising revenue and faced setbacks with its premium service, Blue, due to fake verified accounts. Musk lifted suspensions on banned accounts and announced a new content policy of ""freedom of speech but not freedom of reach"". Musk's reign at Twitter has been inconsistent, with him suspending journalists and causing outrage amongst employees and advertisers.","When Elon Musk walked into Twitterâs offices on 26 October carrying a sink, one day before he bought the platform for $44bn (Â£38bn), it was the first sign that the tale of his ownership would not be a conventional one. âLet that sink in!â he tweeted. For everyone swept up in what followed â from thousands of Twitter employees to advertisers and critical journalists â it certainly has now. Muskâs reign since has proved unpredictable and controversial, with the Tesla CEO losing the title of the worldâs richest man in the process. Here are some of the standout moments from those eventful past 10 weeks: Firing half the workforce As soon as Musk took over Twitter he fired senior executives including: the CEO, Parag Agrawal; Ned Segal, the chief financial officer; and Vijaya Gadde, the head of legal policy, trust and safety. Days later he axed 50% of the companyâs 7,500-strong workforce with affected areas including the communications team, the curation unit that helped counter disinformation and the human rights team. More departures followed a bizarre episode in which Musk set employees a mid-November deadline to commit to working âlong hours at high intensityâ and being âextremely hardcoreâ or leave with three monthsâ severance pay. This led to the departure of a further 1,200 staff, according to one estimate. Musk now says Twitter has about 2,000 employees. About the same time, it was reported that Twitter had let go 4,000 contractors in fields including content moderation and engineering. Responding to predictions of Twitterâs demise in late November, Musk tweeted: âWasnât Twitter supposed to die by now or something â¦ ?â However, the platform, which has faced warnings of technical problems after letting go so many expert staff, did suffer an outage on 28 December that affected some users. Musk said the firings were necessary because Twitter was losing $4m a day. That is an intimidating number for a business that must make payments of more than $1bn on the near-$13bn of debt that now sits on its balance sheet, as part of the takeoverâs financing. Musk said in December that Twitter was facing a ânegative cashflow situation of $3bn a yearâ but claimed the company should âroughlyâ reach cashflow break-even after his cost-cutting efforts. Alienated advertisers and subscription setbacks Musk admitted that Twitter had suffered a âmassive drop in revenueâ after the takeover, which he blamed on campaign groups lobbying advertisers about the future of safety and content guidelines under Muskâs leadership. The carmaker Audi, the drugs firm Pfizer and General Motors were among the brands that paused spending on the platform in the immediate wake of the takeover. This is a material issue for a company that made 90% of its more than $5bn in revenue in 2021 from advertising. The ad freeze deepened in the wake of a botched relaunch of Twitterâs premium service, Blue, which resulted in a host of impersonators taking advantage of the chances to launch âfakeâ verified company accounts for just $8 a month. Companies affected included the pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly &amp; Co and Muskâs own Tesla, leading to the service being temporarily suspended. Work is underway to repair the damage. Twitter is working with the World Federation of Advertisers, which says its membership represents 90% of global ad spending, on addressing advertisersâ concerns, plus Blue has been relaunched again without a resurgence of the fake account problem. The new service offers verified status â via a blue tick or checkmark â for $8 a month or $11 a month on their iPhone. Musk believes mass verification is the best way to defeat vexatious spam accounts, one of his Twitter bÃªte noires. Other perks promised by the subscription service include an edit button, a 50% reduction in the number of adverts in a userâs feed and the ability to post longer tweets. Reinstating banned accounts Musk has lifted suspensions on the accounts operated by Donald Trump, the British-American former kickboxer Andrew Tate â who had been banned for extreme misogynist posts, and was on Friday arrested in Romania on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming an organised crime group â and the Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson, among others. The account of US rapper Ye â formerly Kanye West â was also reinstated but then suspended again after he tweeted an image of a swastika blended with a star of David. At the same time Musk announced a new content policy of âfreedom of speech, but not freedom of reachâ, stating that ânegative/hateâ tweets would be âdeboostedâ and no adverts would appear near them. The reinstatements were another sign of the inconsistent behaviour that would mark Muskâs reign, coming weeks after he said no decisions would be taken on reinstatement until a newly announced âcontent moderation councilâ had met. He blamed the apparent backtrack on unnamed âpolitical/social activist groupsâ, accusing them of persuading advertisers to stay away. Suspending journalists In mid-December Musk contradicted his stance on freedom of speech by freezing the accounts of prominent tech journalists at CNN, the Washington Post, Mashable and the New York Times. He accused them of breaching a newly created Twitter guideline that barred users from publishing âlive location informationâ that would âreveal a personâs location, regardless if this information is publicly availableâ. This guideline had been created as an apparent justification for suspending, @ElonJet, a Twitter account that had long vexed Musk by displaying the location of his private jet via publicly available information. The journalists were reinstated days later, after Musk launched a poll on his own Twitter account that delivered a majority in favour of lifting the suspensions. But Muskâs targeting of journalists drew condemnation from the UN, the EU and campaign groups. Also in December, Musk released internal Twitter documents to select journalists in a project dubbed the âTwitter Filesâ. The documents showed the internal process behind decisions to suspend Donald Trumpâs account in 2021 and the platformâs response to the Hunter Biden laptop story. Another excerpt from the files raised questions about Twitterâs dealings with the Pentagon. Dragging Tesla into it Muskâs status as Tesla CEO is key to his fortune and had made him the richest person on the planet, before he lost the title to the luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault in December. The performance of the electric carmaker, in which Musk holds a substantial stake, has got worse as his interest in Twitter has grown. Muskâs involvement in the platform first emerged in early April with the revelation that he held a large shareholding in the business, followed weeks later by the deal to buy the company, which he initially walked away from â leading to legal action â before he returned to complete it two months ago. In 2022, Teslaâs shares declined in value by 70% to $123. Some of this is Tesla-specific, such as slowing demand and fears over Covid shutdowns at its Chinese factories, but Muskâs repeated sales of Tesla stock to fund his Twitter purchase â despite saying in April he had no more planned â plus concerns that he is focusing too much on the social media platform have also rattled investors. âMusk has lost credibility with the broader investment community as broken promises (selling stock again and again and again â¦.), the Twitter fiasco, opening up the political firestorm on Twitter, and brand deterioration for Musk and Tesla has led to a complete debacle for the stock,â said Dan Ives, the managing director at the financial services firm Wedbush Securities. âResigningâ as boss Musk said on 20 December he would resign as the CEO of Twitter âas soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!â His announcement followed a poll on his Twitter account in which users voted decisively in favour of him standing down. The pledge also followed court testimony in November in which he said he expected to âreduce my time at Twitterâ after an âinitial burst of activityâ. Whoever takes the job will be running a globally influential social media platform with more than 250 million daily users. But with a very demanding, and impulsive, owner. âOne of the first things I said after the acquisition closed was like, âweâre gonna make a bunch of mistakes but then weâll try to recover from them quickly,â and thatâs what weâve done,â Musk said on the All-In Podcast, released days after his announcement he was stepping down. But for the Tesla CEO, the biggest mistake â with a lower chance of full recovery â might have been buying Twitter in the first place.",Guardian,1/01/2023,"Slumping revenue, Tesla woes and a âresignationâ: Muskâs wild reign at Twitter so far",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/01/revenue-tesla-elon-musks-twitter-staff-investors
69,"Social media platforms are facing criticism for allowing the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories related to Andrew Tate, a British-American internet personality arrested in Romania in connection with human trafficking and organised crime. His followers have falsely claimed he was freed and suggested he was set up. Concerns have been raised about the impact on legal proceedings and the responsibility of social media platforms that helped Tate reach a wider audience. TikTok has said it will remove any content that violates its guidelines, while Twitter has not commented.


","Social media firms are under fire this weekend for allowing the spread of misinformation by followers of âking of toxic masculinityâ Andrew Tate after his arrest in connection with a human trafficking investigation. In the hours after his detention, TikTok and Twitter were flooded with posts falsely claiming he had been freed and conspiracy theories saying he had been set up, Observer analysis shows. Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said: âHaving conspiracy theories proliferating which might put at risk the integrity of an investigation or the safety of those involved is unconscionable.â Tate, 36, a British-American internet personality best known for his misogynistic views, was arrested with his brother Tristan in Romania on 29 December as part of an investigation into human trafficking, rape and organised crime. An investigation by the Observer in August into the former kickboxer and Big Brother contestant revealed that TikTok was aggressively promoting his content to users including boys and young men. Members of Tateâs online academy had been instructed to post deliberately controversial clips in an effort to boost engagement and manipulate the algorithm. After his arrest last week, a statement from prosecutors said four people, including two Britons, were suspected of being part of a criminal group that sexually exploited women after luring them with promises of a relationship. The women were allegedly subjected to âphysical violence and mental coercion through intimidation, constant surveillance, control and invoking alleged debtsâ and forced to make pornographic videos. Six potential victims had been identified. Further details of the specific allegations against Tate have not been made public. On Friday, it was confirmed that he would spend the next 30 days in detention as Romaniaâs Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism continues its inquiries. On social media, thousands of supporters have already reached their verdict. On TikTok and Twitter, Tateâs fans claimed without evidence that he had been framed, using hashtags such as #freetopG and #tateinnocent. âPeople lie because they hate Tate,â one wrote on Twitter. âIâm 100% sure Tate is innocent. FREE TATE,â said another. Others blamed âthe Matrixâ for setting him up. This was fuelled by Tate himself in a tweet posted after news of his arrest: âThe Matrix sent their agents,â he wrote on Friday. Since the release of the 1999 sci-fi film about people living in a simulation, where a man is given the choice to take a red pill and âwake upâ, the metaphor has been repeatedly repurposed in a range of conspiracy theories, as well by fringe online groups who use âredpillâ to mean men waking up to the ârealityâ that feminism subjugates them. On TikTok on Friday, the most-liked recent video about Tate was one that appeared at first to be a factual report but ended by asking viewers: âWhat do you guys think is the real reason Tate was arrested? Was it the Matrix, or did Tate actually commit a serious crime?â On Twitter, where Tate has more than 4m followers after his account was reinstated in November, many posts referenced #Pizzagate â a debunked theory that predated QAnon and claimed senior Democrats were behind a child sexual abuse ring â and suggested he was being used as a scapegoat by real paedophile rings. In a video made shortly before his arrest, after a Twitter spat with the climate activist Greta Thunberg, Tate had appeared on camera with a pizza box in front of him in what some speculated was a reference to the conspiracy. âThey want to cover up Pizzagate with Andrew Tate,â one Twitter user wrote, tagging Elon Musk. Other accounts posted old videos suggesting Tate had been cleared, despite him remaining in detention. One clip viewed 780,000 times on Twitter by Saturday claimed to show him being freed from custody. âAndrew Tate got Released Matrix attack Failed,â the caption read. The fierce defence of Tate and spread of misinformation since his arrest will add to concerns about the impact on any future legal proceedings and raise questions for the social media platforms that helped propel him to the mainstream.

Elon Musk has given internal documents and conversations to selected journalists, causing controversy over Twitter's moderation practices. Some see it as evidence of collusion to silence conservatives, while others view it as a publicity exercise. The use of algorithms to ""deamplify"" tweets and the criteria for banning users are questioned. Twitter's censorship and political bias have increased concerns, and more transparency is needed. However, Musk dismissed a request for academic researchers to inspect the data.","Half the room is jumping up and down, screaming âGotcha!â. The other half shrugs its shoulders, muttering âSo whatâs new?â. Welcome to the war over the so-called Twitter Files. Over the past month, Twitterâs new owner, Elon Musk, has made available to a handpicked group of journalists internal documents and conversations that took place before his takeover. They are mainly discussions about who and what should be moderated or banned, ranging from the Hunter Biden laptop story to the question of whether to remove Donald Trump from the platform. The journalists have made public selected slices of the data through a drip feed of Twitter threads. For some, the Twitter Files provide evidence of collusion between tech companies, liberal politicians and the âdeep stateâ to silence conservatives. For others, they constitute little more than a publicity exercise that told us nothing that we did not know. As someone who has long made a case for the importance of free speech, I think we should take the Twitter Files seriously, but also look at the discussion with a sceptical eye, given that much of it is framed by the culture wars. Consider the controversy over âshadow banningâ. Itâs a phrase much bandied about in debates about social media, but its meaning is contested. For the curators of the Twitter Files, âshadow banningâ means using algorithms to âdeamplifyâ tweets â that is, stop them reaching a wider audience. For the old pre-Musk Twitter, however, it meant something different â âdeliberately making someoneâs content undiscoverable to everyone except the person who posted itâ, as a 2018 blog post put it. The conflicting definitions have allowed the critics to accuse former Twitter executives of lying, although they seem as interested in putting the old Twitter regime in the dock as in uncovering the truth. The journalists curating the Twitter Files have presented deamplification as a secret process. Certainly, the internal mechanisms of moderation have been veiled in secrecy. As a practice, however, Twitter has long been open about deamplification â or âvisibility filteringâ as it also calls it â noting even in its terms of service that âwe mayâ¦ limit distribution or visibility of any Contentâ. Itâs a practice championed not just by old Twitter but new Twitter, too. Shortly after buying the platform, Musk tweeted that his policy would be one of âfreedom of speech, but not freedom of reachâ, adding that ânegative/hate tweets will be max deboostedâ â in other words, deamplified. But is it a good policy? Who decides who or what should be âdeamplifiedâ? By what criteria? And how different is this from straightforward censorship? Unfortunately, the polarisation of the debate seems to have overridden a nuanced debate around such questions. The Twitter Files also reveal some of the processes by which users are banned. Twitter insists that it does not suspend accounts for âpolitical reasonsâ. Thatâs hard to square with the evidence. Take the controversy over Trump. Twitter executives held anguished discussions about how to deal with the president, recognising the dangers of banning a democratically elected leader. Nevertheless, as one executive put it, âthe narrative that trump [sic] and his friends have pursued over the course of this election and frankly last 4+ years must be taken into accountâ. In other words, Trumpâs politics mattered. After the 6 January riot at the Capitol, the pressure that Twitter faced led to the second argument taking precedence over the first. All this has strengthened the view on the right of tech companies as fomenting a liberal conspiracy against conservatives. Within Twitter, Musk tweeted, ârules were enforced against the right, but not against the leftâ. Yet a 2021 study suggested the opposite. Looking at millions of tweets in seven countries â Britain, America, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and Japan â researchers found that, with the exception of Germany, Twitter algorithms amplified rightwing politicians more than the left. They also found that in America, conservative news sources were boosted more than liberal ones. These results cut against the grain of conventional wisdom. It may be that thereâs a sharp divide between algorithmic decisions and those made by human moderators. It may also be that the high-profile censoring of rightwing voices is not representative of the mass of decisions. In the last six months of 2021 alone, Twitter censored an extraordinary 4m tweets â a figure that itself should give us pause. The political bias in those 4m decisions is unknown. There is little discussion, for instance, about the suppression of Palestinian voices, a practice that has continued under Musk. At the very least, we need more transparency about moderation. Yet, when Alex Stamos, of Stanford Universityâs Internet Observatory, asked Musk to allow not just handpicked journalists but academic researchers to inspect the data, Musk dismissed him on the bizarre grounds that âyou operate a propaganda platformâ. Musk seems more interested in being seen to âown the libsâ than in opening up Twitterâs inner workings. The most worrying issue the Twitter Files have exposed is the level of contact between the social media company and state security organisations. The FBI regularly holds meetings with Twitter executives, pressuring them to take action against âmisinformationâ, even when this amounted to little more than a satirical tweet, and demanding the personal data of users. Twitter, to its credit, often pushed back. Nevertheless, the Twitter Files do show an unhealthy relationship between social media and state security. Equally unhealthy is the response of many liberals who have become sanguine about the work of the security apparatus. There has been a remarkable partisan shift in American attitudes towards the FBI, with a huge swing in Democratic support for the organisation. Many now view the FBI as an essential weapon against populism. Many seem to have forgotten the sordid history of the FBI in undermining radical movements from unions to civil rights organisations. The insouciance of liberals and many on the left to such state interference in public life is disquieting. Twitter, we are constantly told, is not real life. Thatâs true. But, like all social media, it plays an inordinately large role in real life, a private company that has become an intimate part of the global public square. We need to keep that public square as open as possible. That is why the revelations of the Twitter Files matter. And that is why we need to understand their significance beyond the clamour of the culture wars. Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

71,"Australian actor Christie Whelan Browne talks to The Guardian about her recent work and life, including her experiences of publicly accusing Craig McLachlan of indecent assault and the subsequent media coverage and defamation suit. Whelan Browne talks about continuing to work and becoming a vocal ally for women who have experienced sexual assault. Despite still being trolled on social media, she is inspired by younger female performers who ""will not take the sh*t other generations have taken"".","Christie Whelan Browne cheerfully admits sheâll hit her âageing diva phaseâ any minute now. The Melbourne-based actor recently turned 40 and is at near-exhaustion point when we meet, juggling a new sketch comedy TV series, a solo stage show for Sydney festival and grabbing a few moments on FaceTime with her almost two-year-old son Duke. âHe doesnât understand that Iâm away, heâs too little,â Whelan Browne says. âFor me itâs a new level of heartbreak. I was an absolute wreck the first week away from him.â Whelan Browne is sitting on the edge of a bed in her temporary digs in Newtown, Sydney, at the end of what has already been a long day. Immaculately groomed after a photoshoot, she veers from confident to cautious in the media spotlight, after the âugliest, most horrible four yearsâ of her life. Best known for her work on the stage, Whelan Browne has delighted audiences with her whip-sharp timing in Murielâs Wedding the Musical, Shakespeareâs As You Like It and Oscar Wildeâs An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest. On the small screen, sheâs starred in Shaun Micallefâs Mad as Hell and has just wrapped We Interrupt This Broadcast, a new Channel 7 comedy for 2023. She describes herself as a comic actor. âI feel confident in my ability to make people laugh,â she says, adding that her solo Sydney festival piece Show People â which premiered at Adelaide cabaret festival (under a different name, Pure Blonde) in 2015 â is âtragic and hilariousâ. Performing it comes as a welcome change of gear after four years of intense media coverage that overshadowed her talent. In 2018, Whelan Browne, along with two other female cast members, brought forward allegations of indecent assault against Craig McLachlan, the star of their 2014 production of the Rocky Horror Picture Show. McLachlan denied the allegations. In 2020, a criminal trial found him not guilty, and in 2021 he brought a defamation case against Whelan Browne, the ABC and Nine, before dropping the suit in May of 2022. Those were dark times, Whelan Browne recalls. She received death threats and rape threats. âThat really shocked me,â she says. âI copped anger and hatred from the media and the public and I just wasnât prepared for that.â The end of the court case left her feeling âa bit like a zombieâ. âThe next day, my son woke up at six, and life just carried on. I was back at work the next day or the day after,â she says. âIt wasnât until just a few weeks ago that I finally realised there is this big heavy monkey on my back and that Iâm going to need to address it at some point.â Whelan Browne says she lost work during this time and was fired from one job after she was sued for defamation. âThat was very painful,â she says. âBut I made it my mission to continue working, to make it clear I wasnât broken or beaten.â Twice during our interview she wipes away a tear, but she doesnât want it misinterpreted: âIâm only crying because Iâm so very tired. Please donât make it a sad story â because Iâm not.â Whelan Browne is now a powerful vocal ally on Twitter for women who have experienced sexual assault. âI know what it meant to me when people were willing to put their face and voice to a supportive comment, when others shied away because they knew it would provoke the trolls,â she says. âBut Iâm not afraid any more. I would prefer to be someone who uses their voice. I am never going to be quiet any more.â She is still being trolled on Twitter too, she says. When it happens, she writes âFuckhead alertâ to warn other women. âI donât want women to feel theyâve got no hope or that theyâre alone. I get people reaching out in my DMs asking how best to navigate the shitty situations women find themselves in. I donât really know what I can do other than calling out injustice when you see it.â Thereâs a long way to go, but Whelan Browne says sheâs inspired by the younger generation of female performers who âwill not take the shit other generations have taken â they just wonât,â she says. âThe young women I worked with on Murielâs Wedding were amazing at calling out anything they didnât like. They are far better at pointing it out and saying, âThat needs to stopâ, and that gives me so much hope for the future. They just donât have that same fear that I definitely grew up with, and that makes me so happy.â Show People predates her experiences on Rocky Horror. It began in 2015 when Barry Humphries invited Whelan Browne to create a show for the Adelaide cabaret festival, after her hit Britney Spears cabaret written by her collaborator and friend Dean Bryant. Bryant also wrote and directed Show People, in which Whelan Browne plays six roles: a new drama school graduate; a mum juggling performing and childcare; an ageing diva; an understudy; an older actor ready to retire, and the misogynistic leading man. âI was nervous to perform the show at first, knowing people would be wondering who the characters could be based on,â she says. âBut the truth is, they are all of us. I have been at least three of the characters myself and I will probably be more. Theyâve all faced obstacles along the way.â The careworn actor-mum has special resonance these days, she says. Whelan Browne was performing nightly in a play when Duke was only eight months old. She missed bath and bedtime terribly. âI thought, âThatâs it, I canât do theatre any more.â I think my time in that world might be done for a while. âIn my 20s and 30s I was striving for a career but now happiness is my goal. Happiness and less stress. A toddler helps with that a lot. When you are stopping to look at flowers at every single house along the way to the park and a 10-minute walk takes 40 minutes, thatâs when you realise how much beauty we miss in our busy lives.â Show People plays at Sydney festival on 12 January",Guardian,30/12/2022,"âIâm not afraid any moreâ: Christie Whelan Browne on Show People, Twitter trolls and her âhorribleâ four years",https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/dec/31/im-not-afraid-any-more-christie-whelan-browne-on-show-people-twitter-trolls-and-her-horrible-four-years
72,"Twitter experienced a global outage, affecting website users primarily, with over 10,000 user reports of problems. Elon Musk responded to users reporting problems by tweeting ""works for me"" and later announced significant backend server architecture changes. Concerns about regular outages increased after Twitter reduced its workforce, and Musk confirmed he would step down as CEO.","Twitter users have reported a massive global outage with many unable to access the website and its features for hours. According to downdetector.com, which tracks site traffic, the website became unavailable shortly before midnight GMT (11am Thursday AEDT, 7pm Wednesday EST), with outages most commonly reported on website rather than the app. Within an hour, the website had recorded more than 10,000 user reports of problems accessing Twitter. The London-based internet monitor NetBlocks said âTwitter is experiencing international outages affecting the mobile app and features including notificationsâ. âThe incident is not related to country-level internet disruptions or filtering.â Many users were still able to use the platform, while others were met with an error message that read âsomething went wrong, but donât fret â itâs not your faultâ. One user in Ireland reported âdifficulties logging into Twitter tonight â¦ Iâm supposed to be asleep but now Iâm watching news stories on the global twitter crashâ. Elon Musk, who bought Twitter for $44bn in October, responded to users reporting problems by tweeting âworks for meâ. Hours later, Musk tweeted that âsignificant backend server architecture changesâ had been made and that âTwitter should feel fasterâ. Concerns about longer and more regular outages increased when Twitter slashed, by some estimates, up to half of its workforce with little notice under Muskâs tenure. About 50 percent of Twitterâs 7,500 staff were sacked in Muskâs first week. In his second week, about four in five of the firmâs 5,500 contractors were released. The mass layoffs reportedly gutted teams that cover human rights, machine learning ethics, curation, communications and accessibility. In July, before the job losses, Twitter experienced one of its longest outages for years, with the social network unavailable to users on web and mobile for almost an hour.

73,"Mastodon founder Eugen Rochko has rejected offers from several US-based investors to invest in his open-source social network. The platform has grown in popularity since Elon Musk's $44bn acquisition of Twitter last year. Rochko said Mastodon's status as a non-profit organisation was ""untouchable"" and its independence was part of its appeal to users. The platform, which has surged from 300,000 to 2.5 million monthly active users after the Twitter deal, was dragged into controversy this month when Musk suspended its Twitter account for sharing a link to his own suspended account.","The founder of Mastodon has said he has rejected approaches from more than five US-based investors, as the Twitter rival grows in popularity after Elon Muskâs chaotic debut as a social media owner. Eugen Rochko, who launched the open-source social network in 2016, told the Financial Times he had received the offers from Silicon Valley private equity firms to put âhundreds of thousands of dollarsâ into the product. The popularity of Mastodon has surged since the $44bn acquisition of Twitter by Musk in October. Rochko said last week that Mastodon had jumped from 300,000 monthly active users to 2.5 million after the Twitter deal, which has seen Musk reinstate banned accounts such as Donald Trumpâs and temporarily suspend journalists at publications including the New York Times and Washington Post. Rochko, a German software developer, told the FT his platformâs status as a non-profit organisation was âuntouchableâ and its independence was part of its appeal to users. Mastodon has more than 9,200 patrons on Patreon, the online membership service, who are contributing more than Â£28,000 a month to the platform between them. âMastodon will not turn into everything you hate about Twitter,â he said. âThe fact that it can be sold to a controversial billionaire, the fact that it can be shut down, go bankrupt and so on. Itâs the difference in paradigms [between the platforms].â Mastodon was dragged into Muskâs controversial approach to moderation on Twitter this month, after its own Twitter account was suspended for sharing a link to the Mastodon account of @elonjet, an account that Musk had suspended for showing the location of his private jet. Musk also briefly banned all links to Mastodon and suspended users who tweeted their Mastodon usernames. In a blog post, Rochko wrote: âThis is a stark reminder that centralised platforms can impose arbitrary and unfair limits on what you can and canât say â¦ At Mastodon, we believe that there doesnât have to be a middleman between you and your audience and that journalists and government institutions especially should not have to rely on a private platform to reach the public.â Mastodon is made up of âinstancesâ, or decentralised servers.

Morrisonâs Twitter account was included in a sample of data released by an alleged cybercriminal last week. The cybersecurity firm that alerted the public to the apparent hackerâs claim said it was âlikely not a coincidenceâ that media personality Piers Morgan, who also appeared in data samples published by the hacker, has just had his Twitter account hacked. Most of Morganâs Twitter account content had been wiped, but according to reports, it had sent out slurs and abusive messages directed at the late Queen and at UK singer Ed Sheeran. Only Morrisonâs official email address, which was already publicly accessible, was mentioned as being included in the hack, and his phone number was also not listed, which may limit any potential harm. The hacker claimed the data had been âscrapedâ from Twitter via a âvulnerabilityâ in the site, and âincludes emails and phone numbers of celebrities, politicians, companies, normal users, and a lot of OG and special usernamesâ. The hacker offered data for sale âexclusivelyâ to Twitter for US$200,000 (A$300,000) in order for the company to avoid paying EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) fines.

By exploiting the vulnerability, people could patch together a data record of both public and private information â such as the private phone numbers and emails of high profile users. The bug was caused by an update to Twitterâs code in June 2021. It was patched once identified, but in July 2022, Twitter learned âa bad actor had taken advantage of the issue before it was addressedâ. That came after someone attempted to sell the email addresses and phone numbers of 5.4 million users. Twitter said it would alert users confirmed to have been affected by the breach. Those details were released in November, with reports at the time it could be the tip of the iceberg and no one able to confirm for sure how many users had been caught up by people exploiting the flaw.

Musk initially denied the removal but later said that Twitter did not prevent suicide. Twitter's head of trust and safety confirmed the removal was temporary and that the prompts were being revamped. The feature has since been restored.","Twitter has restored a feature that promoted suicide prevention hotlines and support groups after its CEO Elon Musk was criticised over their removal. The feature, known as #ThereIsHelp, placed a banner at the top of search results for certain topics and listed contacts for organisations in numerous countries related to mental health, HIV, vaccines, child sexual exploitation, Covid-19, gender-based violence, natural disasters and freedom of expression. Reuters reported on Friday that the feature was taken down a few days ago. Twitterâs head of trust and safety, Ella Irwin, confirmed the removal and called it temporary. Irwin said: âWe have been fixing and revamping our prompts. They were just temporarily removed while we do that. We expect to have them back up next week.â Irwin said: âGoogle does really well with these in their search results and [we] are actually mirroring some of their approach with the changes we are making.â She added: âWe know these prompts are useful in many cases and just want to make sure they are functioning properly and continue to be relevant.â Musk, who did not initially respond to requests for comment about the removal, had tweeted: âFalse, it is still there.â In response to criticism by Twitter users, the billionaire also wrote that âTwitter doesnât prevent suicide.â The initial removal had led some consumer safety groups and Twitter users to express concerns about the wellbeing of vulnerable users on the platform. Eirliani Abdul Rahman, who had been on a recently dissolved Twitter content advisory group, said the disappearance of #ThereIsHelp was âextremely disconcerting and profoundly disturbingâ. She added even if it was only temporarily removed to make way for improvements, ânormally you would be working on it in parallel, not removing itâ.

But he has reduced large portions of the teams involved in dealing with potentially objectionable material. Twitter had launched some prompts about five years ago and some had been available in over 30 countries, according to company tweets. In one of its blog posts about the #ThereIsHelp feature, Twitter had said it had responsibility to ensure users could âaccess and receive support on our service when they need it mostâ. Just as Musk bought the company, the feature was expanded to show information related to natural disaster searches in Indonesia and Malaysia.

78,"Twitter restored its suicide prevention feature #ThereIsHelp after briefly removing it, reportedly due to pressure from owner Elon Musk. The feature provided contact details for support organisations related to mental health, Covid-19, natural disasters, and other issues. Twitter head of trust and safety, Ella Irwin, said the removal was temporary to allow for improvements. Alex Goldenberg, from the Network Contagion Research Institute, warned that such a move would be dangerous and run counter to Musk's previous commitments to prioritise child safety.","Twitter has restored a feature that promoted suicide prevention hotlines and other safety resources to users looking up certain content, after coming under pressure from users and consumer safety groups. The feature, known as #ThereIsHelp, placed a banner at the top of search results for certain topics, listing contacts for support organizations in many countries related to mental health, HIV, vaccines, child sexual exploitation, Covid-19, gender-based violence, natural disasters and freedom of expression. Reuters said on Friday the feature had been taken down this week. Citing two people familiar with the matter, the report said the removal was ordered by the social media platformâs owner, Elon Musk. After publication of the story, Twitterâs head of trust and safety, Ella Irwin, confirmed the removal but said it was temporary. âWe have been fixing and revamping our prompts. They were just temporarily removed while we do that,â Irwin said in an email to Reuters. Musk then denied the feature had been removed, and called the Reuters report âfake newsâ. Nonetheless, the report appeared at the start of the Christmas holiday, a fraught time for many, prompting widespread concern. The anonymous sources cited by Reuters said millions had encountered #ThereIsHelp messages on Twitter. Eirliani Abdul Rahman, a member of a recently dissolved Twitter content advisory group, told Reuters the disappearance of #ThereIsHelp was âextremely disconcerting and profoundly disturbingâ even if the removal had been implemented to make way for improvements. âThis is the worst time of the year to remove the suicide prevention feature,â wrote Jane Manchun Wong, a software developer and Twitter user. âInstead of leaving a time gap without suicide prevention feature for a revamp, they couldâve kept the old prompt and replaced it with a new one when itâs ready.â Early on Saturday, Musk responded, tweeting: â1. The message is actually still up. This is fake news. 2. Twitter doesnât prevent suicide.â Online services including Twitter, Google and Facebook have for years tried to direct users to resources such as government hotlines if they suspect a user may be in danger. Irwin said Twitter planned to adopt an approach used by Google. That platform, she said, âdoes really well with these in their search results, and [we] are actually mirroring some of their approach with the changes we are making. âWe know these prompts are useful in many cases and just want to make sure they are functioning properly and continue to be relevant.â Musk has said views of harmful content on Twitter have declined since he took over in October. Then, he said, âalmost no oneâ at Twitter was working on child safety. âI made it top priority immediately,â he added. But Musk has reduced teams involved in dealing with difficult material and observers have said self-harm content is thriving, despite an apparent ban. Twitter launched the warning prompts about five years ago. Some were available in more than 30 countries, according to company tweets. In a blogpost, Twitter said it was responsible for ensuring users could âaccess and receive support on our service when they need it mostâ. Alex Goldenberg, lead intelligence analyst at the non-profit Network Contagion Research Institute, said his group published a study in August â before Musk took control of Twitter â showing that monthly Twitter mentions of terms associated with self-harm had increased by over 500% year on year, particularly among young users. âIf this decision is emblematic of a policy change that they no longer take these issues seriously, thatâs extraordinarily dangerous,â Goldenberg told Reuters. âIt runs counter to Muskâs previous commitments to prioritize child safety.â In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is at 800-273-8255 and online chat is also available.

79,"Photographs of the UK's club scene are important because they record for posterity the fleeting magic and mayhem of temporary scenes. Three archives and photographers have been highlighted as examples of documenting the UK's nightlife culture: Linden Archives, Museum of Youth Culture, and Liz Johnson Artur. The photographs capture different moments in time, from gay bars in the 1990s to illegal parties in the 2000s, providing a window to generations of party animals.


","Nightlife is an ephemeral thing. For all the joy and chaos of a big night out, our memories are often left behind on sticky dancefloors, bulldozed by hangovers or washed down the drain the following morning along with the sweat and the makeup. In the cold light of day warehouses converted into illicit dancefloors return to anonymous industrial sites, and in recent years the UKâs bars and clubs have faced the triple-pronged threat of the pandemic, the cost of living crisis and the relentless Pret-ification of high streets. This is what makes photographs of nightlife culture so mesmeric, and so important: they record for posterity the fleeting magic and mayhem of temporary scenes. The following archives and photographers help document the many fabulous and debauched faces of the UKâs clubs, pubs, raves and DIY venues, providing a window to generations of party animals. Linden Archives â Instagram Bored during lockdown, Stuart Linden Rhodes began uploading some of the thousands of photographs heâd taken of the gay scene in northern England in the 1990s on to his Instagram account. Rhodes started out as a nightlife photographer for All Points North magazine (terrible pay, but he got free entry to clubs), and later worked as the northern correspondent for Gay Times. By night, he travelled to venues across the country, photographing gay bars, Pride events and club nights, as well as the occasional celebrity. Lily Savage, the drag persona of Paul OâGrady, Julian Clary and young, Lycra-clad members of Take That can be found among the revellers. By day, Rhodes was a teacher in Harrogate. âIt was madness,â he says of his moonlighting. âI would get back to Harrogate, and the first thing I had to do for the Gay Times was pop the films in a jiffy bag, go to the post office at the railway station and deposit the film so it could get on the first train to London. Then Iâd go home, go to bed and go to work.â Because this was the era of Section 28 â the homophobic law brought in by Margaret Thatcherâs government that pushed countless staff and students into the closet â Rhodes used his middle name, Linden, for his photography work. But his colleagues in the staff room knew about his second career. âI used to take the mickey by saying that they were going home to do their gardening and play with train sets. There I was loading up the car with cameras and friends and heading off into the night.â Rhodes stopped photographing the club scene in the 2000s. By then the âdrug culture had taken holdâ, and the music had got too intense for his tastes. (Too much hardcore, not enough Donna Summer.) These days he posts a new photograph on @linden_archives every day, and the account has become a kind of collective photo album, where followers can take a trip down memory lane and comment on people and places they recognise. Out and About with Linden, a queer archive of the north, will be republished in 2023 by Pariah Press. Museum of Youth Culture â Instagram The Museum of Youth Culture has a similar nostalgic appeal, collecting photographs of people in Britain between the ages of 15 and 25 taken over the past 100 years, and inviting the public to send in their snaps. Among the submissions are fuzzy photos of raucous pre-drinks at home, women smoking cigs in social clubs, house parties in Manchester and pints and hairspray in Essex nightclubs. Originally a photo archive, the project was established in 1997 by Jon Swinstead, co-founder of the 90s fashion magazine Sleazenation. Unimpressed by the corny stock images of youth subcultures, he created the Photographic Youth Music Culture Archive (PYMCA), working with photographers to build a bank of images that he licensed to newspapers and magazines. In 2015, realising the potential of the collection as a public archive, the agency was relaunched as the Museum of Youth Culture. Today the museum is nomadic, popping up in different locations across the UK. A current exhibition at Coventryâs Herbert Art Gallery includes a scanning station where visitors can add their photos. Its Instagram account @museumofyouthculture, which combines the work of professional and amateur photographers, is a treasure trove of big looks and big nights out through the decades. There are photos of groovers on the soul scene, raven-haired goths at Sohoâs legendary Batcave club, pilled-up ravers with dummies and whistles round their necks and boozy nu-metal fans looking knackered post-mosh. Grown Up in Britain: 100 Years of Teenage Kicks is at the Coventry Herbert Art Gallery &amp; Museum to 12 February. Liz Johnson Artur â Instagram Born in Bulgaria, celebrated chronicler of Black British culture Liz Johnson Artur has been documenting nightlife since she arrived in London in the early 1990s, photographing MC battles, teenage raves, Notting Hill carnival and ad-hoc club nights. In the 2000s, she started following the clandestine instructions issued by Londonâs pirate radio stations for getting to illegal parties. âWeâd meet a man at a garage and heâd take us to some backstreets or up some roof,â she says of adventures that eventually led to a dancefloor. Part of the appeal of Arturâs photographs is their generosity. She always shows her subjects in a positive light: relaxed, part of a community, living their best lives. When I ask if she has a strategy for putting people at ease, she says there is no technique, only trust. âIn a club, people are in a place where they feel safe enough to let go, and there has to be an understanding. If people allow me in, Iâm happy to take what they give me.â Artur describes herself as old-fashioned and dedicated to the craft of manual photography. (She still uses one of the cameras she had upon arrival in the UK.) Her daughter helps with her Instagram account, @lizjohnsonartur, where you can see photographs from Arturâs formidable back catalogue alongside recent glitzier photos of Black celebrities such as Marcus Rashford and Michaela Coel. Works by Liz Johnson Artur make up one of the 13 displays of the ongoing Artist and Society exhibition, showing at Tate Modern, London. Chaotic Nightclub Photos â Twitter Pictures of the past often slip us into the warm bath of nostalgia â it seems easier to mythologise and cannibalise days gone by than it does to look the present in the eye. For readers wanting a distinctly unromantic view of recent British nightlife, Chaotic Nightclub Photos (@ClubPhotos) is the place for you. The Twitter account specialises in images of the kind of debauched and disgraceful goings-on you might expect to find in the corner of a Hieronymus Bosch painting: a man taking a secret wee while ordering a drink at a bar; someone projectile vomiting in the background of a group photo; a person passed out in the trough of a urinal; a woman attempting to swallow her own fist; police peeling people off the pavement after closing. Since it launched earlier this year, Chaotic Nightclub Photos has amassed more than 1 million followers. While the photos have no explanatory captions, and some appear to come from international clubs, other destinations are recognisable by the watermark logos of venues around the UK, suggesting theyâve been taken by in-house photographers. The images record the sloppy carnage familiar to every nightclub in every town and on every university campus, and the perverse joy of looking is only tempered by the fear of finding yourself in the background, pissed as a fart and doing something utterly regrettable. Dirty Little Club Babe â Instagram As a teenager in Hackney in the 2000s, Roxy Lee began taking pictures in order to remember nights out. The capitalâs squat-party scene has a long and anarchic history of turning boarded-up pubs, warehouses, office blocks and other abandoned buildings into improvised venues. Squat parties, Lee says, âwere always such temporary spaces. Iâm a very precious person, Iâm a bit of a hoarder. Iâm like that with my memories as well.â Eight years ago, when Lee was in her early 20s, she turned her lens on Londonâs queer scene. Her desire to keep a record of her social life was strengthened by the ongoing closures of many much-loved pubs and clubs: over the last decade, 60% of Londonâs queer venues have closed, in part due to soaring rents and rampant property development. The photos Lee posts on her Insta account @sausageandcustard are a riot of ripped fishnets, mirrorballs, jockstraps, outrageous outfits, poppers and drag queens, and an irreverent celebration of the hedonism and creativity that continues to flourish in spite of punitive economic conditions. What makes a good picture of a night out? âSexiness, in the broadest meaning of the term,â says Lee. âI love what people wear and how they present themselves. But fundamentally, the biggest thing is people just being themselves.â",Guardian,22/12/2022,Socials club:best Insta and Twitter accounts capturing UK nightlife,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/dec/22/instagram-twitter-accounts-uk-clubs-nightlife
80,"Elon Musk's actions as CEO of Twitter have been detrimental to democracy, as he has promoted far-right conspiracy theories, undermined content moderation, and banned critical voices. His worldview is anti-democratic and anti-egalitarian, aligning with far-right reactionary extremists. Despite confusion about his political leanings, Musk's actions speak louder than his proclamations. As a tech oligarch with immense power and influence, Musk constitutes a direct threat to democracy, and his trajectory is an accelerating process of radicalization. Twitter's influence on public and political discourse is undeniable, making Musk's actions all the more concerning.","On Monday, Elon Musk polled Twitter users on whether he should step down as CEO. The answer was a resounding yes. On Tuesday, Musk announced that he will step down once he finds a replacement. Still, the damage has been done: Muskâs tenure has been a disaster for democracy. Since Elon Musk took over Twitter, he has encouraged far-right conspiracy theories, consistently articulated rightwing extremist ideas and coddled extremists who propagated them, changed or undermined content moderation in a way that allowed hate speech and far-right abuse to flourish, and constantly derided Democrats, liberals and anyone he perceives as part of âthe Leftâ in an escalating crusade against âwokeismâ. He is now banning critical voices, including those of mainstream journalists, under obviously disingenuous pretenses. Muskâs actions are fully consistent with the worldview that dominates among far-right reactionary extremists. Yet, many observers seem reluctant to acknowledge that what is happening is exactly what it looks like. People who cover the tech world are still searching for a grand business strategy that would explain all this behavior. And some people whose main occupation is to cover politics are also struggling. The New York Times recently declared Muskâs politics âtricky to pin downâ, and said that âwhat he stands for remains largely unclearâ. The source of confusion seems to be that Muskâs actions collide with certain assumptions about the supposedly liberal tech world and with Muskâs own previous claims about his political leanings. But the male-dominated tech world seemed âliberalâ only because it was associated with technical progress, while most of the (predominantly male) tech oligarchs were happy to present a culturally permissive image. And people say all sorts of things about their political leanings and may even believe them â that doesnât mean we should take their proclamations at face value. What people actually do, the political projects they support, is far more relevant. So, whatâs up with Muskâs politics? There are more or less fruitful ways to tackle that question. It is not very useful to obsess over what Musk âreallyâ believes, or react to every one of his trolling attempts by trying to disprove and debunk them. We should instead engage the underlying political project â because it constitutes a direct threat to democracy and it is the reason why simply ignoring a man with such a powerful platform will not work. From a democratic perspective, itâs highly problematic that tech oligarchs like Musk are amassing so much power and influence. They are not democratically controlled in any way or guided by any concern for the public good. Musk is yet another example of how short the path from a certain kind of libertarianism to the far right is, a reminder that this type of libertarianism is driven by a desire for freedom from regulation and criticism of any kind. Musk believes that the world works best if people like him are in charge and get to do as they please, unhampered by regulations or demands for equality â because their interests ought to be the same as humanityâs. Itâs an inherently anti-democratic worldview that tracks very well with the reactionary idea that the world should be run by wealthy white men. This is what is pulling these people to the right, and why they eventually gravitate toward autocratic regimes at home and abroad. But what about the fact that Musk doesnât subscribe to all the typical âconservativeâ policy positions and never described himself as a âconservativeâ? Well, he certainly subscribes to the only position that matters on the right today: he is rabidly anti-âLeftâ. It has become dogma on the right to define Democrats, liberals and âthe Leftâ as an illegitimate, âun-Americanâ threat â that all measures, regardless of how extreme, are justified in the defense of âreal Americaâ against the âwokeâ onslaught. Thatâs exactly where Musk is. This doesnât necessarily signal a fundamental change of his politics and worldview. Itâs more plausible to think of his trajectory as an activation of reactionary sensibilities and an accelerating process of radicalization, but not an aberration. Much like other predominantly white, predominantly male elites who have been radicalizing to the right, Muskâs acceptance of democracy and pluralism was always conditional and contingent largely on whether or not it would be set up in a way that preserved their status at the top. That certainly doesnât mean Musk was ever on board with the idea of leveling traditional hierarchies of wealth, race, or gender â clearly, he was not. As soon as his elite status as an obscenely wealthy white man was scrutinized, his fundamental politics was activated. And now that inherently anti-democratic, anti-egalitarian worldview is animating the man in charge of the worldâs most important political communications platform, a virtual public square functioning as an essential part of democratic culture. Twitter could have been, should have been, so much better. But its enormous influence on the broader public, media and political discourses is undeniable. Twitter established a conversation between people in positions to shape the political and public imaginary â journalists, politicians, public figures â and people who would otherwise never have access to those levels of influence. Most importantly, Twitter has been instrumental in amplifying the voices, demands, and critiques of traditionally marginalized groups. Thatâs where it really demonstrated its democratizing potential. Much of the moral panic over âcancel cultureâ â which animated Musk to buy Twitter in the first place â is a reaction to the fact that traditionally marginalized groups gained technological means to affect the political debate. Twitter has been crucial in this uphill struggle: a tool for organizing, a platform, a global amplifier that enabled people with no traditional access to power to speak to powerful elites directly and criticize them in the public square. How valuable this has been is evidenced by the fact that many of those elites are so consistently bemoaning âpersecutionâ â and, like Musk, wish to sabotage and destroy this instrument for public criticism. To the extent that traditional societal elites â and elite white men in particular â face a little more scrutiny today than in the past, Twitter has helped to democratize public life. Losing this will hurt â it will hurt the attempts to finally make America live up to the promise of egalitarian multiracial pluralism, to become the democracy it never has been yet. It is a massive failure that those elected to safeguard democracy have seemingly cared little about this.

81,"Elon Musk has said he will not step down as CEO of Twitter until he can find a suitable replacement. He cited the company's finances as a reason to delay his departure. Musk chatted with Twitter users in a livestream about his experience and the necessity of cutting costs. He also acknowledged the company's debts, but said he had been cutting costs to ensure it would be cash flow breakeven by 2023. This follows a poll on Twitter in which users voted for Musk to step down, but he said he would only do so once he found a replacement.


","Elon Musk said on Tuesday that he will not step down as chief executive of the company until he can find a suitable replacement, citing the state of the companyâs finances as a reason to delay his promised departure. âI will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software &amp; servers teams,â Musk tweeted, before joining a Twitter livestream to discuss the companyâs situation with a former intern. It was the first time Musk had mentioned leaving the role as chief of the social media platform since Twitter users voted decisively in a poll for him to step down, which the billionaire launched on Sunday evening. But the acknowledgement was far from a firm commitment to keep to his promise. In the broadcast, Musk chatted with audience members about his experience at the company, and emphasised the necessity of cutting costs. Under his watch, Twitter is down to âa little over 2,000 peopleâ, he said, having been facing a ânegative cash flow situation of $3bn [Â£2.48bn] a yearâ until he arrived, describing the situation as ânet deadâ. âThatâs why I spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy,â he said, to ensure that Twitter would be âroughly cash flow breakevenâ by 2023. Even now, running the company is as though âyouâre in a plane heading to the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls donât workâ. Some of the companyâs costs, he acknowledged, were a result of his own acquisition, which saddled the company with $12.5bn of debt that it has to pay out of its revenues. But âwith the changes we are making here on massively reducing the burn rate, and building subscriber revenue, I now think that Twitter will, in fact, be OK next year.â This weekâs Twitter poll, sent in the wake of watching the World Cup final in Doha with Trumpâs son-in-law Jared Kushner, is not the first time Musk has said he will not run the company in the long term. In November, the second-richest person in the world told a court in Delaware he would reduce his time at Twitter and eventually find someone to run it in his place. Calls on Wall Street for Musk to step down had been growing for weeks, and recently Tesla investors have questioned whether his focus on the social media platform is distracting him from properly steering the electric vehicle business. Musk admitted in the court hearing that he had too much on his plate. He said on Sunday, though, that there was no successor and âno one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter aliveâ. Prior to Tuesdayâs tweet, Muskâs only response to the poll was to tweet claims that the results had been skewed by fake accounts. He also responded to a tweet suggesting only users who were paying $8 or $11 (for iOS subscribers) for a Twitter Blue subscription should be able to vote in the polls by saying Twitter would âmake that change.â The poll calling for him to stand down followed a series of highly criticised decisions by Twitterâs new owner. He first banned an account that tracked the location of his private jet, and followed it up with a mass suspension of critical journalists who reported on the ban. After users responded by announcing plans to leave to other platforms, Musk implemented a new policy banning all links to other social networks, including Mastodon, Instagram and Facebook. The change was made during the Fifa World Cup final in Qatar, where Musk was spotted in attendance with Kushner. By the end of the day, the policy had been abandoned, with Musk saying all major policy changes in the future would be decided by a vote.

82,"Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter has resulted in chaos, with employees fired, hate speech soaring, and advertisers fleeing. Musk's Twitter persona, characterized by his desperate attempts to be funny and liked, has been unmasked as disastrous. The weekend saw several journalists covering Musk suspended from Twitter, with posts linking to a competitor site marked as ""unsafe."" Musk himself ran a poll asking if he should step down as Twitter's CEO, with the ""yes"" option winning. Musk has said he plans to appoint a new CEO eventually, but he will remain Twitter's owner.","Since its launch, few people have embodied the worst of Twitter like Elon Musk. The site is a magnet for the self-involved, the kind of people who think a few likes and retweets confirm that they are always right; the types who walk through life with blinkers on and a mirror fixed directly in front of them. Through relentless efforts to be seen as funny, tweeting stale memes and tired jokes, and his transparent desperation to be liked, tanking his own stock price to delight his followers, Muskâs Twitter persona was infamous. But it was also a common type on the site: someone eager to be seen as in on the joke, a lovable troll, but, crucially, someone who is also actually bad at using Twitter on a basic level. The adulation of his diehard fans sometimes masked the fact that most people donât like these kinds of characters online. If this wasnât glaringly obvious before Musk bought Twitter, it is now. There has been little respite from the chaos of Muskâs Twitter since he took over just under two months ago. He is the constant centre of attention. He has fired employees and tinkered with core features as if on a whim. Accounts mocking Musk have been suspended, and hate speech has soared in this short space of time. As a result, advertisers have fled the platform, leading to âmassiveâ drops in revenue. What has made it all the more surreal is that, throughout this never-ending car crash, Musk has consistently tweeted every few hours, seemingly incorporating advice he receives from random users into the platform with almost immediate effect, and pondering major business decisions out loud to an audience of millions. But this tumultuous few months reached a frenzied climax this weekend â which may mark the end of Muskâs time as Twitterâs chief executive. On Thursday and Friday, several of the most prominent journalists covering Musk were suspended from Twitter after Musk claimed they had âdoxedâ him by sharing posts from a longstanding Twitter account that tracked where Muskâs private jet had flown (this type of flight record is legally public and not in violation of privacy laws, but the private jet account was also suspended). Shortly thereafter, users began to notice Twitter was marking posts linking to a competitor site, Mastodon, as âunsafeâ, removing tweets containing these links and preventing users from posting new ones with links to the site. The weekend ended with a poll posted by Musk himself late on Sunday night asking: âShould I step down as head of Twitter?â, saying he would âabide by the resultsâ. The option âyesâ won with 57.5% of the more than 17m votes. Whether Musk is sticking to his word is yet to be confirmed - though he has been active on the platform, replying âinterestingâ to several users who suggested bots voted in the poll, and tweeting that only paid subscribers would be able to vote in future. Though many predicted that Muskâs Twitter deal would be a disaster, few could have guessed it would have been quite as disastrous as this. But Musk is not alone: 2022 has seen some of Silicon Valleyâs most famous tech CEOs lose what sheen of âgeniusâ they still clung to. Mass job losses at Meta, after a year spent tinkering with Instagram and the metaverse, had many asking if Mark Zuckerberg had lost his touch. Redundancies at Amazon, after Jeff Bezos repeatedly blasted himself alongside various celebrities into space, have had a similar effect. In the case of Musk, the embarrassment he is experiencing may feel like a satisfying bit of schadenfreude. However, although Twitter is small compared with the likes of TikTok or even Facebook, it is â as Musk is keen to emphasise â the internetâs town square. And it has now been decimated as a result of his ego. Though it seems unlikely that he expected it to go so badly, Musk stepping down as chief executive may have always been part of the plan. During his testimony at a trial surrounding his remuneration package at Tesla on 16 November, Musk said he didnât want to be CEO of any company â not just Twitter â and that his role within the platform was temporary, with plans to eventually appoint someone else to the role. He has done this before: Musk ran a Twitter poll last year asking users if he should sell some of his Tesla stock, only for it to be revealed he had already agreed to sell a portion several days before posting the tweet. The past six weeks has solidified Musk as Twitterâs worst character, unmasking the desperation behind the trolling persona he has long projected. It feels fitting that the end of his tenure would come with a giant poll of his own making asking people to say whether they liked him or not. But even if he isnât in the CEO role, Musk will remain Twitterâs owner after he steps down, with a new chief executive of his choosing. The only difference may be a Twitter now being destroyed behind closed doors, rather than one whose destruction is live-tweeted, out in the open.

As the majority owner of the privately held company, no one can force Musk out, but a series of baffling decisions over the past few days has caused even some of his closest backers to break ties with him. A decision to ban an account that tracked the location of his private jet last week was followed by a mass suspension of critical journalists who reported on the ban. That led in turn to an exodus of some engaged users to other social networks, chiefly its decentralised competitor Mastodon, whose own account was banned for posting a link to the jet trackerâs account on the rival platform. On Sunday, Musk reacted by banning all links to other social networks, including Mastodon, Instagram, Facebook, and even minor platforms such as Nostr, used by the Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, and Linktree, a homepage creation tool favoured by influencers. That ban was rescinded by the end of the day, after a Twitter poll from the Twitter Safety account, with Musk saying: âGoing forward, there will be a vote for major policy changes. My apologies. Wonât happen again.â Musk has a history of using Twitter polls to rubber-stamp major decisions, selling a tenth of his Tesla holdings after one poll in 2021, restoring Donald Trumpâs account after a second last month and reinstating a number of suspended accounts after a third. âVox Populi, Vox Dei,â Musk tweeted after the Trump poll. However, in many cases, he has given the impression of already having decided on the outcome before posting: he had already announced a sale of his Tesla holdings, for instance, long before he put it to a vote, and his plan to reinstate Trump had been discussed since before he even bought Twitter. The idea of stepping down as chief executive had also been hinted at long before the Twitter poll was published. On 16 November, he told a Delaware judge that he planned to reduce his time at Twitter and âfind somebody else to run Twitter over timeâ.

84,"Elon Musk's recent pledge to step down as head of Twitter, after a poll in which 10 million users voted in favor of his resignation, is sparse on details. Musk's recent actions on Twitter, such as suspending accounts and banning third-party platform promotion, have caused backlash from users. However, Musk has had plans to reduce his time at Twitter, and has brought in close confidants to help him oversee the company. The big question is whether Twitter can be saved by a competent administrator, or if it is too tied up in US culture wars to be managed quietly.


","If he is a man of his word, then Elon Musk will âstep down as head of Twitterâ, after 10 million users voted in favour him ending his reign over the company he bought just 53 days ago. But the pledge in his tweet accompanying the poll, apparently made as he relaxed after watching the World Cup final in Doha in the company of Donald Trumpâs son-in-law Jared Kushner, is sparse on details. Hereâs what we know â and what we donât â about whatâs in store for Twitter: Musk has had a bad week Muskâs bad week started with his decision to act against an account that had been reporting the movements of his private jet, using a new rule written on the fly to suspend the account. He then suspended the accounts of some prominent journalists who reported on the furore, then banned any promotion of âthird-party platformsâ, after users began discussing where they would go when they left Twitter. The moves caused instant pushback. Blocking people from leaving is hardly a sign of confidence in your ability to convince them to stay. Users pointed out that Musk himself had said in June that: âThe acid test for any two competing â¦ systems is which side needs to build a wall to keep people from escaping.â Musk quickly U-turned on the journalism suspensions and third-party rule, and promised to put any future major changes to a poll of users. But the damage appears to have been done. Heâs been planning this for a while The suggestion that Musk would step back didnât come out of nowhere. âThereâs an initial burst of activity needed post-acquisition to reorganise the company,â he told a Delaware court last month in testimony defending his $56bn pay package at Tesla. âBut then I expect to reduce my time at Twitter.â Despite that, he insisted he did not have a successor in mind, gnomically tweeting that âthose who want power are the ones who least deserve itâ. However, he has brought in close confidants to help him oversee Twitter, with venture capitalist allies Jason Calacanis and David Sacks each taking on semi-official roles. Both men have a long history of running large companies, with Sacks staying on as chief operating officer of PayPal after Musk was fired as its chief executive, and Calacanis building the blogging empire Weblogs Inc, before selling it to AOL. He has experience as a hands-off owner The open secret of Muskâs success is that he only really runs two of the three major companies of which he is chief executive. While employees of Twitter and Tesla describe him as fearsomely hands-on, at SpaceX the day-to-day operations are overseen by the president and chief operating officer, Gwynne Shotwell. She joined in 2002, the same year Musk founded the company, and her job is still about carrying out his vision. These days that means reassuring Nasa that Musk isnât going to wreck SpaceX in the process of torching Twitter. Nasa administrator Bill Nelson told reporters last week that he asked Shotwell if Twitter would be a âdistractionâ, and she said it wouldnât. âI hugged her with a smile on my face, because I know she is running that thing. Sheâs running SpaceX,â Nelson told reporters. What does âgoodâ management mean at Twitter? The big question, though, is whether Twitter can be saved by a competent administrator like Shotwell â or if itâs too tied up in US culture wars to be quietly and soundly managed. Before Musk bought the company, Parag Agrawal was supposed to be exactly that sort of leader, promoted from the companyâs engineering department to take over after Jack Dorsey left. But in his short time at the top, Agrawal learned that running a social network brings you in to the political sphere, whether you like it or not. Whoever replaces Musk will have to deal with the same problems. And with Musk still very much the owner, and still embroiled in political sparring, their freedom to deal with those issues independently will be heavily constrained.",Guardian,19/12/2022,What we know about Elon Muskâs week and whatâs in store for Twitter,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/19/what-we-know-about-elon-musks-week-and-whats-in-store-for-twitter
85,"Elon Musk should step down as Twitter CEO to focus on his role as Tesla's CEO, according to The Guardian. Shareholders have voiced concerns about the risks of Musk's personal brand being tied so closely to Twitter, especially as the electric vehicle manufacturer's share price has plummeted by 62% this year. Musk's attention to Twitter is also a significant drain on his time and energy. Meanwhile, a Bank of England analysis shows that the EU-imposed cap on bankers' bonuses has resulted in inflated fixed salaries and may have made banks less safe, and the bank is calling for the cap to be removed.


","There are two theories about Elon Muskâs latest online poll. One says he was genuinely interested in whether Twitter users think he should step down as chief executive of the social media site. A second says he has already accepted that heâll have to give up day-to-day management and, in usual attention-seeking style, was creating fake drama around the event. The second idea sounds more plausible. Musk can surely see â as many shareholders of Tesla have been saying in recent weeks â that there are risks in tying his personal brand so closely to Twitterâs. The job of designing, producing and selling electric vehicles is not made easier if the public face of the car company is also at the centre of storms over who Twitter is banning or unbanning this week. âCustomers donât want their cars to be controversial. They want to be proud as hell to drive them â not embarrassed,â said Gary Black, the managing partner of Future Fund, whose biggest investment is Tesla, last week. Quite. Another consideration is the amount of Muskâs energy that Twitter is consuming. Having paid $44bn for the business (probably at least twice what it was worth), Musk was always going to play with his new toy for a while but any time-and-motion analysis would suggest that the sooner he gets back to the day job the better. Tesla, even after the 62% plunge in its share price this year, is valued at $475bn (Â£391bn) and the long-term value of Muskâs 13% stake is what matters most for his long-term wealth. So, yes, best to recruit a full-time Twitter boss who can bring some managerial blandness to placate the advertisers and staff. Muskâs subsequent tweet that âthere is no successorâ merely describes the situation today; he hasnât looked properly. The happiest people would be Teslaâs other shareholders if Musk decides merely to own, rather than actively run, Twitter. Black suggests the car companyâs non-executive directors have been putting the squeeze on Musk to get back to duties at the quoted company. That also sounds plausible. Somebody has to point out the bleedinâ obvious to him: Twitter is a hobby, albeit an expensive one; Tesla is a proper company that should be his priority. Cap on bankersâ bonuses was always flawed Those who regard it as a moral outrage that the government wants to remove the cap on bankersâ bonuses should read the Bank of Englandâs analysis on Monday of how the EU-inspired policy has worked in practice. Short summary: the cap just inflated fixed salaries; and it has probably made banks less safe. That is because the bonus cap, despite its name, does not constrain what an individual can be paid. Rather, it caps the ratio between the fixed and variable components of a pay packet. A bonus can only be worth 100% of salary or, if the shareholders agree, 200%. With high-flyers who had previously been offered, say, a 500% bonus, it didnât require imagination to see what would happen when a mechanical ratio was applied. Fixed pay would be boosted because the individuals would demand it. Virtually from the day the EU introduced its rule, banks invented ârole-based allowancesâ as salary add-ons. The consultation paper from the Bankâs Prudential Regulation Authority sets out the gritty details of how the system operates today. When the bonus ratio of a âmaterial risk takerâ â those covered by cap â gets close to 200%, their fixed pay tends to rise âmuch fasterâ than peersâ in the following year. âThis suggests that firms are choosing to increase fixed pay to compensate in-scope individuals as a consequence of the bonus cap constraint,â it says. The regulators call this outcome an âunintended consequenceâ of the cap, but could equally have said the EU was grossly naive to think bankers would just swallow smaller overall pay packets. In the real world, overall remuneration rates in European investment banking are mostly influenced by what Wall Street pays. UK regulators opposed the bonus cap in the first place for reasons of financial safety: a bigger contractual bill for salaries leaves less room to preserve capital in a crisis by slashing discretionary bonuses. It was a sound argument at the time, and it remains so. It is why the Bank is right to recommend getting rid of the cap now. Yes, the optics are terrible because âbankersâ bonusesâ is a toxic phrase. But the unfortunate reality is that the EU, having correctly identified that skewed incentives contributed to the 2008 crash, came up with a solution that didnât tackle the problem. The design of the cap was always flawed.",Guardian,19/12/2022,Elon Musk needs to realise Twitter is a hobby and Tesla is his priority | Nils Pratley ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/dec/19/elon-musk-needs-to-realise-twitter-is-a-hobby-and-tesla-is-his-priority
86,,"Hereâs a quick summary of whatâs happened today in business news: Elon Muskâs fate as Twitter CEO is uncertain after he released a poll asking Twitter users whether he should step down as head of Twitter. Over 57% of 17.5m users who voted said that he should. Though Musk said he would abide by the results of the poll, he has not made any announcements regarding plans to step down. A union representing Twitter staff in the UK cautioned that even if Musk steps down as CEO, he would still be owner of the company. UK spring budget will be delivered on 15 March, chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced today. The US Federal Trade Commission announced a settlement with Epic Games, the maker of popular video game Fortnite, for a total $520m. The agency said the company violated child privacy protection laws. Weâre pausing this blog for now but will return if any news around Musk and Twitter arises. Thank you for reading. Two California-based employees are accusing Tesla of retaliation after they were fired while participating in a group that was drafting letters critical of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The employees filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board last week, according to Bloomberg. The letters drafted by the group asked company executives to reconsider Muskâs return-to-office police, saying that they violated Teslaâs anti-harassment policy. Both employees were fired in June â one was told that their discussions on Tesla were âan attackâ on the company. A week after his arrest last Monday, former FTX chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried is appearing in court in the Bahamas, where is being held in custody. While Bankman-Fried had indicated he would fight extradition charges, it seems that he could agree to an extradition, according to CNN. In court on Monday, Bankman-Fried asked to see a copy of his indictment and then was granted a phone call with his US-based attorneys. Bankman-Fried faces eight charges of conspiracy and fraud for his actions at FTX and private equity firm Alameda Research. The European Union is accusing Meta of violating antitrust rules by âdistorting competition in the markets for online classified adsâ, the European Commission said on Monday. The commission said that it âtakes issue with Meta tying its online classified ads service, Facebook Marketplace, to its personal social network, Facebook,â it said in a statement. It is also accusing Meta of imposing unfair trading conditions to its competitors of Facebook marketplace. The tie, it says, âgives Facebook Marketplace a substantial distribution advantage that competitors cannot matchâ. The commission said its statement of objections to Meta is a âpreliminary viewâ after it opened an investigation into the company in June 2021 but does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation. It is unclear when the investigation will end as there is no legal deadline for an antitrust investigation. US senator Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to the chair of Teslaâs board of investors Robyn Denholm Sunday night saying Elon Musk may not be the fully dedicated CEO the company needs. âAs you know, it is the legal obligation of Teslaâs board to ensure that its CEO is meeting all his legal responsibilities as an effective leader,â Warren wrote, according to the New York Times. Warren inquired whether Musk sending Tesla employees to work at Twitter â at least 50 Tesla employees were pulled into Twitter since Musk took over at the end of October â is harming the company. She also suggested that Musk could be using one company to benefit the other, for example charging Tesla more for ads or readjusting Twitterâs algorithm to benefit Tesla, what could be antitrust violations. âThe problems identified in this letter are not merely theoretical,â Warren wrote, noting that Teslaâs stock has fallen as Musk conducted over his takeover of Twitter. She said there could be âsignificant legal questionsâ about the relationship between the two companies in the future. In a tweet on Epic Games settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the companyâs CEO Tim Sweeney said the settlements reflect how American regulatory practices are changing. âDevelopers should dig into the topic, as this settlement reflects state of the art American regulatory practice,â Sweeney said. While Epic Games is framing the settlement as a change in regulatory practices, the FTC says that the company knew the children were playing without parentsâ consent. âFirms cannot put growth and revenue over the safety and privacy of their users, especially children and teens,â said FTC chair Lina Khan in a series of tweets. The company âput children and teens at risk with privacy invasive default settingsâ. âNotably, our complaint states that these default settings caused substantial harm and constituted âunfairâ practices against both kids and teens,â she said. Epic Games, which the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) just announced agreed to pay $520m in settlements over privacy law violations, released a statement on the settlement saying âno developer creates a game with the intention of ending up hereâ. âThe video game industry is a place of fast-moving innovation, where player expectations are high and new ideas are paramount,â the statement said. âStatutes written decades ago donât specify how gaming ecosystems should operate. The laws have not changed, but their application has evolved and long-standing industry practices are no longer enough.â âWe accepted this agreement because we want Epic to be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players,â the company said. This is Lauren Aratani in New York taking over. Epic Games, the creator of the popular video game Fortnite, is agreeing to pay the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) a total of $520m for two settlements after violating childrenâs privacy law, the FTC announced this morning. The agency said the video game maker âdeployed design tricks, known as dark patterns, to dupe millions of players into making unintentional purchases.â The company is agreeing to pay two settlements: $275m for violating the agencyâs Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act, which bans companies from disclosing, collecting or using information from children under 13 and $245m as a refund to consumers for âits dark patterns and billing practicesâ. The FTC said the settlements are the largest monetary penalty for violating the privacy protection act and the largest refund in a gaming case. âEpic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive interfaces that tricked Fortnite users, including teenagers and children,â FTC chair Lina Khan said in a statement. âProtecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the commission.â Fortnite gained popularity in 2018, generating Epic Games $9bn in the gameâs first two years of existence. Wall Street has been trading for about half an hour, and Tesla shares have enjoyed a small bump. The carmakerâs value was up by 1.7% at the time of writing at $152.72 â less than the 4.5% move at one point in pre-open trading. Of course, that does not make up for the large losses endured by shareholders this year, but with a stock of this size it does mean a $5bn gain â Muskâs 13% shareholding would equate to about $650m in paper valuation. That would not be a bad return for most Twitter polls. Former Meta chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Nextdoor boss Sarah Friar would make for good candidates to lead Twitter, says the Financial Timesâs Lex column. Sandberg announced her resignation from Facebook in June, after transforming it into one of the biggest advertising companies in the world. She was seen as an âadult in the roomâ beside founder Mark Zuckerberg. Perhaps the same steadying hand could help at Elon Muskâs company. Friar was previously finance boss at Square, the payments company set up by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, so the FT (Â£) reckons she could help with Muskâs aims for Twitter to become a âsuperappâ offering payments, among other things. A rare Northern Irish (sheâs from County Tyrone, if youâre asking) transplant to California, she also has Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, and the universities of Oxford and Stanford on her CV. There is also a sting in the tail of the FTâs piece: it reckons that Twitterâs valuation is only just over a third of what Musk and his backers actually paid. That is value destruction to rival Tesla during 2022. Valued at about three times trailing revenue (equal to similar-sized peer Snap), Twitterâs enterprise value would now be just $15bn. So who is likely to take over from Musk as CEO of Twitter? TechCrunch editor at large Mike Butcher says itâs likely to be someone quite âcommercially mindedâ from Silicon Valley that can put Twitter on an âeven keel.â Butcher says no one thought Musk was going to stay in the job forever, and was likely under pressure from Teslaâs board, who have watched shares plunge following a string of controversies linked to his takeover of Twitter. He said itâs very likely that Musk will leave, itâs just a matter of when. Mike Butcher, editor at large at TechCrunch, tells Sky News that itâs very likely that Musk had a plan already in place before he issuing the Twitter poll. Elon Musk is very mercurial so itâs very hard to tell whether or not heâll actually abide by the poll, but itâs more likely that he already had a plan ahead of doing that poll. Itâs not quite clear what that plan is exactly, but Butcher notes that Musk issued the Tweet after landing in Qatar for the World Cup final. He says Musk âmost certainlyâ had talks with investors, given he has backers in the region who helped him take over Twitter in the first place. One thing you can be sure of its that heâll do whatever he wantsâ¦whether heâs said one thing earlier or not. Itâs as simple as that. So weâll have to wait and see. In terms of current management teams, Butcher notes that Musk is surrounded by people who âdo his biddingâ and that there is no longer a board to really speak of. âSo itâs really down to one man, pretty much all of itâ. The staff themselves have had to figure out what Twitter should be doing via his tweets rather than through any internal communications, as might normally happen inside any ânormal companyâ Itâs been a âtotally chaotic period under Muskâs leadershipâ, Butcher adds. A union which represents some of Twitterâs UK staff says that even if Musk does honour the poll and steps down as CEO, the social media firmâs strategy is unlikely to change given he still owns the company. Furthermore, the way Musk hinged his decision on the outcome of an online poll is yet another sign of the âdeep issuesâ plaguing the company under his watch, according to the Prospect unionâs general secretary Mike Clancy. Clancy said in a statement: This latest erratic behaviour by Elon Musk, once again underlines the deep issues over the way this company is being run. Whether or not Musk carries through on this vote, and is the chief executive going forward, he will still own the business. This means it seems highly doubtful that we will see a sea change in strategy. The way that Twitter under Musk has treated its staff has been appalling, riding roughshod over the principles that underpin UK employment law. What is needed is a fundamental change in approach, rather than more attention seeking, knee jerk decision making. In case Musk is on the hunt for a replacement, Snoop Dog had issued his own tongue-in-cheek poll and asking his own followers whether the rapper should replace the Tesla boss as head of Twitter: More than 10 million people voted in favour of Elon Musk stepping down as chief executive of Twitter in a poll he posted on the site late on Sunday. The billionaire, who bought the company and installed himself as its head just 50 days ago, has insisted there is no successor in the wings. âNo one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive,â he said on the social network. âThere is no successor.â Replying to another user who said they could do the job, Musk added âyou must like pain a lot. One catch: you have to invest your life savings in Twitter and it has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy since May. Still want the job?â Musk has a history of using Twitter polls to rubber-stamp major decisions, selling a tenth of his Tesla holdings after one poll in 2021, restoring Donald Trumpâs account after a second last month and reinstating a swath of suspended accounts following a third. âVox Populi, Vox Deiâ, Musk tweeted after the Trump poll. You can read the full story â including details of the chaos surrounding account bans â here: If Musk does follow through on his promise to âabide by the resultsâ of the poll there is one group of people who would almost certainly be pleased: investors in Tesla. Muskâs focus on the social network has come at a time when Tesla shares have been under enormous and sustained pressure. That has not been aided by Muskâs need to sell Tesla shares worth billions to fund the Twitter deal. Tesla shares have gained 4.5% in pre-market trading on Monday to above $157 â up from just over $150 at Fridayâs close, according to data from Google. The value of the company had fallen by 50% to $470bn (Â£387bn) over the course of 2022. That is still enormous, but less than the $1 trillion valuation it achieved in October 2021. Rival carmakers are catching up with electric vehicles and there has also been a broader rout in tech shares as rising interest rates diminished the relative value of future earnings. The US stock market benchmark, the S&amp;P 500, fell by 16% over the same time period. Dan Ives, a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, a US investment bank, said if Musk hands the reins of Twitter over it would be a âmajor positiveâ and allow Musk to stop the damage on Tesla. Ives has a price target of $250 for Tesla shares. âTime to end this nightmare as CEO of Twitter,â he said in a note sent to clients on Monday. From the botched verification subscription plan to banning journalists to political firestorms caused on a daily basis [it has] been the perfect storm as advertisers have run for the hills and left Twitter squarely in the red ink potentially on track to lose roughly $4bn per year we estimate. More red ink means funding gaps causing Musk to sell more Tesla stock which has been used as his own personal ATM machine since this saga began in April. As such, this has been a black eye moment for Musk and been a major overhang on Teslaâs stock which continues to suffer in a brutal way since the Twitter soap opera began with brand deterioration related to Musk a real issue. Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk. Attention focused on Twitter instead of golden child Tesla has been another big issue for investors and likely is behind this poll results with many Musk loyalists wanting him to leave as CEO of Twitter. With the poll closing this morning, it appears Muskâs reign as CEO of Twitter will come to end and thus be a major positive for Teslaâs stock starting to slowly remove this albatross from the story. All eyes will now be on Elon Muskâs own Twitter account to hear what his next steps might be. However, it is unclear when he will comment â not least because he may still be in the air. Muskâs private jet took off from Doha about three hours ago, where he was watching the final of the football World Cup. *There is of course an irony in reporting on the movements of his jet: the source for these data is an automated social media account on Instagram called Elon Muskâs Jet. Musk himself banned the Twitter version of the account, and several journalists covering his actions, after accusing them of âdoxxingâ him by posting details of his whereabouts. He then reversed some of the bans a few days later. Confirmation: Elon Muskâs Twitter poll says he should step down as chief executive of the social media company. There were 17,502,391 votes. 57.5% were in favour. 42.5% were against. *This post has been updated. The total vote figure rose by about 200,000 following the closure of the poll. With only about three minutes left, it looks very likely that Elon Muskâs Twitter poll will say he should step down as chief executive. Twitter polls are hardly binding votes, but Musk does have a history of following through on them. It is unclear what Muskâs plan is, given the lack of an obvious successor. Musk himself spent Sunday in Qatar watching Argentina win the football world cup. Pictures from the stadium showed him standing beside Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of Donald Trump. Trump, of course, used Twitter to his advantage during his US presidential run, and then started a rival social media company, Truth Social. Twitter briefly banned users from posting links to rival social media companies, including Truth Social and larger rivals such as Instagram and Facebook. And as chancellor Jeremy Hunt prepares for a range of City reforms in a bit to spur growth, the Bank of England has launched the first of a raft of consultations: this time on the banker bonus cap. Plans to scrap the EU cap were first announced during the September mini-budget, paving the way for bankers to earn more than 200% of their salaries in bonuses. However, recruiters and bankers are sceptical that it will spark much change here in the UK â where bankers have grown accustomed to higher fixed pay, which by and large rose to compensate for the bonus cap which came into force in 2014: However, the Bank of England said as part of the consultation: The proposed changes shouldâ¦help remove unintended consequences that have arisen as a result of the bonus cap, namely growth in the proportion of the fixed component of total remuneration, which reduces firmsâ ability to adjust costs to absorb losses in a downturn. The proportion of Twitter users voting for Musk to resign as head of Twitter is climbing with 50 minutes left to go: Yes: 57.6% No: 42.4% In a written statement regarding the UK spring budget, chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said: Today I can inform the House that I have asked the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to prepare a forecast for 15March 2023 to accompany a spring budget. This forecast, in addition to the forecast that took place in November 2022, will fulfil the obligation for the OBR to produce at least two forecasts in a financial year, as is required by legislation. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, will deliver the spring budget on 15 March 2023, according to Reuters. And for the avoidance of any doubt (given the controversy that followed the lack of forecasts alongside the disastrous mini-budget delivered by ex-PM Liz Truss and her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng) the Office for Budget Responsibility has been commissioned to prepare forecasts alongside the presentation, Reuters adds. Call it Chekhovâs Jet: a Twitter account placed on the mantelpiece in act one must surely go off in act five. Seven days after buying the social network he tweeted that his commitment to free speech extended even âto not banning the account following my planeâ. Six weeks later, his reversal of that policy set in motion a series of events that seems increasingly likely to end in his dramatic departure as chief executive of Twitter. On Thursday, Musk banned the @ElonJet account, claiming to be spooked by an apparently unrelated altercation with a man who was stalking his ex-wife. On Friday, he suspended the accounts of a number of journalists who had reported on his move. On Saturday, he suspended the account of Taylor Lorenz, a reporter at The Washington Post who had sent him a request for comment on the site, later claiming it was for âhistorical doxing offencesâ: breaking a rule that hadnât existed when she broke it, with tweets that were no longer live on the site. On Sunday, he reinstated her account, before immediately banning her permanently, for breaking another newly created rule: a ban on any promotion of accounts on other social networks, a policy apparently instated in a hurry over the weekend in an attempt to stem the flow of users leaving the social network for sites not run at the whim of a vengeful billionaire. Like the old woman who swallowed the fly, each time Musk reacts to the problems heâs caused, he creates bigger and bigger problems for himself. If his offer to step down is to be taken at face value, it would represent a rare moment of insight in his 50 days at the top of Twitter: the realisation that the only common cause of all of Muskâs problems on social media are Musk himself. Telsa investors seem to pleased with the way that Muskâs Twitter poll is leaning towards his potential resignation, with shares up 4% in pre-market trading: Economic data interlude: The German Ifo business climate data for December shows confidence among the countryâs firms rose more than expected, despite the energy crisis and high inflation. The index rose from 86.4 in November to 88.6 this month. A Reuters poll of analysts had suggested the reading would be closer to 87.4. A quick update on Muskâs Twitter resignation poll, which has now attracted 15.8 million votes with just two hours left to go: Yes: 57.4% No: 42.6% Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says Muskâs Twitter controversies are compounding other issues for Tesla, which is already grappling with supply shortages and increased competition. Scholar explains: The electric carmaker has been one of the worst performers in US tech this year, down by more than 60% following a meteoric surge for the stock of more than 1600% from the 2020 trough to the peak in 2021. Tesla has had the added pressure this year from Elon Muskâs Twitter acquisition which has distracted the billionaire, taking his attention away from the EV giant. Even prior to the Twitter deal, Musk was already spreading himself very thinly with SpaceX, Neuralink, the Boring Company as well as Tesla. Itâs also worth remembering that Musk used his Tesla shares to help fund his $44bn takeover of Twitter, which has also caused concern among investors. Musk has been using Tesla stock to fund his Twitter deal by selling a total of $22.9bn worth of Tesla stock this year in another sign he is taking his eye off the ball and weighing on investor confidence. Tesla has had a series of headwinds to grapple with from growing competition in the EV space, the global chip shortage, problems with the global supply chain and the shift in investor preferences away from technology. Investors remain cautious towards technology in 2023 and Muskâs Twitter distraction certainly doesnât help. Shares in Tesla, the electric car company that is responsible for making Elon Musk one of the richest men in the world, continue to suffer in after-hours trading. The stock price is down a further 0.77%, adding to further pain for shareholders. Tesla shares having plunged more than 62% so far this year â a fall that is partly linked to the continued controversies related to Muskâs forays into social media ownership. A quick check in on European equity markets, where major indices are trading higher at the start of trading: FTSE 100 is up 0.36% FTSE 250 is up 0.2% Germanyâs Xetra Dax is up 0.68% Franceâs Cac 40 is up 0.7% Italyâs FTSE MIB is up 0.6% Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at US investment firm Wedbush Securities, says Muskâs willingness to step back may be linked to the fact that controversies linked to Twitter have started to damage his âgolden childâ: Tesla. Ives told BBC Radio 4âs Today programme this morning that while Musk has not necessarily followed through with the decisive calls of Twitter polls in the past, this time is different: The last few weeks, few months, [have] been a black eye for Musk and a black eye for Tesla, and I think ultimately thatâs the golden child: that 90% plus of his wealth. And thatâs why I think the writings on the wall, and I think ultimately in the next 24 hours, Musk will probably name a temporary CEO of Twitter. Ives said itâs clear that Musk needs to stick to his strengths: He can build rockets and create electric cars. Thatâs why he is who he is. But when it comes to social media and to Twitter, I think this is a diff type of animal, and heâs realised he canât balance this as well as Tesla and Space X. And I think the writingâs on the wall that he cannot be CEO of Twitter. And as for how quickly we could see changes enacted, Ives reckons the executive overhaul could be triggered within hours. I think the pressure was building, I think ultimately, probably in the next 5-6 hours, itâs going to be the end of Musk reigning as CEO of Twitter. Full story: Musk sets up Twitter poll asking if he should step down as head Elon Musk has asked Twitter users whether he should step down as the head of the company, promising to abide by the results of his poll. Musk assumed the role of CEO at the end of October after firing a host of senior executives and dissolving its board of directors. Within minutes of posting the poll, more than 1 million people had voted. After 20 minutes of polling, when the yes vote gained a double-digit lead, Musk responded to a suggestion that he had already picked a new CEO, saying: âNo one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.â Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the economy, business and the financial markets. Less than two months after Elon Musk controversially bought Twitter for $44m and installed himself as CEO of the company, he is putting his fate in the hands of its users. Following a string of controversies over layoffs, new posting policies and temporary journalist bans, the billionaire issued a Twitter poll in the early hours of Monday morning, asking users âShould I step down as head of Twitter? I will abide by the results of this pollâ As of the time of writing, the poll had already attracted more than 14 million votes, with around 57% voting for his resignation. The poll is set to close around 11am GMT, though it is not clear how quickly Musk would step down if the majority of voters call for his ousting. It is also unclear who would replace Musk as chief executive. He said in a separate tweet, Musk said: âNo one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.â Meanwhile, itâs relatively quiet on the economics front in the lead up to the Christmas weekend, with the CBI industrial trends survey for December due later this morning. Stay tuned!

87,"A Twitter poll posted by Elon Musk on whether he should step down as CEO received over 10 million votes, with 57.5% in favour of his resignation. Musk has stated there is no successor in the wings and nobody wants the job. His recent controversial decisions have caused some of his closest backers to break ties with him. Musk has a history of using Twitter polls to make major decisions, but has also been criticised for giving the impression of already having decided the outcome.","More than 10 million people have voted in favour of Elon Musk stepping down as the chief executive of Twitter in a poll he posted on the site late on Sunday. However, the billionaire, who bought the company and installed himself as its head only 50 days ago, has insisted there is no successor in the wings. âNo one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive,â he said on the social network. âThere is no successor.â Replying to another user who said they could do the job, Musk added: âYou must like pain a lot. One catch: you have to invest your life savings in Twitter and it has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy since May. Still want the job?â On Sunday, Musk asked Twitter users whether he should step down as the head of the company, promising to abide by the results of his poll. When the poll closed on Monday, 57.5% said he should step down. As the majority owner of the privately held company, no one can force Musk out, but a series of baffling decisions over the past few days has caused even some of his closest backers to break ties with him. A decision to ban an account that tracked the location of his private jet last week was followed by a mass suspension of critical journalists who reported on the ban. That led in turn to an exodus of some engaged users to other social networks, chiefly its decentralised competitor Mastodon, whose own account was banned for posting a link to the jet trackerâs account on the rival platform. On Sunday, Musk reacted by banning all links to other social networks, including Mastodon, Instagram, Facebook, and even minor platforms such as Nostr, used by the Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, and Linktree, a homepage creation tool favoured by influencers. That ban was rescinded by the end of the day, after a Twitter poll from the Twitter Safety account, with Musk saying: âGoing forward, there will be a vote for major policy changes. My apologies. Wonât happen again.â However, the move was the final straw for some. Paul Graham, an Anglo-American venture capitalist who had only a month earlier backed Musk, saying: âItâs remarkable how many people whoâve never run any kind of company think they know how to run a tech company better than someone whoâs run Tesla and SpaceX.â Graham also declared the move âthe last strawâ and told users they could find a link to his Mastodon profile on his personal website. His account was suspended for the post. Musk has a history of using Twitter polls to rubber-stamp major decisions, selling a tenth of his Tesla holdings after one poll in 2021, restoring Donald Trumpâs account after a second last month and reinstating a number of suspended accounts after a third. âVox Populi, Vox Dei,â Musk tweeted after the Trump poll. However, in many cases, he has given the impression of already having decided on the outcome before posting: he had already announced a sale of his Tesla holdings, for instance, long before he put it to a vote, and his plan to reinstate Trump had been discussed since before he even bought Twitter. The decision to step down as chief executive had also been hinted at long before the Twitter poll was published. On 16 November, he told a Delaware judge that he planned to reduce his time at Twitter and âfind somebody else to run Twitter over timeâ. â¢ This article was amended on 19 December 2022. The headline and introduction to an early version suggested Elon Musk had said he was stepping down as head of Twitter after the result of the poll; while he stated when initiating the poll that he would abide by its result, he has not made any announcement since. The articleâs subheading was also amended to correctly refer to Musk as Teslaâs chief executive, not its founder.",Guardian,19/12/2022,Elon Muskâs Twitter poll: 10 million say he should step down,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/19/elon-musk-says-step-down-twitter-ceo-poll-tesla

Within minutes, over a million people voted, with the majority saying he should stay. Musk also commented on Twitter's policy to remove accounts promoting social media competitors, saying it would only apply to accounts whose primary purpose is promotion.

After 20 minutes of polling, when the yes vote gained a double-digit lead, Musk responded to a suggestion that he had already picked a new CEO, saying: âNo one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.â He also walked back the siteâs latest policy controversy, after Twitter announced that it would remove accounts that offered âfree promotion of certain social media platformsâ. Musk said the policy would be adjusted to affect only accounts whose âprimary purpose is promotion of competitors, which essentially falls under the no spam ruleâ. The platform earlier said the move would affect content from numerous social media websites, including Meta Platformsâ Facebook and Instagram, Mastodon, Truth Social, Tribel, Nostr and Post, but would allow cross-content posting. However, video platform TikTok, owned by Chinaâs ByteDance, was not included in the list. The announcement came on Sunday â the same day that Musk tweeted photos from the Lusail Stadium in Qatar, where he watched Argentina beat France on penalties to win the menâs football World Cup. Musk attended the game alongside Jared Kushner, a former US presidential adviser and Donald Trumpâs son-in-law. Trumpâs Truth Social was among the platforms named in the Twitter linking ban. On the initial policy change, the Twitter Support account said: âWe recognise that many of our users are active on other social media platforms. However, we will no longer allow free promotion of certain social media platforms on Twitter.â It gave examples of content that would be removed including âfollow me @username on Instagramâ and âcheck out my profile on Facebook â facebook.com/usernameâ. It added: âWe still allow cross-posting content from any social media platform. Posting links or usernames to social media platforms not listed above are also not in violation of this policy.â Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who recently invested in Nostr, replied to the Twitter support post with one word: âWhy?â In a reply to another user posting about the Nostr promotion ban, Dorsey said it âdoesnât make senseâ. Noam Bardin, the founder of Post, tweeted: âJust wanted to assure everyone that you can post any link you want on http://post.news. âWe make it easy to add all your social media links to your profile since none of us only use one platform. Freedom = Choice.â He added: âIn case I get kicked off this platform â¦ So long and thanks for all the fish â¦â Last week, Twitter disbanded its Trust and Safety Council, a volunteer group formed in 2016 to advise the social media platform on site decisions. The policy change follows other contentious decisions at Twitter since Musk bought the social network in October, including sacking senior management and laying off about half of its workforce. A number of major advertisers left the platform over concerns about its direction. Musk, 51, also suspended the accounts of several journalists after a controversy over publishing public data about the movement of his private jet. He later reinstated the accounts after criticism from government officials, advocacy groups and journalism organisations. The billionaire, who was warned that he could face EU sanctions over his initial decision, asked Twitter users what he should do. Nearly 3.7 million people voted, 58.7% of whom said he should U-turn on the ban immediately, rather than in a weekâs time. âThe people have spoken.

89,"Veteran musicians discussed the dangers of aging in the music industry following a Twitter rant by Mick Harris, a former member of Napalm Death. Harris attacked ""dole scroungers"" and ""benefit cheats"" in a video, leading to a debate among 90s rockers about the best way for aging musicians to tackle their senior years. Geoff Barrow, founder member of Portishead, and Sleaford Mods frontman Jason Williamson warned of the industry's destructive nature. The biggest killer is not facing your own personal issues, Williamson said. Harris has been criticised before for his political views, and many fans have struggled to reconcile their love of music with the star behind the sound.","The world of rock is a dangerous place to stay, with veteran musicians either damaged by the lifestyle or growing more out of touch with every passing year. This is the view of some of Britainâs well-known performers, responding to a rightwing Twitter rant from a one-time rock radical. The drummer Mick Harris, an original member of Napalm Death, launched an angry attack last week on âdole scroungersâ and âbenefit cheatsâ in a short video, full of crude language. This led to a lively online debate among 90s rockers about the best way for ageing musicians to tackle their senior years. Geoff Barrow, founder member of Portishead, and Sleaford Mods frontman Jason Williamson warned that the industry can be a destructive environment to work in for any length of time. Barrow said: âI think youâve [got to] realise when youâve had a good run and slide out the fire exit.â While rock rarely has direct links with party politics, many independent artists see a strong connection between their music and a liberal, if not socialist, outlook. Williamson, who has collaborated with Harris in the past, expressed shock at Harrisâ views, saying: âThe biggest killer in the music industry is not the corporates or Spotify, or conformity, or whatever. The biggest killer is not facing your own personal issues. It destroys all you initially gave, until all thatâs left is you in a room on your own with nothing.â Harris, 55, was in at the birth of the âgrindcoreâ sound in the 1980s with Napalm Death, originally famous for its ringtone-length songs and its left-leaning politics. The drummer left the band in 1991 and went on to work with Bill Laswell and release electronic and experimental music as Scorn, and then Lull. This is not the first time Williamson, 52, has had a run-in with Harris on the social media site. In May, Williamson claimed the problems between them began when he refused to work with Harris a second time â and then poked fun at his political transformation by comparing the bald and bearded man to Alf Garnett. Barrow, 51, was drawn into the row when he saw Williamsonâs Twitter posts and the opinionated conversation thread that developed below them, involving several established talents. âI think anyone still doing any music related work in their 50s â¦ are genuinely insane. And I know tons of them,â he wrote. âI donât mean insane in a good or bad way, I mean itâs a tough ride to stay independent and survive as a musician for so many years without taking on a normal nine to five.â Artists âwhoâve been in the business that long can kind of create their own universes and they become twisted when not challenged,â he added. âEspecially successful artist[s]. I know a few who properly have some strange ideas but go unchallenged by the people around them because they are famous.â The cliche of the ageing rock star with reactionary views is older even than the surviving members of the Rolling Stones, but it is still unclear what direction formerly energetic and engaged musicians should take in their later years, whether they are rich or poor. Should they follow Neil Youngâs view that it is âbetter to burn outâ, or John Lennonâs advice to âfade away like an old soldierâ? Lennon once railed against Youngâs lyric from Rust Never Sleeps during an interview a few months before his death in which he imagined âanother 40 years of productivityâ. The problem is that for those who live on, there are so many more opportunities to disappoint. From Morrisseyâs support of a far-right political party and Kanye Westâs antisemitism, to Ian Brownâs Covid vaccination scepticism, plenty of fans have struggled to reconcile their love of music with a distaste for a star behind the sound. Todayâs rock stars also find it harder to âfade awayâ. A 60s songwriter might have retired comfortably on the royalties from a few hits. But now even established performers need to keep up extra jobs. Harris himself works as a music technician, while Barrow writes scores for movies and TV series.",Guardian,18/12/2022,Go out in flames or fade away?

90,"The article describes Elon Musk's struggles with Twitter since he purchased it and became its reluctant owner. His contradictory decisions, maniacal tweeting, and lack of understanding of the social media platform have caused a decline in its value. The article suggests that Musk's dual personality, one of a restless genius and the other of a narcissistic man-child, is responsible for his mismanagement of Twitter. It concludes that for Twitter to succeed, Musk needs to be replaced by someone who knows how to run it properly.","Watching whatâs going on at Twitter is like watching a guy losing his mind in slow motion. The guy in question is Elon Musk, who once upon a time was the worldâs richest man and now isnât. (That slot is apparently occupied by Bernard Arnault, the luxury goods mogul.) Musk is in a hole but apparently doesnât know Denis Healeyâs First Law of Holes: when youâre in one, stop digging. The funny thing is that he dug the hole himself. First, he paid way over the odds for Twitter. Then, when Tesla shares (the main source of his wealth) tanked, and Twitterâs share price dropped, he tried to get out of the deal. That failed, so he was forced to borrow a lot of money â incurring interest payments of around a billion dollars a year â thereby becoming the reluctant owner of a loss-making company. And he hasnât the faintest idea of how to make it work. So heâs thrashing around, doing one contradictory thing after another. He started by firing half of the staff, including quite a few key people who knew how hard it is to run a social media platform. He demanded that highly skilled software engineers print out their code on paper so that he could give it the once-over. He rescinded the bans that the company had imposed on legions of rightwing nutters and then discovered that many advertisers, who are the companyâs main source of revenue, pulled out, anxious lest their corporate brands get tainted by proximity to lunacy, hate speech and white supremacist cant. He even rescinded the ban on Donald Trump, only to find that Trump was no longer interested in being on the platform. He took to sleeping on a sofa in Twitterâs San Francisco HQ, babbling about a âcode redâ crisis, the need to âclear the decks of any prior wrongdoing and move forward with a clean slateâ and describing the company as a âcrime sceneâ. To find some evidence for this, he commissioned two journalists to go through stacks of internal records of moderation decisions made long before he owned the company. Reports suggest that the documents merely show staff panicking about the radicalisation of the US right before and after the election and trying to react to events such as the storming of the Capitol building in Washington on 6 January 2021 â in other words, no smoking gun. And all the while, Musk has continued his maniacal tweeting. He tweeted a white rabbit, for example, which the QAnon crowd interpreted as a sign of support. He misread a blog post by the former head of trust and safety at Twitter and insinuated he was a paedophile, prompting others to label the man a âgroomerâ. (This chimed with his 2018 accusation that one of the team that rescued a group of children from a cave in Thailand was a âpedo guyâ.) The other day, he tweeted that âMy pronouns are Prosecute/Fauciâ â a multipurpose and daft insult revealing, among other things, that Musk doesnât actually know how this âpronounsâ business works. One could go on, but you get the point. The guy is flailing around and Twitter has become âThe Musk Experienceâ, as the blogger Helen Lewis puts it. Meanwhile, the worldâs media watch in morbid fascination. How can the worldâs second richest man â the guy who transformed the automobile industry and built rockets that can deliver payloads into orbit and return to land accurately and safely on ocean-going rafts â be making such a mess of reforming a mere social media platform. After all, that doesnât require rocket science, right? For the answer, we need look no further than Robert Louis Stevensonâs The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Elon Musk is our contemporary gothic horror story. On the one hand, we have Dr Elon, a restless genius who transformed PayPal and used the proceeds to build two world-changing companies. Nobody who has seen him at work in these outfits doubts that he is fully on top of the technology and the business. Watch him on a tour of a SpaceX installation, for example, talking to the engineers who are building the kit and you see a CEO who really knows what he â and they â are doing. Likewise, ask him whatâs special about the electric motors in the Tesla Model 3 or the Model S Plaid and youâre in for an interesting hourâs tutorial. In that sense, Dr Elon is the spiritual heir of Henry Ford, the genius who invented a new way of manufacturing complicated products at scale and, in doing so, changed the world. And then, on the other hand, we have Mr Musk, a narcissistic man-child with a pathetic craving for attention, the attention span of a newt and a maximalist interpretation of what is meant by âfree speechâ. This creature now controls a platform that plays a small but significant role in the global public sphere. Run properly and with a viable business model, Twitter could continue to play a useful role in our lives. But for that to happen, Dr Elon would have to be in charge.

However, the articles written by the journalists did not include information about Musk's real-time location or that of his family members. The suspension was widely condemned by media organizations, the EU, and the United Nations. After the poll results, Musk lifted the ban and some users returned to the platform","Elon Musk has lifted the suspensions of the Twitter accounts of several journalists he had banned a day earlier, after the second poll he conducted on the topic went against his preferred outcome. On Thursday, Musk suspended a group of tech journalists from the website, including Ryan Mac from the New York Times, Drew Harwell of the Washington Post and CNNâs Donie OâSullivan, for what he said were breaches of the companyâs new rule about revealing peopleâs locations. After an initial poll supported an immediate reversal of the bans on Thursday, Musk said there were too many options, and ran another poll for 24 hours with just two options: to keep the ban in place for seven days, or lift the ban immediately. After close to 3.7m votes, users voted to lift the ban 58.7% to 41.3%. In a tweet shortly after, Musk said he would lift the bans, and several of those users returned to the platform. âThe people have spoken,â Musk tweeted. The new rule bars users from publishing âlive location informationâ that would âreveal a personâs location, regardless if this information is publicly availableâ. Musk claimed the journalists had âdoxxedâ him, but in fact they had recently published articles about Muskâs suspension of a Twitter account that had shared publicly available data about the movements of his private jet. The articles written by several of the reporters before their accounts were suspended did not include information about Muskâs real-time location, or the location of any of his family members. The ElonJet account that was dedicated to tweeting the location of his private jet remained suspended at the time of reporting. The suspension of the accounts of reporters who cover Musk was widely condemned by their employers, other media organisations, the EU and the United Nations. It was a chaotic 24 hours on Twitter even by the standard set by Musk since he took over the platform. In a Twitter Spaces event after the suspensions were announced, Musk briefly entered and was questioned by some of the journalists who had their accounts suspended, but were nevertheless able to participate in the Spaces event. He said journalists were not being treated differently to other citizens. âIf you doxx, you get suspended. Thatâs it. End of story.â After further questioning from the host, BuzzFeed News tech reporter Katie Notopoulos, Musk left the event, and not long after the Space abruptly ended and was then deleted entirely by Twitter. Then Twitter took the entire Spaces product offline for almost a day, with Musk saying a âlegacy bugâ needed to be fixed. After it returned, Notopoulos found she had been banned from Spaces. Twitter also targeted its nearest rival, Mastodon, banning linking to several Mastodon servers and blocking users from adding their Mastodon username to their profile.",Guardian,17/12/2022,Elon Musk reinstates Twitter accounts of suspended journalists ,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/17/elon-musk-reinstates-twitter-accounts-of-suspended-journalists

93,"Several journalists reporting on Elon Musk and Twitter have been suspended or banned from the platform after Musk accused them of posting his real-time location and ""assassination coordinates."" Journalists from CNN, the Washington Post, Mashable, and the New York Times were affected, along with Mastodon and individual Mastodon accounts. Musk claimed that doxxing his location and endangering his family was not acceptable, while the suspended journalists argued that their articles did not include such information. Musk later stated that the suspensions would be for only seven days.


","A number of prominent journalists who have reported on Twitter and its new chief executive, Elon Musk, appear to have been suspended or banned from the platform. In a series of evening tweets, Musk wrote that sharing his real-time location on Twitter was forbidden, and accused journalists who he alleged had been sharing information about his location of posting âassassination coordinatesâ. Accounts of tech journalists at CNN, the Washington Post, Mashable and the New York Times were suspended in quick succession on Thursday evening. All had recently published articles about Muskâs suspension of a Twitter account that had shared publicly available data about the movements of his private jet. Each of these articles had highlighted the tension between Muskâs stated commitment to âfree speechâ and his choice to ban an account that he personally disliked. The Twitter account for rival social media company, Mastodon â which some Twitter users have migrated to after Muskâs takeover of Twitter â also appeared to have been suspended. Links to individual Mastodon accounts also appeared to be banned. An error message notified some users that links to Mastodon had been âidentifiedâ as âpotentially harmfulâ by Twitter or its partners. Ryan Mac, a New York Times tech reporter, wrote on a new Twitter account that he was given âno warningâ before his account was suspended and that he had received no communication from the company about the reason his account was âpermanently suspendedâ. The Washington Post said in a statement that the suspension of their technology reporter, Drew Harwell, âundermines Elon Muskâs claim that he intends to run Twitter as a platform dedicated to free speechâ. CNN said in its statement: âTwitterâs increasing instability and volatility should be of incredible concern to everyone who uses the platform.â âMusk just seems to be stamping out accounts that he doesnât like,â Donie OâSullivan, one of the journalists whose account was abruptly suspended, told CNNâs Anderson Cooper. The Committee to Protect Journalists said that if individualâs bans were confirmed as retaliation for journalistsâ work, it would be a âserious violation of journalistsâ right to report the news without fear of reprisalâ. In a series of late-night tweets on Thursday, Musk said: âCriticizing me all day long is totally fine, but doxxing my real-time location and endangering my family is not.â He added that the âsame doxxing rules apply to âjournalistsâ as to everyone elseâ and wrote: âThey posted my exact real-time location, basically assassination coordinates, in (obvious) direct violation of Twitter terms of service.â Musk did not clarify in what way he believed the reporters who were suspended had shared his âexact real-time locationâ. The news articles about Musk that several reporters had published before their accounts were suspended did not include any information about his real-time location, or the location of any of his family members. The articles were focused on ElonJet, an account that had posted the location of the billionaireâs private jet as it travelled to different cities. In a Twitter spaces event, Musk was questioned about the bans by some of the journalists who had their accounts suspended. Musk said journalists were not being treated differently to other citizens, and âif you doxx, you get suspended. Thatâs it. End of story.â While the journalists had reported that the suspensions were permanent, in multiple tweets Musk said the suspensions would be for only seven days. âSome time away from Twitter is good for the soul â¦â Musk tweeted. He subsequently tweeted a poll asking people whether the ban should be lifted now, tomorrow, in seven days or longer. The poll went in favour of immediately unbanning the users, with 43% of the over half a million votes going with ânowâ. Musk then tweeted that he would redo the poll because there were too many options, narrowing it to now or in seven days. It is similar to the poll launched by Musk that resulted in former US president Donald Trump being unbanned from the platform. At least two of the reporters whose accounts were suspended had reportedly tweeted about a public statement from the Los Angeles police department, responding to an allegation Musk had made about an incident in LA in which he said a stalker had targeted a car, believing it was his. Donie OâSullivan, the CNN reporter whose account was suspended, is one of the countryâs leading reporters on conspiracy theories and disinformation, and had shared a comment from the LAPD about Musk shortly before he was suspended. Matt Binder, the Mashable reporter whose account was suspended, âwas tweeting about OâSullivanâs suspension when his account also went darkâ, the Washington Post reported. Twitter, which recently dissolved the majority of its press department, did not immediately respond to request for comment. But Twitterâs head of trust and safety told the Verge: âWithout commenting on any specific accounts, I can confirm that we will suspend any accounts that violate our privacy policies and put other users at risk.â",Guardian,16/12/2022,Twitter suspends accounts of several journalists who had reported on Elon Musk,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/15/twitter-suspends-accounts-journalists-musk
94,"Twitter suspended the account @ElonJet, which tracks Elon Musk's private jet, for violating rules but later restored it. Musk suspended it again, along with other bot accounts run by Florida college student Jack Sweeney, who tracks the planes of various celebrities and Russian oligarchs. Sweeney claimed that Twitter had also shadowbanned his account. Musk had previously asked Sweeney to take down the account for security reasons. The incident highlights concerns about Musk's unilateral control over content decisions on Twitter.


","Twitter on Wednesday suspended an account that monitors the flight paths of a private jet owned by the social media giantâs new boss, Elon Musk. Later that evening, the account, @ElonJet, confirmed via tweet it was back online after being suspended for âviolat[ing ] Twitter rulesâ. An hour later, Musk again suspended the jet-tracking account after imposing new conditions on all of Twitterâs users that the sharing of anyoneâs current location was not allowed. The account is run by Jack Sweeney, a Florida college student and aviation enthusiast who ran similar âbotâ accounts tracking other celebritiesâ airplanes. For hours after the suspension of the @elonjet account, other Sweeney-run accounts tracking private jets used by Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and various Russian oligarchs were still live on Twitter. But by later on Wednesday, Twitter suspended all of them, including Sweeneyâs personal account. He also operates accounts tracking Muskâs jet on rival social platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. After Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine in February, the account also began tracking the flight paths of various Russian oligarchs. The decision to suspend the account underscored concerns about the new Twitter CEOâs unilateral control over content decisions on the platform. On 7 November, shortly after acquiring Twitter for $44bn, Musk tweeted: âMy commitment to free speech extends even to not banning the account following my plane, even though that is a direct personal safety risk.â But on Wednesday morning, Sweeney tweeted: âWell, it appears @ElonJet is suspended.â He also tweeted a screenshot of a Twitter message that read: âAfter careful review, we determined your account broke the Twitter Rules. Your account is permanently in read-only mode, which means you canât Tweet, Retweet, or Like content. You wonât be able to create new accounts.â Twitter, which under Musk has dissolved much of its media department, did not respond to a request for comment. Over the weekend, Sweeney tweeted that his account had been shadowbanned, meaning that its visibility had been deliberately reduced. âInternal messages obtained by a[n] anonymous Twitter employee explained to me that on â2 Dec[ember] 2022 your account @elonjet was visibility limited/restricted to a severe degree internally,ââ Sweeney wrote. He then included a screenshot that allegedly showed Ella Irwin, vice-president of Twitterâs trust and safety council, asking her team to apply âheavy VF [visibility filtering] to @elonjet immediatelyâ. The trust and safety council was dissolved on Monday. The same day, Sweeney tweeted that it appeared @ElonJet was no longer banned or hidden. On Wednesday, Sweeney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When Musk discovered the @ElonJet account, earlier this year, he asked Sweeney to delete it. âCan you take this down? It is a security risk,â he wrote to Sweeney, adding: âI donât love the idea of being shot by a nutcase.â In February, Sweeney told the Guardian: âAnd then he offers me $5,000 to make it harder for people to track him and to take down the account, and I make my counter-offer.â Sweeney replied: âAny chance to up that to $50K? It would be great support in college and would possibly allow me to get a car, maybe even a [Tesla] Model 3.â Musk, the owner of Tesla, which makes electric cars, declined to pay up. He eventually blocked Sweeney on Twitter.",Guardian,15/12/2022,Twitter suspends account monitoring Elon Muskâs flight paths,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/14/twitter-elon-musk-private-jet-account-suspended

The sale symbolizes a shift in the tech industry from the lavish days of the early 2000s to a more uncertain era.


","Great news, holiday shoppers: you can finally get your hands on a 100% authentic, 3ft-tall statue of the Twitter bird. An online auction next month will feature hundreds of the companyâs âsurplus corporate office assetsâ that could add a certain je ne sais quoi to any home or workplace, from bizarre decor to high-end cooking equipment. The sale comes amid Elon Muskâs chaotic $44bn takeover of the company, which has brought rapid-fire policy changes (and immediate U-turns), the reinstatement of banned accounts, and, according to Musk himself, a huge dip in advertising revenue. Itâs also involved shedding thousands of jobs â and now, apparently, shedding office furniture. A representative for the auctioneers, Heritage Global Partners, told Fortune that the auction âhas nothing to do with their financial positionâ, adding: âIf anyone genuinely thinks that the revenue from selling a couple computers and chairs will pay for the mountain there, then theyâre a moron.â Regardless of the reason, itâs hard not to see the auction as symbolic of a tech industry shift: from the heady days of the early 2000s, when endlessly wealthy platforms catered to workersâ every whim, to a more uncertain modern era. Somehow, that industrial cheese slicer just doesnât feel as necessary as it once did. Hereâs a guide to the saleâs most memorable items, in case youâre still looking for that perfect gift: A 6ft-tall planter in the shape of the @ symbol. Sure to be a hit with the tech-obsessed gardener in your life, this piece marries the ancient art of horticulture with a ubiquitous symbol of decaying public discourse. Expect heads to turn when you install this in front of your home, announcing to passersby that you have no soul. A âhigh-performance task chairâ. Nothing says high-performance like sitting down. Turn workaday programming into X-treme coding with this seat, which uses the latest in sedentary technology to shield your thighs and buttocks from direct contact with the floor. Itâs surprising Musk is willing to part with this at a time when his priorities are âextremely hardcoreâ. Kegerators. A house isnât a home without a fridge that dispenses beer. And a workplace isnât a workplace if you canât drink on the job. Imagine channeling your fluids through the same tubes that might once have lubricated the likes of the Twitter co-founders Jack Dorsey and Christopher Isaac âBizâ Stone. A rotisserie oven with 24 spits. Who could forget those late nights at the office, rustling up a snack of 24 whole chickens while sifting through hate speech? Pairs perfectly with a 20-gallon vegetable dryer. An old iMac. This computer might be out of date, but in a courageous act of corporate one-upmanship, someone stuck a Twitter sticker over the Apple logo. So thatâs pretty cool. And just think â this computer might have been the one used to ban Donald Trump! Thatâs the best of whatâs on offer for now, but stay tuned â the next Twitter-auction drop might feature everything you need for a âmodest bedroomâ.",Guardian,13/12/2022,Twitter office oddities go up for auction â from bird statues to rotisserie ovens,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/13/twitter-hq-office-auction-items
96,"Elon Musk has been promoting ""The Twitter Files,"" a series of Twitter threads from friendly journalists using material provided by the company to re-litigate the company's role in the culture wars of years past. The leaked documents focus on two high-stakes individual moderation decisions, one widely regarded as an error in hindsight and the other as divisive as anyone would have guessed beforehand. The excerpts of internal emails and chat messages show staff tackling the enormous burden that has been placed on them with a rough mixture of panic and resolve.","The threat model of a social network is complex. Your security team has to deal with conventional hacking attacks, as hostile actors probe for technical errors in your apps and servers that they can use to extract valuable private data, inject malicious code, or simply wreak havoc for fun. They also have to deal with people using the siteâs own capabilities in destructive ways, from simple-minded spam bots through to nation states carrying out âcoordinated inauthentic behaviourâ. They have to protect users from account takeovers due to password theft, and they have to do it all while navigating the minefield that is content moderation. And then the site gets bought on a whim by a capricious billionaire and the threat comes from inside the house. What are the Twitter Files? Elon Musk has been pushing âthe Twitter Filesâ, a series of Twitter threads from friendly journalists using material provided by the company to re-litigate the companyâs role in the culture wars of years past. Typically, big news stories claiming to be the [something] âfilesâ are based on enormous leaks, providing a hitherto impossible look at the inner workings of the organisation under the microscope. It is less typical for an enormous leak to have been ordered by the chief executive of the company, and executed by their subordinates openly working with the journalists reporting on the story. But little about Elon Muskâs Twitter is typical. What of the files themselves? A week and a half in, there have been four releases, from three writers: Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss and Michael Shellenberger, all broadly part of a wave of âpost-liberalâ Substack newsletter writers. Itâs unclear how they were selected to receive the documents. One requirement, however, was that everything they published be shared on Twitter itself, Taibbi has said, but beyond that âweâve been encouraged to look not just at historical Twitter, but the current iteration as well. I was told flat-out I could write anything I wanted, including anything about the current company and its new chief, Elon Musk.â At the same time, the reporting was done inside Twitterâs offices, with the assistance of Twitter staff. And all three have focused on the areas that one might guess, given their previous statements about the social network. Taibbiâs first thread covered Twitterâs efforts to respond to the New York Postâs story about Hunter Bidenâs laptop; his second thread, as well as Shellenbergerâs, looked at the events around the suspension of Donald Trump and the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Weiss, meanwhile, reported on what she described as âTwitterâs secret blacklistsâ.â Freedom of speech v âfreedom of reachâ The bulk of the material so far, then, has been focused on what are effectively two extremely high-stakes individual moderation decisions, one widely regarded as an error in hindsight (hiding stories about Bidenâs laptop), and the other exactly as divisive as anyone would have guessed beforehand (Trumpâs ban). The documents shared by Taibbi and Shellenberger largely support that reading. Shorn of the conspiratorial framing of the two writers, the excerpts of internal emails and chat messages that they have posted appear to show staff tackling the enormous burden that has been placed on them with a rough mixture of panic and resolve. In the days following the publication of the Postâs story on Hunter Biden, that wasnât enough. The executives quoted by Taibbi are clearly aware of the prospect of a repeat of 2016âs WikiLeaks dump of hacked Democratic Party documents, and move quickly to discuss enforcing a policy against sharing hacked materials. But the materials werenât hacked, and while the chain of custody of Bidenâs laptop remains murky, it rapidly became clear that the policy was wrongly applied. Twitterâs most senior staff were too slow removing the ban as that became clear, and, in Taibbiâs words, âerred on the side of â¦ continuing to errâ. Just two months later, the same group was convened to discuss Donald Trump. The president had used social media to egg on a protest in Washington DC that turned violent as his supporters decided to storm the US Capitol building. In the days since the election, Twitter had been aggressively applying its ânewsworthinessâ policy, slapping a label on posts that would be deleted were it not for the prominence of their author, but by 7 January, it was clear that was unsatisfactory in the case of Trump. A series of Slack posts shared by Shellenberger show the team, led by former trust and safety head Yoel Roth, desperately trying to invent policy on the fly (all staff except Roth are anonymised in the posts Shellenberger shared). Trump had been given special treatment, left on the site for months after a typical user would have seen his account deleted: at what point does that approach cease to be viable? The answer was clearly January 6. But if you give someone special treatment without admitting as such, it just makes it all the more difficult to take it away. Weissâs part of the saga is different. Rather than focusing on the narrow world of US electoral politics, her thread takes a more systemic look at Twitterâs moderation practices. Working with Ella Irwin, a trust and safety staffer at Twitter, Weiss published screenshots of the moderation pages for some of the siteâs most notorious users. Jay Bhattacharya, a Covid sceptic, was placed on a âtrends blacklistâ; Dan Bongino, a rightwing media personality, on a âsearch blacklistâ; Charlie Kirk, whose decision to attend a protest wearing a diaper caused such secondhand embarrassment it effectively destroyed the Republican youth movement he founded, was set to âdo not amplifyâ. The tags are various examples of what Twitter calls âvisibility filteringâ, a form of moderation that is intended to impact âfreedom of reachâ without affecting âfreedom of speechâ. Users who are filtered can post what they like, but their involvement in the algorithmic amplification of the site is limited. Some wonât show up in search results or trends; others wonât be recommended to users to follow. The most aggressive form of visibility filtering, which didnât affect any of the prominent accounts Weiss highlighted, means that new posts wonât even show up for followers, and are only visible to people who navigate directly to the posterâs profile. Not every user Weiss examined was hurt by the moderation. One, LibsofTikTok, was given special treatment, warning moderators to do nothing to it without consulting the siteâs senior team. Despite that, it had still received two strikes for abuse, and been placed on the trends blacklist. What did we learn? I think itâs important to distinguish between the Twitter files, and the âTwitter Filesâ. The latter, a big, hyped, coordinated publication, has so far failed to achieve its apparent goals. The throughline of the whole exercise is that Twitter is a hotbed of leftwing bias, explicitly aligned with the US Democratic party, and taking unwarranted action to censor speech for politically motivated purposes. The posts themselves show little of the sort. Some, like Weissâs, donât even attempt to: individual examples of rightwing users being on the end of light-touch moderation says little about overall bias. Were leftwing users also given visibility filters? Weiss doesnât say. Were rightwing users given filters more? Weiss doesnât say. Others show almost the opposite. There were plenty of easy reasons to remove Donald Trump from the social network in January 2021, but the posts seem to reveal Twitter staff methodically working through their actual rulebook, trying to understand how to react to unprecedented events in a way that doesnât simply throw precedent out the window. Like so much to do with American politics, the Files fall flat if you view the American right as an outlier. If you have rules against election misinformation and only one party engages in a systematic campaign of election misinformation, itâs not an unreasonable outcome for one party to be the focus of moderation efforts. But the lowercase files, the documents themselves, are an interesting historical artefact nonetheless. They show that, at periods of global crisis, the people making the decisions inside Twitter were acutely aware of, and uncomfortable with, the power they held. Even as a set of cherrypicked examples, they show that efforts to create and apply a consistent rulebook were driven as much by a desire to avoid criticism as a belief that doing so was important for protecting users. They give us an insight into the sorts of discussions that were likely happening at Facebook and YouTube at the same time. And they show us never to trust Elon Musk. Insider threat Musk has been promoting the series as an exercise in âtransparencyâ, and, if youâre Weiss, Taibbi or Shellenberger, thatâs what it is. But itâs the sort of transparency that companies get when their database is hacked and sold on the darknet. In this case, the database cost $44bn, and came with control of the site to boot. Marcus Hutchins, the ethical hacker who stopped the WannaCry ransomware infection, posted on Mastodon about the docs. âAs a security professional, not much scares me,â he said. âIâve seen my personal data stolen numerous times, watched nationstate hackers spray zerodays across the internet, and Iâm a shameless user of TikTok. âBut now you have someone sitting on top of the personal data of several billion users, someone who has a long track record of vindictive harassment, someone who has the ear of the far right, and someone who has just shown us his willingness to weaponise internal company data to score political points. That scares me a lot.â The Shellenberger posts named only one person: Twitterâs former head of trust and safety Yael Roth. When Musk bought the company, Roth was initially welcoming: one of the few staffers who was prepared to advocate for his boss publicly, and a much-needed source of internal expertise after the immediate sacking of Vijaya Gadde, the longtime head of Twitterâs platform safety efforts. But the relationship clearly soured. On 10 November, Roth quit, resurfacing a week later to write a New York Times post arguing that âeven as he criticizes the capriciousness of platform policies, [Musk] perpetuates the same lack of legitimacy through his impulsive changes and tweet-length pronouncements about Twitterâs rules.â In doing so, he seems to have become a bete noire for his brief boss, and so for the wider rightwing media ecosystem that Musk now conducts. The day before Shellenberger shared his part of the Twitter Files, Musk posted an out-of-context excerpt of Rothâs decades-old PhD thesis, which looked at whether services like Grindr were causing harm by forcing teenagers to pretend to be adults in order to access dating sites. To an audience of hundreds of millions, Musk accused Roth of being âin favour of children being able to access adult internet servicesâ, and indirectly accused him of personally deciding to make Twitter a safe space for paedophiles. The accusation is nonsense, but the charge, in an atmosphere of rightwing panic over âgroomersâ in the media, is life-changing. On Monday, Roth and his partner were forced to flee their home after a sharp increase in credible threats against him. For insufficient loyalty, he will have to spend the rest of his life checking over his shoulder. What will happen to the next person who annoys Elon?

","More than 30 million users are expected to leave Twitter over the next two years as concerns mount over technical issues and the proliferation of offensive content after Elon Muskâs $44bn takeover, according to a forecast. The number of global monthly users is predicted to fall by nearly 4% next year and 5% in 2024 â more than 32 million in total â in the first annual declines forecast by the market research agency Insider Intelligence since it began tracking the social media platform in 2008. âThere wonât be one catastrophic event that ends Twitter,â a principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, Jasmine Enberg, said. âInstead, users will start to leave the platform next year as they grow frustrated with technical issues and the proliferation of hateful or other unsavoury content. âTwitterâs skeleton staff, working around the clock, wonât be able to counteract the platformâs infrastructure and content moderation problems.â Its report anticipates that Twitter will lose more users in the US, its biggest market, than any other country, with numbers declining 8.2 million over the next two years. By the end of 2024, US user numbers are forecast to fall to 50.5 million, the lowest level since 2014, as the Twitter becomes âmore unstable, and less pleasantâ. In the UK, Twitter will lose about 1.6 million users over the next two years, to a base of 12.6 million, Insider Intelligence said. It predicts that while disillusioned users leaving the platform will occur across all age demographics, the biggest concentration of departers will come from the under-25 and over-45 age groups, which âarenât as loyal and are less willing to tolerate a degrading experienceâ. Insider Intelligence has also slashed its forecast for ad revenue growth for Twitter from 22% in 2023 and 16% in 2024 to âessentially flatâ, as advertisers pull back, pause or stop advertising over growing brand safety concerns on the platform. In November, the research company cut its outlook for Twitterâs ad revenue growth by 40% this year. âMuskâs primary focus in 2023 will be kickstarting Twitterâs revenue engine, after losing many of its biggest advertisers and a long tail of other advertisers who have been quietly quitting the platform,â it said.

The unpopularity of the takeover by Musk, who has fired thousands of employees and told those remaining they had to work long hours at high intensity, was summed up when the worldâs richest man received a 10-minute chorus of booing from a crowd of 18,000 when he joined the comedian Dave Chappelle on stage in San Francisco on Sunday night.",Guardian,13/12/2022,Twitter âto lose 32m users in two years after Elon Musk takeoverâ,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/13/twitter-lose-users-elon-musk-takeover-hate-speech

But Twitter informed the group via email that it was disbanding shortly before the meeting was to take place on Monday, according to multiple members. The council members, who provided to the Associated Press and other outlets images of the email from Twitter, spoke on the condition of anonymity due to fears of retaliation. âOur work to make Twitter a safe, informative place will be moving faster and more aggressively than ever before and we will continue to welcome your ideas going forward about how to achieve this goal,â said the email, which was signed âTwitter.â The news appeared to deepen the turmoil that has beset the company following Muskâs takeover. Also on Monday, it was reported that Twitterâs former top safety official, Yoel Roth, was forced to flee his home amid escalating personal attacks, including from Musk himself. Outlets including the Washington Post and CNN reported on Monday that Roth and his family fled after Muskâs tweets misrepresented Rothâs academic writing about sexual activity and children. As head of trust and safety at Twitter, Roth was involved in many of the platformâs decisions about what posts to remove and what accounts to suspend. His communications with other Twitter officials have been posted in recent days as part of what Musk has dubbed âthe Twitter files,â a series of internal documents that Musk has shared and disseminated on the platform via journalists including Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss. Muskâs tweets to his tens of millions of followers have for years prompted his supporters to deluge the targets of his ire with online threats â famously, a participant in the rescue of a boys soccer team trapped in a cave in Thailand who Musk branded âpedo guy.â But now that Musk owns one of the most powerful social networks in the world and has gutted the division that previously policed online harassment, the stakes are even higher. Muskâs recent condemnation of Anthony Fauci, the top US health official, has also drawn rebuke. Musk over the weekend tweeted: âMy pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci.â Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, called Musksâ comment âdangerousâ and âdisgustingâ in a press briefing on Monday. âThey are disgusting, and they are divorced from reality, and we will continue to call that out and be very clear about that,â Jean-Pierre said on Monday. She praised Fauciâs handling of public heath crises, including the coronavirus pandemic. Fauci, who said he planned to retire in December as Joe Bidenâs top medical adviser, has dealt with the thorny questions around health crises from HIV/AIDS to avian flu and Ebola, and has served as an adviser to seven presidents. Fauci has said he has faced death threats. He has endured criticism from Trump and various conservatives who objected to safeguards such as vaccination, social distancing and masking that he advocated to try to limit the lethality of the Covid-19 pandemic.",Guardian,13/12/2022,Twitter abruptly dissolves safety council moments before meeting,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/12/twitter-safety-council-dissolved-before-meeting
99,"Twitter is relaunching its subscription service, @TwitterBlue, on Monday. Users can pay $8 or $11 a month to gain access to exclusive features, including the blue verification tick. Subscribers will have more prominence on the platform than non-payers, with a promised boost to their replies, mentions, and search ranking. Twitter says the feature will help combat spam and scams, and plans to introduce a color-coded verification scheme. Other features include the ability to edit tweets, shorter adverts, and longer tweets. Apple users will be charged more, and Elon Musk is critical of Apple's fees.


","Twitter is relaunching its subscription service on Monday, offering users verified status for $8 (Â£6.50) a month or $11 a month on their iPhone. The move follows a botched revamp of the service last month that resulted in a host of impersonator accounts appearing on the platform as some users took advantage of the chance to launch bogus âverifiedâ accounts for major companies and public figures. Twitter said: âWeâre relaunching @TwitterBlue on Monday â subscribe on web for $8/month or on iOS for $11/month to get access to subscriber-only features, including the blue checkmark.â It added that users willing to pay $8 on the web or $11 a month via Appleâs app store would get more prominence on the platform than non-payers, promising that subscribers would ârocket to the top of replies, mentions and searchâ. Twitter said this feature would be coming soon. According to Twitterâs website, the blue tick service is âcurrently available on iOS only in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK, with plans to expandâ. Twitter said giving priority to subscribers would help combat âscams and spamâ, referring to one of the bugbears of the platformâs owner, Elon Musk, who attempted to walk away from a deal to buy the business because of his concerns over vexatious automated accounts. Subscribers who attempt to change their handle, display name or photo will temporarily lose their tick until the account is reviewed again, Twitter said. Other features offered to subscribers include the ability to edit tweets. According to a trial launched by the company in September, shortly before Musk bought Twitter, users will be able to edit a tweet up to 30 minutes after it is published â with a symbol showing it has been modified. Other planned new features include offering half the number of adverts and the ability to post longer tweets. The company also confirmed that it would introduce a colour-coded verification scheme, with businesses receiving a gold tick or checkmark and government accounts receiving a grey symbol. Twitter did not explain why Apple users were being charged more than others on the web but Musk has been openly critical of the fees charged in its app store, which takes a cut of up to 30% on sales. In a series of tweets last month, he accused Apple of threatening to block Twitter from its app store for unspecified reasons and also said the iPhone maker had stopped advertising on the social media platform. However, after a subsequent meeting with Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, he tweeted that the misunderstanding about Twitter being removed from Appleâs app store had been resolved. Musk has made clear that he wants Twitter to be less dependent on advertising, which accounted for 90% of its $5.1bn in revenues last year. That need has become more urgent after the Tesla chief executive reported a âmassive drop in revenueâ when advertisers withdrew from the platform amid concerns about content moderation, with the outbreak of âverifiedâ impostor accounts exacerbating those concerns.",Guardian,11/12/2022,Twitter relaunches blue tick service with higher price for iPhone users,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/11/twitter-relaunches-blue-tick-service-with-higher-price-for-iphone-users
